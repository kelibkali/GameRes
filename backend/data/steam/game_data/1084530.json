In the game, you can mine asteroids to gain money and spend it on building and defending your own custom maze.  The game takes place in deep-space where you command a spaceship that is in charge of defending a space station from attack. The game is divided up into two phases separated by a timer. The first being, &quot;Explore&quot;, where you use your spaceship to mine asteroids that are defended by marauding pirates and then use the proceeds to purchase maze blocks, upgrades, and defensive equipment such as turrets and ships. Once the timer reaches zero the enemy will attack your Starbase.  Try and survive as long as you can!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Build the Paths of Your Starbase with Speciality Blocks!</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1084530/extras/474a2670717eebfc2deb3109e1a2ee2e.avif?t=1658723650\" width=640 height=128 /></span><br><br>We have designed specialty maze blocks that when placed next to each other form pathways, obstructions, and different colored platforms. The various colored platforms allow you to place corresponding turrets or landing pads that allow you to fight off incoming enemies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Enemies</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1084530/extras/1c26a9ad3a6cbafc94c7a4f082aa4029.avif?t=1658723650\" width=640 height=128 /></span><br><br>The two types of enemies are separated into space ships and assault troops. Assault troops are dropped onto your space-station by transport ships and will follow your maze to the command center and damage your starbase unless killed by your turrets. Spaceships will harass and blow up your turrets and/or your spaceships.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Defend Against the Air</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1084530/extras/87dcad3f505b4c6dacba992806c85d6e.avif?t=1658723650\" width=640 height=128 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Anti-Air Turrets</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Anti-Air Turret<br></li><li> Anti-Artillery Turret<br></li><li> Shrapnel-Shield Turret<br></li><li> Missile Silo <br></li><li> Fighter Ship<br></li><li> Laser Cannon</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Keep the Starbase Safe from Ground Troops</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1084530/extras/a89e5e5c9137ab1557fb0bb560be5068.avif?t=1658723650\" width=640 height=128 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Anti-Personnel Turrets</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Puzzle_Piece<br></li><li> Gattling Turret<br></li><li> Flame-Thrower Turret<br></li><li> Forcefield Turret<br></li><li> Bomber <br></li><li> Extra-Life<br></li><li> Repair Turret</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1084530/extras/20f8ff461d6034968dc312dc8254933e.avif?t=1658723650\" width=640 height=128 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Additional Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Build/edit Maze Tiles<br></li><li>Buy, Place, and upgrade turrets and ships<br></li><li>Fly around in your spaceship and mine asteroids<br></li><li>Fight off pirates and enemy waves<br></li><li>Dock with starbase and walk around maze/starbase<br></li><li>Repair turrets by hand<br></li><li>Use turrets (which you can also hop into), spaceships, and your own personal spaceship that you can jump out of to defend your base on foot. <br></li><li>Gather resources in an asteroid belt teeming with pirates and try to survive as long as you can.</li></ul>",
