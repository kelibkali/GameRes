The goal was to develop a highly maneuverable, highly advanced stealth war machine for impervious and mountainous terrain, that can deploy unhackable low-range drones to operate in high-risk environments. The program was a full success, and the Comanche special units seemed unstoppable in their missions.<br><br>But then, when the blueprints leaked through a whistleblower website, every group and power, who could afford it, built and modified the Comanche for their own purposes. With that, a new era of helicopter warfare had begun.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1423740/extras/b7133931af157e5b5bbf217c5f5bacfa.avif?t=1727255669\" width=600 height=120 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Vehicular and close quarters combat in one</strong></h2>Steer your high-tech Comanche into air-to-air dogfights.
