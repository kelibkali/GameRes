Electrodash is a die &amp; retry where you play as a cube that must reach the finish line by bouncing off walls strewn with obstacles. Additional objective: finish the level in as little bounce as possible. Be careful though, if your cube misses a platform or encounters a trap, it will be pulverized: back to the start!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Each world has a different atmosphere and game mechanics!<br></li><li> To challenge your friends and break records, play the infinite mode generated randomly every day!</li></ul><br>Get coins by setting levels in an optimized way.
