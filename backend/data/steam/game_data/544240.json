    "description": "Kaiju-a-gogo is a strategy/action title featuring GIANT MONSTERS. The player takes on the role of a fledgling Mad Scientist who has built the first human-controlled Kaiju in the world. While your rivals race to catch up with your genius and build their own Kaiju to compete with you, you have a five-year-window to use your Kaiju to achieve TOTAL WORLD DOMINATION.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis DLC adds a new mad scientist, Doctor Malady Maleficarum, and her shape-shifting colony creature, The Grey Goop! As much fun as it is to play the other Kaiju in the game, this new monster... IT CAN CHANGE INTO THEM ALL!*<br />\r\n<br />\r\n*(a little bit, and only for a little while, but still... that's pretty neat)",
