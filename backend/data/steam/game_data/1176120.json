    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Now in anniversary Extended Edition!</h2><br>The world of <strong>ELDERBORN</strong> is an imaginary one. A fantastic vision of the ancient time of heroes, not unlike the one created by Robert E. Howard in his saga of Conan. But it’s not just pure work of fiction. We drew inspiration from the ancient Middle East cultures, and where those inspirations really shine - is the game’s soundtrack. <strong>Kacper Kajzderski</strong> uses the exotic sound of the Armenian <i>duduk</i> and Turkish <i>oud</i> and <i>zurna</i>, among other instruments, to capture the uniqueness of the game’s setting. The music, however, remains true to the modern heavy metal form, with all its defining characteristics. A touch of electronic beats and synths by Buffout Boy (Piotr Stachera) complete the eclectic, unmistakable mixture that defines the sound of <strong>ELDERBORN</strong>.",
