    "description": "Inspired by &quot;Calvinball&quot;, from the comic &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; by Bill Watterson, Bedlamball plays a bit like air hockey. Each player attempts to knock the ball into the other player's goal, but both sides can modify rules and mechanics of the game in the middle of the match to their advantage. Opponent about to score? Shrink the goal! Far behind in points? Change the scoring method! Just remember everything you change affects your opponent in the same way! Hilariously chaotic, while also surprisingly strategic, you never have to play the same way twice.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/667690/extras/3c52f8934949264a94ae349429a7170f.avif?t=1726498630\" width=156 height=156 /></span> <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/667690/extras/d12b795d7a2e9ff4cc92e09937e6575a.avif?t=1726498630\" width=156 height=156 /></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/667690/extras/a12c1f0e1893ae14fd2175c92e4c76ae.avif?t=1726498630\" width=156 height=156 /></span><br><br>Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>8 Characters, each with a unique specialty!<br></li><li>Local Versus Mode<br></li><li>2 vs 2 Team Mode!<br></li><li>Online play via Steam Remote Play Together!<br></li><li>Play solo against the AI in a regular match, or go for the most goals in Score Attack!<br></li><li>Watch the AI play against itself!<br></li><li>Stream the game on Twitch.tv and allow your audience to change rules via Crowd Control!*<br></li><li>A secret unlockable mode!</li></ul><br><br>*Crowd Control currently only available on Windows Platforms.",
