Whether through completing the Final Ritual or eliminating all opponents, the victory will not be easy. Managing a cult is a tricky job, you see. Pesky investigators, multiple offspring sects, bloodthirsty opponent cults, these are all threats that have to be dealt with or successfully evaded. And all that has to be done below the radar of the human society.<br><br>This version of the game was upgraded with a modern UI look and interface. However, the classic minimalistic black design is fully supported, too. Various long-standing bugs in the classic version were fixed and all gameplay features were backported to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the release of the first public version.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1237260/extras/da4d1e3f896dda651b710e4ed038ed7b.webp?t=1752100667\" width=610 height=50 /></span><br>Features include:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Artifacts of the Arcane Expansion</strong> - Use mysterious occult artifacts to enhance the base game.<br></li><li><strong>Multiplayer</strong> - Shared screen multiplayer is available.
