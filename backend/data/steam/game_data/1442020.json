Full speed ahead, it's high time to go hunting! The goal? Glory and precious loot in the form of a multi-ton whale. The stake? Your and your people’s life.<br><br>Did I say “people”? Of course, after all, as it has been known for a long time, you must gather your party before venturing forth. Recruit adventurous madmen to become part of your crew.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1442020/extras/d484dabffd519e157c475cc0cfff4dd9.avif?t=1733297862\" width=616 height=142 /></span><br><br>But what’s a captain without a boat? Take the helm of Essex, the legendary whaling ship Captain George Pollard Jr. used to set out on the memorable voyage of 1819, which ended with the ship colliding with a giant sperm whale and sinking at the bottom of the sea. This event inspired <strong>Herman Melville</strong> to write the famous <i>Moby Dick</i>, the novel on which Essex: The Whale Hunter is based. Now it's your turn to visit 19th century Nantucket.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1442020/extras/56ba2037aca19b78861c4890276dc0c3.avif?t=1733297862\" width=616 height=142 /></span><br><br>Track down your own Moby Dick, grab your weapons and fight an unequal battle against the sea colossus. Once you win, harvest the raw materials from the whale – you’ll monetise them when paving legal trade routes and searching for luck on the black market. Only (or as many as) a couple of accurate harpoon throws stand before you and a great fortune.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1442020/extras/b83e71eba7d7a84d460a2b057fda7e03.avif?t=1733297862\" width=616 height=140 /></span><br><br>And when the ocean turns against you, smashing your ship to smithereens and lunging you to the shore of a desert island, do your best to get out of there and return to where you belong – to the great seas.<br><br>Essex: The Whale Hunter is a 19th-century whaling simulator and a great opportunity to experience a truly Melvillian adventure, full of tension, grave dangers and whale trophies to win. Become a legend and find your Moby Dick!",
