Will you fight, or will you be consumed?</i></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The world has changed. Corporations don’t just rule industries—they rule <strong>entire cities, entire planets.</strong> X-Corp and Goliath Corp, two of the largest corporate empires in the solar system, were founded by rival siblings who inherited their father’s trillion-dollar empire. But money and power weren’t enough. Their war for dominance has shaped the modern world, pushing the limits of science, technology, and the very nature of life itself.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You are <strong>Sam</strong>, a <strong>cyborg bounty hunter</strong>, one of the many outcasts exiled after the <strong>Cybernetic Pandemic of 2044</strong>—a failed experiment where X-Corp attempted to create a <strong>Hive Mind</strong> that would link all cyborgs into a single, controllable network. Instead, it turned them into <strong>rampaging cybernetic zombies</strong>, nearly wiping out entire cities. Now, a <strong>new Hive threatens humanity</strong>, but this time, it’s not man-made.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >It’s <strong>alien.</strong></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Your Mission:</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Goliath Corp has hired you for a high-risk job: <strong>track down and capture Clark Andrews, a fugitive infected with an alien Hive Mind.</strong> The infection is spreading, and Clark may hold the key to understanding—or stopping—it. But bringing him in is only part of the job. Goliath doesn’t just want his body. They want <strong>his mind.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >With your <strong>advanced cybernetics</strong>, you are one of the few capable of <strong>entering his infected consciousness</strong>, diving into the depths of an alien intelligence that warps reality itself. As you explore <strong>Clark’s fractured mind</strong>, you will uncover horrifying truths about the Hive, its origins, and its true purpose.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >But <strong>not everything is as it seems</strong>. Goliath has <strong>other plans</strong>, and you may just be another pawn in a game played by those far more powerful. The infection is spreading. The Hive is growing. And in the end, the biggest question isn’t whether you can stop it—it’s whether you’ll survive long enough to try.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Gameplay Features:</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >*All features advertised are being developed and are subject to change but will be finalized and polished before release.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🎮 <strong>Third-Person Combat</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Engage in <strong>intense third-person firefights</strong> as you battle Hive-infected enemies and corporate assassins.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >🎮 <strong>First-Person Combat</strong></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Experience <strong>mind-bending first-person sequences underwater and </strong> as you dive into Clark’s infected brain and fight to reclaim his mind from the Hive.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🔄 <strong>Multiple Playable Characters &amp; Perspectives</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Play as <strong>Sam</strong>, the exiled cyborg bounty hunter caught between a war of corporations and an evolving alien intelligence.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Step into the shoes of <strong>Croc</strong>, a ruthless fighter forced into the chaos, battling corporate android forces.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Take control of <strong>MB (Mistake Bot)</strong>, an AI-powered machine built by a rogue Goliath employee, now hunted by the very company that created it.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🧠 <strong>A Living, Evolving Infection</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Hive isn’t just a disease—it’s an <strong>intelligent force</strong>.
