    "description": "This Gigantus was about to be discarded for technical flaws, so an engineer 'adopted' it and personally remodeled it for fun, giving a summer theme. With its weight reduced as much as possible, its mobility has been greatly improved. Its main cannon looks the same as the old one, but is now a 'Deluge Gun,' which neutralizes targets with a huge amount of water. Its body has been painted after “Natsuiro High School : Seishun Hakusho.'",
