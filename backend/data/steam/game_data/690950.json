    "description": "Standby for sprinting as you hop, jump, burrow, and sprint in this pretty mediocre puzzle-platformer. Use interesting puzzle mechanics, like the burrow power-up, on challenging systems-based puzzles that increase in difficulty and complexity as you play through the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplore the labyrinth beneath your own grave and uncover the solutions to devious puzzles in order to find the skeleton party, where you can rest your aching bones.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n When you are done with the game, compete with your friends for the best time, or if you are the creative type, use the intuitive level builder to make your own levels!",
