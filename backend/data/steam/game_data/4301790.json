To break free, you must raid explorer camps, track roaming adventurer parties, and uncover the truth behind the curse that trapped you here. The world is alive. Explorers travel in groups, speak to one another, and react to danger. You choose when to strike, when to stalk, and when to retreat.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4301790/extras/75a4ac5d8adba1146f448a898001bf7a.poster.avif?t=1770759786\" width=1170 height=658 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4301790/extras/75a4ac5d8adba1146f448a898001bf7a.webm?t=1770759786\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4301790/extras/75a4ac5d8adba1146f448a898001bf7a.mp4?t=1770759786\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Begin your journey as one of several Slimus classes, each with their own combat style and abilities. Shape your playstyle through deep build customization with over 200 unique items, powerful equipment sets, and a weapon personalization system that lets you enhance gear using rare scrolls. Each scroll grants powerful bonuses and meaningful drawbacks, consuming limited slots and forcing real decisions.
