    "description": "Terraformer Expedition to Mars is a first/third person 'Hard Science' based 3D simulation of survival, exploration and terraforming set on the planet Mars. <br><br><strong>The simulation unfolds in three parts: </strong><br><br>•The first phase is to survive on Mars using only a few canisters of oxygen, hydrogen and water and the shattered remains of your initial space craft. You will use these and the resources of the planet itself to create your own light, heat, water, air and food. <br><br>•The second phase is exploration of the planet itself: where are the other ships? Who shot you down in the first place? You will do so in a beautiful and realistically rendered 3D environment complete with dynamic interactions of light, heat, day/night cycles, and Martian geology and volcanology. <br><br>•Third and most challenging, you need to transform the lifeless, desolate and frozen wasteland into a new home for Mankind. You will do this from scratch, using constructed tools, machinery, and Earth born bacteria and plant life carefully nurtured and strategically placed. You will create a complete atmosphere, hydrosphere, and a complex biosphere - step by agonizing step - as you fight to stave off the cold, the hunger, and the loneliness of a world that will kill you without a thought, with no one to hear you scream.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Save Earth, terraform Mars.</strong></h2>",
