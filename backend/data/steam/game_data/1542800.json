    "description": "Distant Transmission is an online multiplayer messy collaborative writing and performing game about creating a radio show. A series of segments comprise each broadcast, including the news, soap operas, advertisements, and more. With a format inspired by the surrealist game Exquisite Corpse, players write the script for their broadcast by building on only what the previous player wrote. Players then blindly swap out random words in each other’s writing. Finally players record themselves performing the resulting script and listen to the assembled broadcast. Distant Transmission is designed for friends at a distance to create nonsensical stories together.",
