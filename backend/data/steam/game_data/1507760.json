    "description": "Cold Wind is a first-person game where you are going to experience yourself what it feels like to be homeless. You will be exploring a large winter city looking for food, saving yourself from cold and wind at a fire, and searching for safe shelters at night so that you may survive as long as you can. You have to constantly monitor your body temperature so that you don’t die because of the cold. To keep it high enough, you can find a warm shelter or make a fire. To recover your energy, you need to sleep. But it’s even colder at night, so you will have to find a warm shelter with no wind getting inside.",
