As such, Sumo Revise is at this time offline-only. BE ADVISED. Also, playing with 8 players simultaneously requires four gamepads, two keyboards, and a mouse. The extra keyboard is needed because keyboard hardware can only receive a few inputs at once. BE ADVISED.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p>",
