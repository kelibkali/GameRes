    "description": "Vampire Hunter Mode is an expansion to Skeleton Boomerang that adds a brand new campaign. Venture through randomly generated stages, collect powerups, battle new enemies and bosses, and attempt to take down a vicious vampire bent on creating an eternal night! But beware, whenever you fail, the night is reset once more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChat with characters new and old to help you out on your adventure, or to attempt special quests that test your ability to complete runs with a preset loadout. Complete deadly trials to win blessings, or fail them and be saddled with a terrible hex. Collect shards to buy items, or gamble them for a chance to earn greater rewards. The world and time itself is ever shifting, so there's plenty of unique experiences to be had!",
