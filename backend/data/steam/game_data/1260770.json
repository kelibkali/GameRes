    "description": "Radio Station is a single-player first-person game in which you have to get out of the existing situation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n   Sometimes, pursuing his goals, a person doesn't think about the consequences. Only one single thought appears in his head - to get what he wants by any means. This is exactly what happened with the main character - Henry. Having discarded all possible options, he decided to commit theft. Arriving at the place, Henry found what was needed, but the price was too high. Waking up from a severe headache, the main character finds himself in a well. What will you do now?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n   Be with Henry. Immerse yourself in the atmosphere of this world, go all the way from the beginning to the end and find out why it all happened.",
