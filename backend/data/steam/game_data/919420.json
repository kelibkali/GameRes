    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >INTENSE VR ACTION MEETS VIRTUAL COMIC</h2>Ever wanted to be as fast as the flash, as agile as Spiderman, or as supreme as one punch man? Now's the time! It’s time to become a hero.<br> <br>Our mission was to create an experience that throws you into the unbelievable reality of a Hero, much like the heroes and heroines we grew up reading about in various manga, as Japanese.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >- GAMEPLAY - </h2>Embody the powers of “KUROGANE” and blaze through the metropolis at hyperspeed with our fluid combat locomotion! Scale walls, leap across rooftops, and reign justice from any angle you please to sever the enemies power. Will you learn to harness the true power of a hero?<br><br>- GAME FEATURES -   <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><i>Fast-paced locomotion WITH Combat!</i><br>Unlike others titles, we’ve made it our mission to merge a great combat system with fast yet fluid locomotion. Using our new system, &quot;IDATEN Locomotion,&quot; run at hyperspeed whilst still fighting in the ways you want.<br></li><li><i>A new way of storytelling for VR! </i><br>Ever read a comic late at night only to fall asleep and dream about becoming that hero!? We’ve transitioned that nostalgia into an immersive VR experience, blending comic book with a game. At the climax of the story, you will dive into the comic and become the hero!<br></li><li><i>Epic BOSS BATTLES!</i><br>Not only will you have to traverse the environment to battle but also the opponent itself. Some of our boss battles run on the larger side :P</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >- STORY -</h2>  <br><i>Long in the distant past, there was an era where humanity flourished not via the marvels of science but through the might of the supernatural.</i><br>The island nation farthest to the east was ruled by a people called the Masked. They possessed the magic to create masks which allowed the wearers to draw out and manipulate their mental energy. <br>One day, a war had begun and the fighting grew to a ferocious intensity and warriors fell in battle one after another. By the time they had defeated most of their enemies, the Masked were on the brink of extinction.<br><br>Kurogane, the sole survivor of the Masked's warriors, and the priestess Sakuya, managed to corner the mastermind of the enemies, Asura after much hardship--<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >- WHAT TO EXPECT -</h2>BE THE HERO will have the STORY MODE and the SCORE ATTACK MODE. This demo version has only SCORE ATTACK MODE.<br><br><br>You will be the ninja hero, “KUROGANE” and fight with enemies. Slash all enemies. The score varies with “time,” “slash speed,” “the number of enemies killed in one slash,” and “the number of enemies killed in one special attack.”<br><br><br>We are planning update the following additional contents.<br>-  Storytelling by VR Comic<br>-  Additional stages and episodes<br>-  Ninjutsu (忍術) System<br>-  Replay Mode<br><br>We would like to deeply consider feedback from the players.<br>It would be great if the players could share feedback, suggestions, and any idea on the Steam forums and SNS to make this game better with us.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >- OUR GOAL -</h2>We aim to create an experience that gives you that nostalgia and wow factor from your childhood. The trouble is refining that experience; please help us by providing us with your valuable feedback, thanks.",
