During the night, enter the cursed land of Luna Nova and harvest Ambrosia to keep your village alive. But beware, the Devourer is prowling the fields and is tainting it. In a race against the clock, turn off your lantern to sneak and hide, or fight and banish the Devourer for a bigger reward.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2009620/extras/a50326fefb9ada026ec1e8bef67fd5e7.webp?t=1761215432\" width=600 height=60 /></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2009620/extras/c09d2b9e93ca15f50bbfb5cd19866c60.poster.avif?t=1761215432\" width=600 height=300 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2009620/extras/c09d2b9e93ca15f50bbfb5cd19866c60.webm?t=1761215432\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span>Tentacle creatures, poisoned waters and other dangerous calamities plague Luna Nova.
