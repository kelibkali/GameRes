Once the humans are caught they are shaved and stripped of their clothes <br>to be teleported to the UFO.<br><br><strong>Gameplay:</strong><br>Abduction Bit is a retro style game inspired by 80s arcade games like Bubble Bobble and Mario Bros, where players take control of an alien that must abduct the humans.<br>To complete a stage the players must capture all the humans without touching them and must avoid dangerous traps. <br>The player can jump on the platform and shoot - easy gameplay with high-level difficulty.<br><br><strong>Level Packs system:</strong><br>In Abduction Bit the player can select various level packs through the main menu. We'll release more packs in the future like FREE DLC.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>100% Retro look and retro sound<br></li><li>Local CO-OP (2 players)<br></li><li>Level packs with different play (and Free DLC).<br></li><li>Customize the palette of your alien<br></li><li>Save state<br></li><li>Achievements<br></li><li>Cheap price<br></li><li>Steam trading cards </li></ul>",
