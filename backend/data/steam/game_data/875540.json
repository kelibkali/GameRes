    "description": "Have you ever had so bad day that you just wanted to go away from the humanity and relax? Now you can go to the Moon. Or to the Mars. That isn't far enough? No problem, go to another star system. Check yourself why TRAPPIST-1 planets don't have any forms of life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother feature of the Virtual Telescope is to give you the actual star sky and solar system state which depend on your current geolocation and time. You can change zoom or lens size and get information about a selected object or just watch events like solar and lunar eclipses.",
