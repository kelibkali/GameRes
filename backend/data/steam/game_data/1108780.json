    "description": "Save Ireland in THE PIRATE QUEEN! The Pirate Queen is an action slasher from Cyberfox Studios. You’ll be frantically swinging your sword to take down a slew of different enemies. Make snap decisions about who to take down first before your rapidly dwindling health runs out!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStep into the shoes of Grace O’Malley, a real Irish pirate warlord from the 16th century. You will struggle to carve out a place to survive and thrive in an Ireland packed with feuding clans, and fight to unite Ireland against the threat of the British Empire. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PIRATE QUEEN features tons of different enemies and bosses that will require strategy and speed to beat, cutscenes giving you a taste of pirate life, and an endless mode to let you really push your sword fighting to the limit!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI created THE PIRATE QUEEN after being inspired and excited by Grace’s tale. Every story I heard about her was crazier than the last. I knew capturing the thrill of O’Malley’s life in a game would be something special.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PIRATE QUEEN is Cyberfox Studios’ premier game, and we’ve loved every second of making it. It isn’t without its shortcomings, but we hope our passion and excitement shines through.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYAAARGH!<br />\r\n-John Mints II<br />\r\nFounder",
