The sound of the rain, the dim glow of your candle, and the quiet inn build a powerful dread, even just from the trailer.&quot; - Joel Couture, IndieGames <br><br>&quot;The Empty Inn provides brief shelter from the high-res multiplayer madness that most of us subscribe to. It's an overnight stay in the haunted halls of your childhood nostalgia. It doesn't last long, so try to enjoy each spooky minute.&quot; - Chris Saltel, Eat-Pray-Game <br><br>&quot;[The Empty Inn] feels very Lovecraftian in its nature and captures an uneasy setting perfectly.&quot; - Dan Hartnack, IndieJuice",
