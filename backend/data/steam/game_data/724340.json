From first generation double barreled cannons, to upgraded, second generation turrets like the Deathbeam, lay waste to as many enemies as you can.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Discover components and modules for your ship<br></li><li>Upgrade by combining modules together, to create more powerful, newer generations of turrets<br></li><li>Fight bosses, and proceed in an ever increasing difficulty</li></ul>",
