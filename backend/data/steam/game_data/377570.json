Survive as long as you can against 3 types of enemies. As time goes by more and more enemies will get closer to you, and no matter where you move to because space is shrinking everything will always be getting closer.<br><br>- Versus<br>Why does it seem the Universe is so Matter biased? Shouldn't matter and anti-matter be created equaly? ...What if Matter and Anti-Matter fought it out in the early Universe? <br>Defeat your opposite to claim you position in the Universe! <br><br>- Hold The Flag<br>Another way Matter and Anti-Matter could triumph is be gaining mass. Pick up the Higgs Boson (flag) and hold it until the timer runs out.
