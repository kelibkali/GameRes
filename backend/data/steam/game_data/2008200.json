But every choice is followed by its consequences.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2008200/extras/dc9a99b3df1295abee77f681349398be.webp?t=1713880013\" width=628 height=33 /></span><br><br>Ashen Knights is a unique mixture of two complementary gameplays. Tired of managing your stamina and scrupulously calculating your attacks? The game will grant you an opportunity to destroy foes in dozens with a single sweep of your weapon. Bored without a decent challenge? Try slaying an enemy ten times stronger than you are.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2008200/extras/eeac0d0d19c9ef138424bf514df9e889.poster.avif?t=1713880013\" width=628 height=182 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2008200/extras/eeac0d0d19c9ef138424bf514df9e889.webm?t=1713880013\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2008200/extras/eeac0d0d19c9ef138424bf514df9e889.mp4?t=1713880013\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2008200/extras/4490b88e14dc904a9ddd2ad53f277961.avif?t=1713880013\" width=628 height=65 /></span><br><br>In Ashen Knights, the gameplay is but a way to share and express emotions.
