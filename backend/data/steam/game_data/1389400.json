    "description": "Electronics operatives planted a bug in the target computer system that had been encrypting in 168-bit 3DES. Text downloads from the remote target is available through your terminal. Your mission is to recover the keys.<br><br>Your coworkers are collecting texts that are protected with a more sophisticated encryption algorithm called 3DES (or Triple-DES). You are presented with challenging mathematical and computational problems requiring the use of other attack techniques. In hopes of finishing the problem solving with the least amount of work and memory, while considering the technological limitations or your computer systems, you carefully design and implement your attacks.<br><br>The story system generates dynamic scenarios and problems, and the menu system allows the user to select techniques and parameters. The system executes the attacks based on the choices regardless of better or worse solutions. The user sees the outcomes of what happens in a successful or unsuccessful mission.<br><br>New Techniques:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Related-key slide<br></li><li> Related-key differential<br></li><li> Key collision</li></ul><br>New Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Meticulously simulates techniques on the full 168-bit encryption<br></li><li> Instant completion of detailed statistics through a stochastic process<br></li><li> Text-based user interface</li></ul>",
