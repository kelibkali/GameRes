    "description": "Advanced Map Generation is a simulation of Earth using natural processes and realistic formulas. Its primary purpose is to teach about worldbuilding from the perspective of real-world equations. These processes include Solar Insolation (heat from the sun and atmosphere), the Coriolis Effect, Oceanography, and several others (this will list be expanded in the future). Wherever possible, the links to these sources and additional equations are included.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game will be expanded in future into a survival game utilizing these concepts (in 1-3 years). This program was made using the Godot Game Engine.",
