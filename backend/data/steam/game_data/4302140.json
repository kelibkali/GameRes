I like difficult games with simple mechanics, so this is my take on simplifying the mechanics, while delivering a challenging experience. Also, I figured out a way to spawn 2000 enemies on screen, at once, in Unreal Engine. I'm pretty proud of myself. LOL</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >How to Play the Game</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >There are 4 heroes in the game.
