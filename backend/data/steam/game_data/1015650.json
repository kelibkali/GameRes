    "description": "The (Virtual) Reality Museum of Immersive Experiences is a very special kind of museum. It exhibits projects originally designed for large-scale immersive environments in a simulation that is true to the physical manifestation of these systems.These systems include 360 degree panoramic and hemispherical projection screens, stereoscopic 3D multi-view installations and a number of spatial and experimental video installations. Situated in a large derelict warehouse, the 3D museum is freely navigable and the many exhibits can be explored interactively. A wide variety of content is accessible, ranging from the arts to research project outcomes. There are even demonstrations of VR projects within this virtual museum.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>works on HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and Windows Mixed Reality headsets<br></li><li>18 immersive systems and platforms<br></li><li>34 different projects<br></li><li>18 projects in stereoscopic 3D<br></li><li>1:40 h duration of his definition video content   <br></li><li>2000 sqm exhibition space<br></li><li>detailed information and catalogue pages for each project and platform (internet connection required)<br></li><li>capture photos of your experience<br></li><li>intuitive VR UI<br></li><li>please note, some featured projects are represented as trailers or excerpts.</li></ul><br>More info, visit <br>Link to games Key page .<br><br>Immersive display and interaction environments and systems have been utilised in simulation, visualisation, entertainment, the arts and museological context for a long time before VR made its resurgence only a few years back. Applications and experiences created for a specific physical immersive platform rely on the complex and costly technical infrastructure they were originally designed for. Descriptions and video documentation only go so far in illustrating an immersive experience. The embodied aspect, the emotional engagement and the dimensional extend, central to immersion, is mostly lost in translation. The idea behind this project is to provide a framework to showcase and for the conservation and preservation of immersive experiences and architectures outside specialised facilities and labs.<br>This simulation gives a good sense of how an immersive experiences functions in regards to scale, field-of-view, peripheral vision, audience viewing position and perspective. It is able to preserve what an experience felt like.<br><br><strong>Acknowledgements</strong><br><br><strong>Systems:</strong> EPICylinder; Design: S. Kenderdine, J.
