    "description": "EZ360 combines an automatic 360° VR player with remote VR content distribution. This allows you to distribute VR content to headsets all over the world without the need to manually transfer content files to the computer.<br><br>The EZ360 Cloud application automatically downloads new content that has been uploaded from the online portal. When the download is complete you can watch the content in the VR player, even when offline. Playing content is fully automatic. The content starts automatically when you put on a headset and when the headset is taken off, the content stops. This removes the hassle that other VR players bring by providing a much easier interface. <br><br><strong>Features</strong> <br>- Ultra user friendly<br>- Mono + Stereoscopic 360 videos<br>- 2D regular videos<br>- 180 videos<br>- Spatial Audio (.tbe) <br>- .MP4 Video format <br>- Add custom logo, background and video thumbnails<br>- Much more..",
