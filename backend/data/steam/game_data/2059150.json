    "description": "Lost and Hound's soundtrack is upbeat, bouncy and encouraging in nature. It's a bright, energetic take on the Bluegrass genre, famous in the American south. <br />\r\nThe music uses acoustic instruments such as mandolin, guitar, banjo, dulcimer, upright bass and occasionally cello. It was all written and recorded by Brian Fairbanks of Daisy Ale Soundworks.",
