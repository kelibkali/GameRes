    "description": "This demo is created on January 27th, 2016. That said, there are plenty of things at this point that have been used as either work-in-progress material or things exclusively for the demo presentation. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, the main course of the demo is the level featured within, which will be one of the eight levels in the final game. It takes place in the laboratory of Dr. Otto, who has been interrogated by Missileman and Firefryer for a case that you will know about once you play through the full version. The demo also features a glimpse of navigating through ABSO Robo High School, with an Arena and hallways prepped for looking through, and NPCs to talk to.",
