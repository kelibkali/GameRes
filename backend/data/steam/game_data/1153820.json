    "description": "Join the Whisper and get the OST of the demo composed by Fear And Trembling !<br><br>In the mist of time, society is eaten by industry, and its citizens oppressed by an authoritarian and omniscient cult. The Whisper, a violent-tempered anarchist, dreams about a revolution that will destroy the order of things. He devotes himself to expose the dark side of those in power and bring awareness to the people. His obsessive quest for the ultimate truth will throw him into a world of betrayal and sorcery where the only certainty is the imminent end of the world. That's a bleak setting ! BUT there is good music !<br><br>Tracklist (mp3)<br><br>01-Valentina [3:44]<br>02-Lost Factory [2:39]<br>03-Investigate [1:49]<br>04-Metropolis [2:19]<br>05-Blind City [3:42]<br>06-After Dark [3:58]<br>07-Heavy Atmosphere [3:25]<br>08-Danger Behind You [3:33]",
