    "description": "Agony Online is the world's first ever mix of MMORPG &amp; Battle Royale on a monumental scale that is made by independent developers that want to play their own game. Players can choose to join Battle Royale, or continue playing the Horror MMORPG. The massive 30 Mile / 48 Kilometer apocalyptic island explodes and burns with hell fire killing 100s of players not quick enough to make it to the safe zones.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Discord:</h2>Join our Discord and talk to the Dev Team today!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story:</h2>Hell has risen and taken over the world, the last of humanity is in hiding. Your family was killed and your child was tortured to death by demons. Satan then cursed you with immortality so you can never leave this Hell on Earth. You kill yourself, but after dying, you always wake up somewhere else. You find out that you're a part of a prophecy to team up with others like you to destroy Satan in a final battle to save the world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Movement Information:</h2>In Agony Online supports both WASD &amp; Point-Click movement, whatever sits your style.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >10,000 Player Battle Royale Information:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>All players that register for Battle Royale are teleported randomly across to a 40km/25mile size Battle Island which slowly explodes and bursts into fire as the island becomes unstable. </li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>To get weapons and armor, players kill zombies which drop randomized gear.  Alternately, treasure boxes spawn which you can also obtain random  weapons/armor. </li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>To get higher grade gear, you can either hunt players and steal their loot, or kill bosses which also spawn.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >MMORPG Information:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Upon launch, level cap will be 30, then as the game progresses with more players, we will raise the level cap as we release more content. PvP will be heavy in this game; guilds can declare war and battle anywhere in the open world. With our World War system, every weekend, all guilds fight over an area in a &quot;King of The Hill&quot; style battle. The winning guild that holds the position wins, that guild controls the tax rate across the world and collects all the tax money. </li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Main Story Line: Your body was dragged from a fire into town, you woke up the next day and went back to search for your family, you found your  daughter's body torn apart with your wife still dying. She points to a  hill outside before she dies. Satan murdered your family, when you kill  one of his possessed vessels, he laughs and curses you with eternal life - now you wake up somewhere every time you die, never escaping Hell on Earth to be with your dead family. Join others like you to get stronger together and save the world that Satan has taken over in a final battle. </li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Side Quests: Story lines can be very boring, we smash the skip button the moment we see it. In AO, we made quests full of memes and jokes.<br></li><li>Maybe a crazy homeless guy with crazy eyes wants to order a pizza with gumballs on it and him and his pet cat discuss bitcoin investments. </li></ul>",
