    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong></strong></h2>The 11th volume in our Mythic Monsters series, Mythic Monsters: Devils brings you a dozen and one subtle and sinister foes that are quite literally diabolical! Some are content merely to flay your PCs' bodies, cleaving between flesh and bone with deadly keenness, while others are devoted to seduction, corruption, and inveiglement of heart, mind, and soul unto eternal damnation. From whispering imps to terrifying pit fiends that claim lordship over the deepest circles of Hell, these devils fill every niche, with militant levaloch warmonger devils and erinyes to sibilant legalists like the contract devil and heresy devil. The wicked gylou handmaiden devils terrorize the innocent while the sinister salikotal vengeance devils bring Hell's cold and pitiless justice to those who put a foot wrong with their dread masters or have the temerity to try to break a contract signed with the powers of Hell. As if these mythic devils were not enough, Mythic Monsters: Devils also details the inquisition and confession of one bound far too deep in diabolical dabblings, along with an expansion of the devil-bound template to encompass a broader swath of devilkind, as well as introducing a brand-new devil, the lisslefer temptation devil, the kind of serpent that makes an offer too enticing for many to refuse. The 13 devils contained herein, ranging in CR from 3 to 25, are updated for the mythic rules, and when we say updated we mean complete stat blocks, yes, but more than that every one has its own unique and exciting new mythic abilities, from a mythic erinyes' entangling triptych and infernal desecration to the cremation and ineffable damnation of a mythic pit fiend!<br>The Mythic Monsters series from Legendary Games brings you dynamic and exciting mechanics alongside evocative and cinematic new abilities that really help creatures live up to their flavor text, whether they are creatures of real-world myth and legend or creatures born out of the RPG tradition itself. These creatures can work just as well in a non-mythic campaign as they do in one that incorporates the full mythic rules, as you can throw them at your jaded players who think theyve seen it all or know the standard monster stats as well as you do. That look of surprise and What was THAT? will warm any GMs heart.<br>This supplement is a terrific complement to the Mythic Monster Manual, with over 220 mythic monsters and an awesome array of monster-focused abilities, feats, and more for your Pathfinder game!
