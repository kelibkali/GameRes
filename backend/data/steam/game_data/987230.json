In the beginning they were alone living in a shadowed world of all that had been created; a desolate realm of peace and possibility. <br><br>However, Evelyn did not like the loneliness of the world, being frozen in time, and longed for more... Whereas Adaroth reveled in the peace that nothingness and darkness provided. <br><br>In these dark days Evelyn brought light to the world, and with it came life. She created great masterpieces of plants, animals and people, embodying what the realm of Anaria is today. She worked tirelessly and the more she made, the more fulfilled she became. On the contrary, Lord Adaroth was miserable, finding the chaos of the uncontrolled creation process too much to bear and strived to bring darkness and stillness back to the world. <br><br>For thousands of years the two gods clashed with one another, one wanting to create and one wanting to destroy. Both being immortal and unable to stop the other, the battle waged on until this very day.  In this story you play as the Grand Master of most powerful military holy order in the realm and Evelyn has tasked you with the quest to end their war once and for all.",
