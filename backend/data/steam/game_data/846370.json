Pilot your ship and touch the colored orbs to collect them.</strong><br><br>But the challenge lies in your ability to target the right orbs and accurately touch them in succession!  There is no grid.  The orbs are floating around.  Collecting orbs of the same color in a row will create chain combos!  The bigger your chain, the bigger your reward.  But all this happens in a fully seamless world packed with blocks, bombs and teleporter portals.<br><br>There is an Arcade mode where you play through the story by completing missions.  There is also a Challenge mode, where you determine your skill rank by playing Obostar games with different difficulty levels!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/846370/extras/2bc78f07d3298380e249c949b8ac6d77.avif?t=1525192660\" width=600 height=330 /></span><br><br>There is an Arcade mode where you play through the story by completing missions.
