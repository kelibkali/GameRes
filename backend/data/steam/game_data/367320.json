    "description": "<strong>PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THIS IS AN OLDER DEMO, SO YOU MAY RUN INTO ISSUES NOT REFLECTED IN THE MAIN GAME</strong> This is the first 40 mins of 'Albino Lullaby', a horror adventure game that doesn't rely on jump scares or gore. A Lynchian psychological nightmare where you play as yourself trying to escape from a dark and surreal Victorian town that clings to the precipices of underground cliffs. The gamespace dynamically twists and contorts around you in real time, as you unravel an equally twisted narrative. Discover the hidden spaces haunted by 'The Grandchildren' as you uncover clues to understanding just where and what you are. Albino Lullaby is set for initial release on the PC and will be fully VR compatible.<br><br><br>Developed by Ape Law. To make game for to give to man! Ape Law exists to explore and experiment with games as the next great storytelling medium and was formed by Justin Pappas in the summer of 2013 in Cambridge, Mass. Justin has worked as a level designer on games like 'BioShock: Infinite' and the 'Tomb Raider' reboot and moved onto the indie scene in 2011 as the level design lead on 'Chivalry: Medieval Warfare'. He is now the creative director and level builder/designer for 'Albino Lullaby'. The studio is comprised of other industry vets, who have worked on a myriad of games from 'Borderlands' to 'Lord of the Rings Online' and at studios like Warner Brothers, Hasbro and Harmonix.
