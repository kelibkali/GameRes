    "description": "<strong>Despoiler is a Team Objective Arena Racer like no other. </strong> <br>Pilot your hovercraft across the desolate wildlands, scavenging valuable scrap you need to unlock utilities, upgrades, and win the game. It is a game of strategic and competitive escalation. Weak early game performance will have a flow on effect to late game. Don't get too comfortable though: it's possible to snatch victory from the jaws of a crushing defeat.<br><br><strong>Main features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>5v5 online<br></li><li>Team Objective multiplayer<br></li><li>Unique 'strategic escalation' focused game-mode<br></li><li>Physically simulated hovercraft<br></li><li>Beautiful environments and vehicles<br></li><li>Intelligent AI Opponents (optional)<br></li><li>Powered by Unreal Engine 4</li></ul><br>In Despoiler, teams scavenge valuable scrap from the level, and the team with the most at the end of a match wins. Scrap can be found scattered about the environment - left by the miners who've long vacated the land. Their old silos are also still full of the stuff, so tear them apart with your weaponry and make it rain. Scrap is carried on the hull of your hovercraft where it absorbs damage, functioning like armour, but it's also heavy so the more you have the slower your vehicle will get.  Choose to bulk up and tank damage or run rings around your foes.<br><br>Drop scrap off at your teams base to unlock Utilities and new Vehicles, equipable in the upgrade garage. Careful though, re-spawning costs your team some scrap, and if left unchecked you can find yourselves set back significantly if you feed the enemy too much. If you do fall behind, you can always make a run on the enemy scrap reserves, clawing your way back into the lead.",
