    "description": "Mort's Dream Jump is a fun, fast-paced platformer that challenges you to beat a series of handcrafted levels using a variety of tools. Double jumps, light dashes, jet packs, and the omnimover are all at your disposal as you navigate obstacles and make your way through each stage. Unlock new stages by collecting challenge stars and make your way through Mort's bizarre dream.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis early demo is a proof of concept and example for the kinds of single-screen stages you can expect in the full title. Rather than develop in private, I'll be posting new builds directly to Steam, where you can try new stages and help shape the development of the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll art assets, music, and stages are in a very work-in-progress state, and do not reflect the final version of the game.",
