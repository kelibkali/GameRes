    "description": "Players may have noticed that Ringo was no longer the same person when the main game started after the prehistory. But what happened in this &quot;missing&quot; year? When you recall your memories, it's usually not so easy to pinpoint the exact day when something went differently. Although Ringo had &quot;that day&quot; later, there were a lot of little things about this missing year that gradually changed him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd to give you an example, I want to share with you the day Ringo quit karate in this manga. Maybe this will clarify something about Ringo for you, or at least give you some hints.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLocation: \\steamapps\\common\\The friends of Ringo Ishikawa",
