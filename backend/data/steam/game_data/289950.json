    "description": "In <strong>Construction Simulator 2015</strong>, you take the controls of 16 realistic construction machines made by <strong>LIEBHERR</strong>, <strong>STILL</strong> and <strong>MAN</strong> with high-quality 3D graphics.<br><br>Excavate the foundation of a house with realistic machines, pour concrete into the wall panels of a factory with an enormous concrete pump, or test the steadiness of your hands by placing gigantic roof trusses with a mobile crane. Thanks to the realistic controls, you can steer an excavator with two joysticks using SAE controls and feel as if you are working on a real construction site.<br><br><br><strong>Discover the world on your own or with your friends!</strong><br><br>Explore an expansive, freely navigable world with various towns, fields, and even a highway – you will find a variety of new challenges for your constantly growing motor pool. If you are successful, then even larger and more lucrative jobs and various office locations with even more possibilities will beckon.<br><br>Work is more fun with friends, and construction is no exception. Operate vehicles with friends in multiplayer mode, and complete construction missions together or just play around in the wide-open game world.<br><br>Up to four workers can participate in multiplayer games.
