Collect pieces of the story while freely floating through related environments and immerse yourself into an intriguing story filled with blood and murder. <br><br>A must have for any true fan of thrillers and anyone how enjoys a murder mystery that goes beyond the normal story telling.<br><br><br><strong>How does the gameplay work?</strong><br><br>You will play as a free-floating ghost like creature. <br>Basically, as the soul of someone who is experiencing the story. <br>You are very small in comparison to the surroundings and can fly freely through the area. <br>You start by exploring the area and enjoying the feeling of flying as well as the gentle yet mysterious background music. <br><br>Soon after starting to explore, you will find the first memory piece. <br>You can collect the memory pieces to continue with the story and to advance with the overall narration. <br>The story talks about a young boy, about his live and about how everything changes. It is setup as a thrilling murder mystery and acts as a contrast to the somewhat calm and enjoyable gameplay. <br>You fly towards another memory piece and collect it. <br>Once you collected the memory piece a nearby book opens and a couple of words are floating out of the book.<br>Just like that the environment will often react and reflect on the advancing story and will abstractly represent some of the things that happen in the story and that are on the mind of the young boy. <br><br>The first levels are quite straight forward but the further you advance the more surreal and abstracted the levels become. <br>Once you have finished a chapter by collecting all memory pieces and finishing the overall story of a level you will continue into the next chapter. <br>There are 16 chapters in total and each abstractly represents the story part that you are currently experiencing and has its very own theme and twist to the story.",
