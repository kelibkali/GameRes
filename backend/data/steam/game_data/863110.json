Or that is what they think! What the end up hunting is a far greater horror and leads them into great peril.<br>If your heroes want to see battle then A Brief Encounter is for them! Hired as mercenaries, our heroes are ordered to rid the land of some persistent orc raiders.<br>When you are hired to escort some livestock to the local overlord for tribute it seems like an easy way to earn some money. However this is quickly forgotten as at every step along the way the heroes are attacked by a variety of opponents - in Taxation Troubles.<br>The Haunted Woods harbour trouble for our heroes. After pitching camp near a dark mysterious forest everything seems peaceful until one of the characters spy a strang pale white light approaching their camp. It is a Fey Knight who commands the characters to track and kill a strange creature which is causing much concern to the local inhabitants.<br><i>Within this product you will find:</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>55 Story entries that describe the action<br></li><li>8 NPCs and Monsters to challenge players</li></ul><strong>Requires the Hellfrost Players Guide</strong><br><i>Fantasy Grounds Conversion:</i><strong> Kevin Doswell</strong><br><strong>Requirements:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Savage Worlds ruleset.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Kevin Doswell</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
