    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >  <i>  Barbarians of Lemuria</i>  </h2><i>  Barbarians of Lemuria: Mythic Edition - fast, rules-lite, sword and sorcery roleplaying in the Lands of Lemuria. The Second Age of Man is a savage time of sorcery and bloodshed, where strong men and beautiful women battle with warlords, priests, magicians and gladiators to carve a bloody path to the Throne of Lemuria...</i><br>Barbarians of Lemuria is a heroic role-playing game set firmly in the sword-and-sorcery genre. Lemuria is a post-apocalyptic world thousands of years in the future and unrecognizable to anyone from today. The continent has returned to an almost prehistoric state – a land of steaming jungles, vast untamed wildernesses, horror-filled swamplands, and sunbaked deserts. Massive man-eating beasts roam the unexplored regions of Lemuria and beyond, from island-sized sea serpents capable of sinking wargalleys, to the huge jungle-dwelling dinosaurs that can swallow a man whole.<br>BoL encourages you to play a sullen northern barbarian, a savage jungle tribesman or cunning desert nomad and play it to the hilt.<br>BoL splits the skulls of all other fantasy games to the teeth with a single, savage blow. A simple system that effortless recreates a specific genre leading to swift, exciting play.<br>At it's core, BoL is perhaps one of the best RPGs I have ever played. Simple and intuitive, the rules blend into the background and let you get on with the adventure.<br>This complete ruleset includes fully interactive character sheets, combat tracker and skills resolution. It includes the full Mythic Edition rulebook and a series of short adventures.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Marcus Hill</strong><br><i>  Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i>    Marcus Hill[/b]<br><strong>  Requires:</strong>   The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Barbarians of Lemuria ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
