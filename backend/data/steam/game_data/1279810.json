Zeph must use her solar powers of fire, light, and gravity in order to utilize parts of the world to solve puzzles and collect the mosaic pieces.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTraverse through three unique environments as you help Zeph collect the mosaic pieces. Melt your way through the snow, climb around the caves, and bring life back to the forest all while encountering the rifts that have sprung up and help Zeph warp reality to accomplish her goal.",
