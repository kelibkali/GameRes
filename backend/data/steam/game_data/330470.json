    "description": "Made with love, &quot;Over The Void&quot; is an experience, an exploration of a strange, beautiful and sometimes psychedelic universe. An original 3D platformer in which you will rediscover the art of wandering...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach level is a unique universe to explore, but they all have a common point: the VOID. To get through each of them, you will have to find a way to open the doors which are over the void! Use the tools at your disposal to move in a 3 dimensional environment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeware: Gravity is your main enemy. One misstep and it will be quickly over.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main intention of this game is to make you feel relaxed! Empty your mind, wander around, enjoy the view, the colors, the forms and the amazing music.<br />\r\nBut still, you have to move with dexterity to avoid falling down. It's like having a walk in an abstract street with abstract bridges and caves, wherein you can throw platforms in the air and jump on as if you were dreaming.<br />\r\nFly away like nothing else matters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKEY FEATURES:<br />\r\n- Original, beautiful and totally unique universe<br />\r\n- Simple and funny platformer mechanics<br />\r\n- Dexterity and contemplation combined<br />\r\n- 9 unique levels to unlock<br />\r\n- No princess to save",
