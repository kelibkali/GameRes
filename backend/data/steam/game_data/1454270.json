Creating a game that can be played &quot;<i>theoretically</i>&quot; forever might seem like a foolish idea, but somehow, it's working! (If not us, then who?)<br><br>This game is the result of collaboration among three industry colleagues, each with a background in different studios across various eras, some of which we share. We're devoting our spare time to this endeavor. Though it's a gradual process, it's unfolding beautifully.<br><br>Our goal is to create a genuinely enjoyable and scalable game that players can engage with over the long term. By continuously adding new content along the journey, we're crafting an experience that players can wholeheartedly immerse themselves in.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Team</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Models: AXIOS<br></li><li>Code: Esteban Pisera<br></li><li>GD: Hernán Smicht</li></ul>",
