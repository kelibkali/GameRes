Younger kids can choose to play the game only with addition and subtraction and only with numbers ranging from 0-50 at the ”easy” or “normal” level, whereas eight and nine-graders can choose to use all math operations and numbers between 0 and 1000 at the “hard” level. This feature is called “For educators” because parents, tutors or teachers can keep track of correct and wrong answers for each math operation and number range.  REVIEWERS:  “Math Games – Zeus vs. Monsters has multiple goals, one of them is helping the kids sharpen their ability to stay focused for longer periods of time, change their perception of math, and see it like a fun way to spend time, and not just a boring and hard thing to do, also, kids will come in contact with some of the most common Greek symbols and mythology characters and stories…”",
