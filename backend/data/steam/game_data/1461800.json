    "description": "<strong>Eggs Catcher VR</strong> is a modern interpretation of the good classics. Leading plot outline will remain the same - the main goal of a player is to catch as many eggs as possible using a special basket and receive points for it.<br>The eggs move along their own trajectory, while the speed is getting faster in each round, which means that you are going to have to maneuver. Thanks to virtual reality, the player becomes the character's arms and eyes. <strong>Eggs Catching VR</strong> has a fitness mode, which will give you an opportunity to track how many calories you burned while chasing the catch. You will have to work hard, as the number of chutes, from which the eggs are rolling, is increasing by minute. <br><strong>Egg Catching VR</strong> introduces interesting novelties, which make the process even more enjoyable. Each round will give you an opportunity to try something new. For example, there are new bonus eggs in green colour, which will give players additional points. Their opposite is red eggs. They may explode and destroy everything you have caught already.  <br><strong>Eggs Catcher VR</strong> provides more than just entertainment. It is a real attention and concentration training, since the player’s catch is very fragile. A VrGal bunny will provide support and comment on what the player does. This character is perfectly voiced and reacts to everything that is happening in the game. <br>According to critics, Eggs Catcher VR is a perfect example of what a modern virtual reality project should look like. It has a dynamic plot, moral motives and elements of physical activity. Also, Eggs Catcher does not require any special skills - it is suitable for everyone who wants to play. It is a fusion of good traditions and trends of the future. This game will help you develop your reaction and dexterity, carefully think through your tactics and strategy, and encourage you to think outside the box.",
