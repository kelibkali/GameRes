Following the invasion of Iraq, Private Military Contractors(PMC) become the preferred instrument of foreign policy by Petro-Monarchies in the failed states of the Middle East. Staffed with US special operations combat veterans, PMC select, train and lead armies of local nationals in conventional and unconventional warfare operations.
