    "description": "Jamie's Dream is a short, emotional, experimental, psychological horror narrative experience and also the first project being developed by the small independent studio CartonBox. The main character in this thriller is Jamie, who walks through nightmares while being tormented by fears and memories of recent events, revealed as the player goes deeper and deeper into the abyss of Jamie's mind. This game is being developed with the focus on it's narrative component, but there will be small puzzles to be solved and decisions to be taken. This will also be a very short game, we are currently aiming at a 30 min gameplay, with the possibility of multiple endings and paths along the way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game was initially created as an entry to the stop-motion 2017 game jam.<br />\r\nIt also carries inspirations from games like Pinstripe, Little Nightmares, Neverending Nightmares, Inside and The Dream Machine.",
