You need to stop them! With three levels of intensity and the Aliens able to spawn through the portal in time with pumping music can you keep up with the battle, stop your enemies stealing your goods and get a high score. Who is the best amongst you and your friends. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome of the Aliens are carrying explosives to blast more crystal from the rocks, shoot those aliens first and they'll blow up all of the aliens around them! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis fast paced, single player, loud and energetic game is a great entry experience for new VR users at events or tradeshows where needing to know the full range of handset controller functions is not required.
