Featuring multiple game modes including Battle Royale modes.<br><strong>Also including full offline support with bot ai for practice!</strong><br><br><i>With each passing day the situation grows more and more dangerous as the virus continues to spread, infecting and killing everything in its path.<br>You are a specially trained operative that will drop into the infected region via an air-drop and attempt to recover artifacts from the infected and eradicate any that remain in the region.<br><br>The world is now sprawling with infected monsters and zombies. Be careful out there!</i><br><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/775620/extras/42f350240041ced579aa0145eb8e6f62.avif?t=1714535551\" width=444 height=154 /></span><br><strong>Multiple Game Modes</strong><br>Each player is pitted against Zombies, Monsters and each other. When a player kills zombie's they collect the elusive &quot;V&quot;, which can then be used to track down monsters.<br><br>The game features multiple game modes with different objectives. In each mode the player will gain experience in the form of an in-game currency. This can be obtained from completing objectives, killing and harvesting monsters, killing zombies, and killing other players. Currency can then be used to purchase in game cosmetics.<br><br><strong>Battle Royale:</strong><br>Standard Battle Royale mode featuring a moving and shrinking &quot;safe zone&quot; <br>Players can select a parachute location at the start of the match. <br>Each player starts with only a Melee weapon. <br>The players sole objective is to be the last man standing! <br>This mode is permeant death. <br><br><strong>Battle Royale Training:</strong><br>Battle Royale Training is the same as the Battle Royale mode, but the player gets to choose a weapon loadout at the start of each spawn and starts with 3 lives. <br><br><strong>Extraction:</strong><br>Extraction does not feature a safe zone like the previous modes, the goal is simply to obtain an Artifact by harvesting a monster, and then reach an extraction point within the time limit. <br>Players can only extract if they have an Artifact on them at the time of extraction. <br>Players are rewarded for extracting, and extra points based on how many Artifacts they have. <br>Extraction points are activated 10 minutes after the match has started. <br>Each player starts with only a Melee weapon. <br>This mode is permeant death. <br><br><strong>Extraction Training:</strong><br>Extraction training is the same as the Extraction mode, but the player gets to choose a weapon loadout at the start of each spawn and starts with 3 lives. <br><br><i>*All modes can be played with or without AI. All modes also support offline play or host your own servers on a LAN.</i><br><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/775620/extras/541fdd8b4e8950ea0bcb05132c17131d.avif?t=1714535551\" width=444 height=154 /></span><br><strong>Weapons and Attachments!</strong><br>Fight or Flight was built with realistic weapon ballistic simulation for a tight shooter experience.<br><br>Your player can carry 1 weapon of each class (eg, Pistol, Assault, Sniper), for a total of 3 weapons, and 1 melee weapon, which every player will start with.<br><br>Each weapon has unique damage, recoil, and bullet flight characteristics, including a penetration and ricochet system. <br><br>Each weapon can have a barrel attachment, such as a compensator or suppressor and a sight or scope attachment depending on the weapon.
