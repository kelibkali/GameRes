    "description": "Designed from the ground up for the HTC Vive, Killer Klownz is an exhilarating VR Wave Shooter. Spawning from behind over-sized children’s toys and circus props, clowns from your worst childhood nightmares are coming to get you.  Driven by an unimaginable rage, they want nothing more than to claw out your eyes and tear the flesh from your bones. A dark sky and thick fog obscure your view -- only as they close in can their terrifying faces can be seen. Armed with automatic weapons and an endless supply of ammunition, how long you survive is determined only by your accuracy and willingness to kill.<br><br>Killer Klownz features full roomscale support and dynamically adjusts its map to fit to your play space. Various types of enemies with varying degrees of speed and strength keep the game action challenging and unpredictable.  <br><br>Do you have what it takes to survive wave after wave of Killer Klownz?<br><br><i>WARNING: This game is not for the faint of heart. If you truly are afraid of clowns, this may be too intense for you. In testing, multiple players bowed-out within seconds citing extreme anxiety. Players are advised to self-monitor stress-levels.</i>",
