Not much is known <br>about what exactly is in the sauce or what makes it so addictive. Rumour says it is collected rather than made from within a temple that BFC purchased under dubious circumstances. <br><br>The temple and the Blue Hot Sauce are regarded with such significance that BFC made the temple their official HQ. Security is tight at the facility and they only employ the local jungle inhabitants to work there for fear of the secrets getting into the hands of rival fast food chains.<br><br>Unconfirmed reports from workers speak of a legend written on the walls deep within the temple. It is said that tampering with the mysterious blue sauce will bring about a dreaded curse too terrible to imagine!<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/658780/extras/b7dee760998313bb055f37fb7f1932a7.avif?t=1736181983\" width=567 height=113 /></span>",
