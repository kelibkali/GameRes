    "description": "It's a maze game with 60 progressive difficulty levels, that starts from very easy to more complex.<br />\r\nAt the start of the game it has one key for the exit door of that level and go to the next level.<br />\r\nAs you progress from level to level you have to find more keys to get out of that level.<br />\r\nThere are a total of 12 color coded keys that you have to pick up, very easy levels start with one key.<br />\r\nEasy levels are less time consuming, the more keys to find in a level the more time it takes to finish.<br />\r\nYou are alone. There is no one else, it's a single player game.<br />\r\nThe ambiance in the game is calm and relaxing &quot;check the music in the video&quot;, with a pleasant and modern indoor architecture style.<br />\r\nAs the name indicates you should play the levels many times to get better lower times, it's a race but in a walking simulator mode.<br />\r\nJust find the keys and the exit. Good luck!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n*Update August 2023 - Added audio sound fx",
