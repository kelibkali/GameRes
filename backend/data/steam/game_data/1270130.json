Jump into your tractormech, swap that <strong>vacuum harvester</strong> out for a <strong>darksteel pummeler</strong> and get a-whacking! First person shooter, hack’n’slash, battlefield commander - <strong>combat is what you want it to be</strong>!</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > <u>Die</u> - Does the night not pose enough danger? Make it harder. <strong>Lure the horrors</strong> of the deepest chasms, the named things of the Very Dark, up to your farm and slay them for their shiny baubles! All it takes is a <strong>carefully performed ritual</strong> and a <strong>whole lot of blood</strong>.</p></li></ul>",
