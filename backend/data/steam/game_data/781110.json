The main goal was to tell a story about &quot;getting out&quot; of a situation which makes you feel like &quot;you are stuck&quot;. After countless brainstorming sessions, we decided that &quot;a change of self&quot; is needed in order the change the setting. With that in mind, my best friend and I started to make this game.
