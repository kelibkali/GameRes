    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >In this virtual reality adventure, you'll explore the inner workings of a canola plant from root to flower. What does canola need to thrive optimally? Learn about the processes in plant cells, playfully help it grow, and become an excellent plant scientist.</h2><br><strong>LEARNING CAN TAKE PLACE ANYWHERE AND AT ANY TIME</strong><br>Together with plant researchers:inside the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research, Breakpoint One and Simmation have created a high-quality educational experience. VR Plant Journey &quot;Die Reise in die Pflanze&quot; teaches children biological knowledge in a playful way. Thanks to fully immersive virtual reality (VR), players:inside are completely immersed in the inner workings of a canola plant, experience the events up close and can even control them.<br><br><strong>EDUTAINMENT MEANS ENTERTAINING LEARNING</strong><br>In three chapters - root, leaf and seed - you test out how an optimum of nutrients must be regulated for the development of plant organs. <br>The unusual learning unit is lightened up by playful elements. <br>In the leaf, for example, chloroplasts are thrown with the basic substances of photosynthesis, carbon dioxide and water; in the root, ammonium and nitrate, important plant nutrients, have to be assembled; and in the seed, oil bodies have to be hit with a bow and arrow so that they grow. <br><br><strong>The high-quality implementation of the concept is reflected in several internationally renowned awards and nominations:</strong><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Awards</h2></strong><br>As part of the science and research project AVATARS<br><strong>2021 for the VRnow Award &quot;Best Industry VR&quot;</strong> <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1487650/extras/a2cd8e56b12eccc65d860353e063793b.avif?t=1628582017\" width=500 height=375 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Award nominations</strong></h2><strong>2021 for the VR Awards &quot;VR Education and Training of the Year&quot;</strong>  <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1487650/extras/3075a1946f55a09c149dc508d5abf459.avif?t=1628582017\" width=500 height=281 /></span><br>2020 for the Auggie Award &quot;Biggest Societal Impact&quot;<br>2020 for the Laval Virtual Award in the category: &quot;VR/AR for Learning and Training&quot;<br>2019 for the VRnow Award &quot;Best Learning Solution&quot;<br><br>Follow us on Facebook and never miss news, discounts and promotions.",
