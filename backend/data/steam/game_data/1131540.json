    "description": "My Light In The Dark is a short story about a girl who lives with her abusive mother. The girl finds out some dark secrets about her mother, and she has to find a way to escape the house.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the game, the player has to search for clues and keys to advance the story. You can find objects that will appear in the slots on the bottom of the screen, and when used correctly they will turn grey. Important objects are marked with color throughout the maps. Controls are easiest with a keyboard, or with a mouse if you prefer. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game was made within 2 weeks as a submission to IGMC 2017, ranked #15 on Judge's Choice, and #17 on People's Choice out of 223 entries. After the contest, the game was updated with some changes to the ending and dialogue. This is a simple representation of what I can do in a short time from start to finish.",
