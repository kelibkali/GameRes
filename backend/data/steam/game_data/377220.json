    "description": "You are the manager of a colony of people trying to survive after nearly exhausting their resources. You do this by choosing when to launch your ships out into the depths of space. Your impatient colonists move ships into orbit every few days, and it is your duty to ensure that you time your launches appropriately to land on a target planet. Be aware though, gravity is a major burden in space travel. <br><br><strong>Your goal is to survive in this universe for as long as you can. </strong>",
