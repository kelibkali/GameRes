There isn't Permadeath in the traditional Rogue sense. Instead, if you crash or don't go fast enough, you'll restart the same chapter but the level will be completely random within the same road and world characteristics. So you can't memorize a track, and instead have to rely purely on skill and technique... and maybe a little bit of luck.<br><br>You'll need to maintain your speed <i>and</i> your wits or you'll never make it...<br>But make it where?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >It's light versus dark. <br>It's risk versus reward. <br>It's life or death. <br>Whatever happens, you have to see the night through</h2>",
