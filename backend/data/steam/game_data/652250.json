    "description": "This pond ain't big enough for the both of us. Two toy boats go in. Only one comes out. Can you time your cannon fire perfectly to defeat your opponent?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Pond Wars two players sit down on a single keyboard. Each player controls a boat, which they can move left and right on a 2D screen. Each boat is equipped with a cannon that is used to fire shots at the opponent ship. Hit your opponent's boat enough times, and their boat will sink to the bottom of the pond, giving you the victory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSounds simple right? The trick is you can't aim your shots directly. Each time a cannon ball hits the water, it will create waves. You have to time your shot perfectly with the bouncing waves in order to hit your opponent. As more cannon balls hit the water, the waves become bigger and bigger, allowing for all sorts of mayhem.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGames are quick matches that last five or so minutes each. Of course if you win, your opponent is going to want to get revenge in a rematch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote this game plays with two players on one keyboard. No single player is available.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n- Two player game play<br />\r\n- Configurable keyboard controls<br />\r\n- Physics based wave system<br />\r\n- Fun and mayhem",
