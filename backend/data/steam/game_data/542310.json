    "description": "Kevin is tired of being in this game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCan you help him escape?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is heavily influenced from games like The Stanley Parable, Thomas was Alone and other story-driven games were choices you make matter. The game is about the comedy, tragedy, and drama in Kevin's escape.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThrough out the whole game, Kevin will constantly talk with you. Banter on choices you make and tell you about his plans. The game also includes a collection of gadgets with a unique twist to them - to break the game's boundaries. But the question still remains, is it even possible to escape?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is the introduction to a longer and larger game.<br />\r\nFollow the development on twitter!<br />\r\n@FredholmSimon",
