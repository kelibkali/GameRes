    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Character-action set in ancient Swiss Gaul</h2><br>Around a hundred years BC, all of Gaul is far from Roman control. In the lands controlled by the Helvetii, a Roman legion was subjugated by young warchief Divico, blessed by an ancient boon brought to him from parts unknown. <br><br>However, this victory came at a great cost, as soon the result of the war chief's pact would turn into a curse; an ever spreading rot crawling through his land, and slowly corrupting his mind and heart. Monsters and cultists start appearing throughout the land, and a shadowy figure makes his move, taking advantage of the chaos he helped create.<br><br>With the help of the trusted yet reclusive druid Nammeios and the curious half-beast Renart, Divico sets his journey to undo the source of the rot and restore what was lost inside him. Through his own martial prowess and powers conferred by the old gods, the fight ahead promises to be intense.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1094590/extras/54542b2cd6bf8d9612d798682af9d928.poster.avif?t=1749476933\" width=614 height=150 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1094590/extras/54542b2cd6bf8d9612d798682af9d928.webm?t=1749476933\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1094590/extras/54542b2cd6bf8d9612d798682af9d928.mp4?t=1749476933\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >THREE UNIQUE CHARACTERS</h2><br>A disgruntled war chief, a snarky fox or a wise druid.
