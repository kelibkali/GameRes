Its combat takes inspiration from Japanese arcade shooters, but the story and world are structured like an action-RPG. Bosses will put your skills to the test, but you'll only have to defeat each one once.<br><br>In Vacant Kingdom you explore a whimsical yet desolate land and try to uncover the mystery of where its inhabitants went. On the way you'll meet a colourful cast of characters. Like a chef who only knows one recipe, a nefarious wizard who wields the dark power of obtuse riddles, and a robot who is programmed to teach the world about insects.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Why &quot;Prologue&quot;?</h2><strong>Prologue for a Vacant Kingdom</strong> is a slice of a larger game which will eventually be released as <strong>Farewell for a Vacant Kingdom</strong>. You can think of it as a demo designed to gather feedback so that the final game can be as great as possible. However, even though Prologue is a demo, it does contain a lot of content. Most players can expect to spend 2-3 hours completing it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Gamer Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Challenging bullet hell gameplay in a unique action-RPG framework.<br></li><li>Three levels of difficulty to suit beginners and veterans alike.<br></li><li>Explore a haunted resort and uncover its secrets.<br></li><li>Meet a cast of quirky characters.<br></li><li>Created all by one person.</li></ul>",
