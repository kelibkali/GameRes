    "description": "Sense's original soundtrack is a 16 track cinematic experience composed by Andy 'Andi' Han, the composer for other games such as Katawa Shoujo and Synergia. The game features a unique, ethereal sound which combines traditional eastern instrumentation with inspiration from the atmospheres and soundscapes of John Carpenter. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis unique soundtrack features sounds ranging from traditional to electronic to more urgent and horrifying, matching the varied atmospheres and environments found throughout Sense's own world. Much like Sense's fusion of cultures, concepts, traditions, and ideas, this Soundtrack mixes and matches the best of differing genres and places them into a greatly unique musical experience.",
