Deadweight is an arena survival shooter in which you must shoot through waves of countless enemies with the help of well placed turrets and explosive barrels. Test your reflexes AND wits as you push yourself to the edge of your twitch shooting limits.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Focused Combat </h2>Armed with an infinite ammo pistol, focus is directed towards strategic use of turrets and explosives, not scavenging for ammunition or amassing an arsenal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Randomized Arenas</h2>Randomly generated arenas have multiple gates from which enemies may emerge at any time, keeping you on your toes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Dynamic Defense </h2>Creative usage of explosive barrels and automatic turrets stack the odds of survival in your favor depending on how you place them in the arena.",
