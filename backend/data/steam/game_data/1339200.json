    "description": "Dimension Shift is a hardcore game for hardcore gamers. The game constantly shifts between different 2D and 3D views. You have to avoid hitting the obstacles until you reach the end of the level. The game demands all your skill and precision.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game follows the principle 'easy to learn, hard to master'. The controls are simple (use either keyboard or controller, jump and steer left/right). But hitting that jump button at exactly the right time - maybe not so much. Make one mistake, and you have to start over. Don't lose hope if you die a lot. With every try you will get a little better. What seems impossible at first, might not be so impossible after all...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGood luck!",
