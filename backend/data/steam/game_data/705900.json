    "description": "Tombé Drums VR demo is part of The Music Room family of instruments. Combining accurate feel and ultra low latency this kits sound and feel great. In the demo version you have access to a champagne sparkle Gretsch Broadkaster kit. In the full version you can carefully scanned drums and cymbals from Pearl, Ludwig, Sabian, Zildjian, DW and Gretsch.  You can also get comfortable being on stage, in the studio and in a practice room. Play at Cherry Bar, the best rock and roll bar in the world and Bakehouse Studio, a favourite rehearsal room of Elvis Costello, Tool and Nick Cave. The demo has just one of these great venues, Cherry Bar. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTombé Drums support an extensive range of articulations. You can play cross stick hits, rim shots, tip and shank hits on the hi-hat, choke cymbals and it's all velocity sensitive. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe demo isn't time limited or feature limited apart from having less kits and less venues. The perfect next step is the full version of Tombé Drums VR. If you're looking for MIDI output and DAW integration you move up to The Music Room for these features and more.",
