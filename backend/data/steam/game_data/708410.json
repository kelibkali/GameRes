    "description": "This is an early stage demo for the game <strong>VR Racket Ball</strong>. We are trying out a concept to see if people would be interested in playing game like this in VR.<br><br>In the demo, you will be placed in a stadium like environment with an AI (early stage- concept). The aim is to steal the ball from the AI and score a goal against it to earn a point. 1 game lasts for 5 mins. At the end of 5mins, you can see if you managed to beat the AI or not.<br><br>In the future, we are looking at different gaming options for e.g. currently it’s a solo game. We are looking at having 1 to 3 people in each team, Introducing Multi-Player, Trick Shots Modes and so on.<br><br>The controls are:<br><strong>[RIGHT Controller]</strong><br>To hit the ball, simply wave your controller and try to aim it in the direction you wish to hit the ball in.<br><br><strong>[Left Controller]</strong><br>Press the touchpad to move forward and point the controller in the direction you wish to go. Press the trigger button to break.",
