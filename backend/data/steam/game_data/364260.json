    "description": "A fiendish warlock has kidnapped the princess, countless legions of darkness have invaded the kingdom, and you're the only one strong enough to defeat the forces of evil. Fight your way through dungeons littered with dangerous traps, equip your character, learn various skills and spells, defeat hordes of monsters, and save the kingdom from ruin.<br><br>The Warlock’s Citadel is a turn-based game in which the player control a single character. The game features a logical and easy-to-understand character-development system that still allows you to develop your own unique playstyle. The monsters you face, which have various modes of behavior and abilities, will frequently drive you into a corner and force you to think carefully and develop a successful strategy in order to extricate yourself from a difficult situation. Character stats are evenly balanced and influence your playstyle.<br><br>Dungeons are randomly generated each time you start a new game. The level map, items, monsters — every aspect of your in-game surroundings changes, creating the potential for unlimited replay ability. You’ll encounter unique bosses and a horde of tough monsters. In addition to the four base classes, over ten mixed character classes with their own stats and skillsets can be unlocked.
