    "description": "A mixed bag of minigames to rid you of your boredom. Fly a plane, blow some feathers, or become a plumber.<br><br>Firstly, there's the Pipe Plumber minigame where you must guide a donut wand around a snaking path of pipes from one silo to the other without touching any of the pipes or the silos themselves. This game encourages the use of your whole room/play space to solve these puzzles. This active use of the 3 Dimensional space around you truly immerses the player into the strange and chaotic world that is Grottonnia. Do you believe you are dexterous and patient, well try this game and find out.<br><br>Secondly, we have the Paintball game where the goal of the game is to beat the levels as quickly as possible. To complete a level you must hit all of the targets. The challenge is that the targets become increasingly more difficult to hit as you progress through the levels. Some levels require you to time your shots perfectly, others levels have targets that pop in and out of hiding, and others just require some good ol' fashion trigger mashing.<br><br>We are constantly working on improving Grottonnia. We're working on new levels, minigames, cosmetic improvements and so much more. One of the goals we want to achieve with Grottonnia is to create a highly optimized game that can be played on almost any virtual reality system. From VR ready laptops to high end desktops, everyone will be able to enjoy Grottonnia.<br><br>-<strong><i>Thank You</i></strong>-",
