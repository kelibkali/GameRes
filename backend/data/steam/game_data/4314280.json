    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>NOT AVAILABLE IN ENGLISH YET!</strong> </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > <strong>For the moment, the game server is located in France, so countries that are geographically distant may experience higher latency.</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Only the following countries are currently open: France, Belgium, Switzerland, Andorra, Monaco, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Greece, Canada, and the United States.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Please hang tight a little longer… :) </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>FAEHNOR ONLINE IN A FEW WORDS</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This game was born from an <strong>unreasonable idea</strong>: creating a <strong>homemade MMORPG</strong>, without a big studio or a real budget — just <strong>stubborn passion</strong> and the desire to offer an adventure that <strong>truly feels handcrafted.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >In this open world, <strong>exploration isn’t guided</strong> by an omnipresent mini‑map or a <strong>magic navigation system</strong>. Study paper maps and learn to find your way <strong>like a real adventurer.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i><strong>Getting lost is part of the journey —</strong> finding your way back always <strong>carries a small taste of victory.</strong></i></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >⚔️ A WORLD SHAPED FOR REFLEXES</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Here, <strong>monsters don’t drag their feet:</strong> they rush, bite, strike, and never wait for their turn.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Attacks are fast,</strong> direct, and without warning. Every encounter forces you to decide in a second — dodge, strike, flee.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: right\">  <i><strong>“Hesitation is often the worst option.”</strong></i></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🧭 A WORLD THAT WILL NEVER HOLD YOUR HAND</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Here, <strong>nothing blinks</strong> to tell you where to go!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >No <strong>quest markers</strong>, no icons above NPCs, no arrow to put you back on the right path. If you get lost, <strong>no navigation system will bring you home.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This is a world that lets you <strong>search</strong>, <strong>observe</strong>, ask questions… and sometimes wander in circles. But that’s also what makes every discovery truly yours.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: right\"><strong><i>“Adventure begins where the arrows end.”</i></strong></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🌿 A WORLD WHERE YOU FIT INTO NO BOX</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Here, your progression follows <strong>no prefabricated model.</strong> At each level, you <strong>alone choose</strong> which <strong>direction to take</strong>. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >No imposed class, no predetermined path: only <strong>your choices define who you become.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >And even if the result sometimes feels a little uneven, that’s exactly what makes you unique.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: right\"><strong><i>“Shape your strengths and embrace your weaknesses.”</i></strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Otherwise, you’ll find the <strong>familiar codes of MMORPGs</strong>: combat, quests, crafting, exploration, encounters… but with the singular touch of a world shaped by a single pair of hands.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🚧 3 UPCOMING STEPS</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >🎬<strong>Intro sequence and opening cinematic</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >So you <strong>no longer drop into the world</strong> like you’ve been thrown in at random — your arrival deserves <strong>at least a bit of flair.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >⚔️<strong>Combat gameplay improvements – phase 2 (status effects / control / aggro / buffs)</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Because it’s time for everyone to do something other than <strong>run in circles screaming</strong>. [currently testing]</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >🔧<strong>Switch to UE5</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Because at some point, we have to accept it’s time to <strong>leave prehistory behind.</strong></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >❓ <strong>FAQ.</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>What about English?</i> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The English translation <strong>is well underway</strong> but not fully completed yet. English voice‑over will only be available at a later stage.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>How will the game be financed?</i> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A <strong>premium item shop</strong> (<strong>non pay‑to‑win</strong>) will be available soon. You’ll find cosmetic options and other practical items there.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Tell us more about the team.</i> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This <strong>MMORPG</strong> began in 2019, first developed by two people, before becoming a project fully carried <strong>by a single creator since late 2022</strong>. The world, the systems, the mechanics… everything has been built patiently, line by line, with occasional help from external artists for certain visual elements.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Do I need a third‑party account to play?</i> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Yes. <strong>The game is not yet linked to Steam accounts</strong>. You’ll need to create a separate account on the <strong>game’s official website</strong>. Registration only requires minimal information and <strong>takes just a few seconds.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Do you use AI?</i> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >As of today, <strong>no content</strong> in the game has been <strong>generated using AI.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p>",
