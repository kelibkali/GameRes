    "description": "BEAK SQUADRON is an old-school, 3rd-person flight game -- a personal love letter to 90’s classics from childhood like Star Fox 64 and Star Wars: Rogue Squadron. In BEAK SQUADRON you fly as the Duck pilot, Sky, and carry out of the orders of esteemed tactician, General Sturn. Fly in different ships, over different worlds, through a 15 mission campaign against the Guinea Pig Empire. Hop in the cockpit to experience a universe and characters that are too ridiculous to be believable.<br><br><i>MOUSE AND KEYBOARD NOT SUPPORTED. BEAK SQUADRON is only playable with a controller.</i><br><br>BE WARNED: This game is extremely unforgiving. Be prepared for a challenge.",
