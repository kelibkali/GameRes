    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>LIGHT IS BOTH FRIEND AND FOE</strong></h2>Light is both friend and foe in Hunt ‘n Sneak – a manic party game set in a world where mystical creatures dwell. Threatened by the fearsome Gobblers, the Pixies’ struggle for survival has begun. Will you use your wit to sneak past the Gobblers, or use your cunning to hunt the elusive Pixies?<br><br><br>Players controlling the Pixies must use spatial memory to navigate the maps; all the while anticipating the enemies moves to avoid the clutches of the Gobbler! Fortunately, Pixies are able to emit a Ping, which briefly reveals them by illuminating their surroundings. But be careful, you never know who might be watching, and a Gobbler may soon be hot on your trail! Players controlling the Gobbler must hunt down the Pixies, capturing them all to successfully absorb their power.<br><br>Thrilling chases will soon have you sitting on the edge of your seat.
