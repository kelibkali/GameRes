    "description": "The dark story from the life of cats and people.<br>Who will own the city?<br><br>After one dramatic incident the whole city turned against the cats.<br>In the city cats are now banned. Having cats was punishable by a fine or even a prison. People began to exterminate cats. Someone took the cats out of town, someone killed them. But the cats still returned. <br>People were amazed that the number of cats did not decrease, but they did not stop and continued to get rid of them. But the townspeople didn’t know that cats are vindictive creatures. <br>They do not forgive the offense. <br>And they are coming back for a reason. <br>Cats declared war on people.<br>So who will win? People or cats?<br><br><br>Cats are gradually taking over the city.<br>You need to distribute the cats by missions and choose their options for action during the execution of tasks.<br>Some tasks require correct decisions, some depend on the level of the cat and randomness.<br>The more often a cat goes to tasks, the higher its level and the chances of success.<br>Also, with an increase in the level of the cat, you unlock new parts of its biography.<br>As you progress you will discover new cats and new parts of their stories.<br>The game has several endings and game scenarios.<br>To collect all the cats and all the stories, you will need to finish the game several times.<br><br><i>25 Cats<br>5 Chapters<br>Different stories<br>Difficult decisions</i><br><br><br>Credits:<br>Powered by Godot Engine<br><br>Text, story and translation: Fyokla<br>Graphics by: SLOZNIYmemniyKOTIKisDVETISHISEDIMIOGO<br>Sound effects from:  freesound <br><br>Music:<br>Night on the Docks- Sax - Kevin MacLeod<br>I Knew a Guy - Kevin MacLeod<br>Faster Does It - Kevin MacLeod<br>Backed Vibes Clean - Kevin MacLeod<br>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0<br><br>Even when we fall - Philipp Weigl<br>Harbor - Kai Engel <br>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0",
