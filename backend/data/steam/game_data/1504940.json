    "description": "<strong>Basics:</strong><br><br>We Can Make It is a solo developed third person shooter. There are four game modes: Bounty PVE, Bounty PVP, Elimination, and Battlegrounds. This game focused on competitive play and challenges the player to stay alive in all modes. There are no timers and no closing circles in this game. All damage is final and this is a permadeath game. Once your out of the game you are out for good, you can spectate your friends though!<br><br>This game also focuses on stealth and planning, for instance, when you are shot you begin leaving a blood trail in your path that players can track. You continue losing blood until you either bandage or die. All of your bullet shell casing and magazines remain on the ground for a good duration to allow players to identify your recent location. Players have a drained perk that allows highlighting the magazines, casings, blood, and footprints for a very short duration.<br><br><br><strong>Game modes:</strong><br><br>Bounty PVE: Bounty PVE is a cooperative mode with 3 other players, your goal is to eliminate the high value target as quickly and efficiently as possible. The target is fortified by plentiful AI targets. Bonus XP is rewarded for stealth accomplishment. Collect all dog tags, which is optional, and if you die you are out permanently but can spectate. The more tags you collect the more XP you get for your confirmed kills.<br><br>Bounty PVP: Bounty PVP is a solo game type facing up to 12 players, for now this is a non-dedicated server setup. Plans for releasing dedicated servers for all game modes is in the future. Your goal is to eliminate the high value target, collect the intel, and extract. That being said, this is the objective of the other players as well. Other players can steal the intel from you if they kill you. Upon eliminating other players you collect their dog tags, to grant extra XP for the confirmed kill and any money they received during their session. The bounty target is an AI hostile and is heavily fortified by plentiful other AI targets.<br><br>Elimination: Elimination is essentially Bounty PVP but you and 3 other players are to face off against 34 other players and defend your Intel, Power station, and avoid your teams HVT getting eliminated. This is the only game mode that stealth is really needed to be focused with. Upon eliminating other players you collect their dog tags, to grant extra XP for the confirmed kill It's your team versus the world and if you make it out alive you will be granted plentiful XP for your survival.<br><br>Battlegrounds(Future update): Battlegrounds is a large open map with multiple locations to hunker down and survive the oncoming zombie onslaught. Your main objective is survival and there are 100 other players in the lobby as well doing the same. In the radius of your team you will acquire more and more zombies over time hunting you specifically. Avoid other players as the two team radiuses combine to form 2x the zombie count. Eliminate the other players and free yourself up. There are also side objectives: Hunt, Sabotage, and Intel securing. The Hunt objective is a simple kill your HVT, Sabotaging is intentionally sitting in the other team radius to bring the horde for a certain amount of time. While this is active for you it halves your zombie count and passes it off to the other team. There goal is to find you as quick as possible. Intel securing is straightforward to, just find and collect the documents for free XP. Around the map are randomly generated gun spawns and attachments as necessary. A store can be built by your teams builder that allows transfer of XP, buying equipment, and storing all ammo, guns, attachments, and dog tags into the bank for later use and trade ins. The end of this mode is done by you simply dying. Once your whole team has been eliminated you will return to the main menu with a multiplier of XP based off of your player kill count, your survival time, and objectives completed.<br><br><br><br>All in all, please keep in mind this is a solo developed game and I fully intend to work with all users in applying better game mechanics, removing bad ones, adding new ideas that people enjoy, and generally just communicate as best as possible to make this game enjoyable! -ViciousAfro",
