The Houses will cast their vote: “Aye” or “Nay” based on their personal interest and political stance. At that point, you might decide to influence the vote, spending your House’s finances to corrupt members of the council, or consuming some fo the limited “power” points you are given for the rule of each King.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2069180/extras/226ce21f960388b3e64ebab531b44b5a.poster.avif?t=1677494055\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2069180/extras/226ce21f960388b3e64ebab531b44b5a.webm?t=1677494055\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2069180/extras/226ce21f960388b3e64ebab531b44b5a.mp4?t=1677494055\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Each decision you make has consequences both on your relations with the other Houses and on the Kingdom’s resources, which in turn might result in the King abdicating or being overthrown.

The structure of the kingdom is feudal: the Duchies and the Marks are managed by their ruling Houses, many of which also have their representatives sitting at the Council, a governing body ruling in the name of the King located in Lybra, the capital city of the Kingdom. As the leader of the Council, all social classes will come asking for your help: Merchants, Scholars, the Army, the Cult of the Mother, and of course, the People. It will be your task to drive the choices of the Council and satisfy their requests… but you’ll also have to manage the resources of the Kingdom, and keeping everyone happy won’t be easy.<br><br>Your main interest is obviously to make Ankist prosper; however, you are also trying to increase the power and the prestige of your own family over the others. The campaign spans decades and generations, and you will assume the role of different representatives of your House over the course of the game.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2069180/extras/8f74f0b215e27001a2b5ac42581c802e.poster.avif?t=1677494055\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2069180/extras/8f74f0b215e27001a2b5ac42581c802e.webm?t=1677494055\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2069180/extras/8f74f0b215e27001a2b5ac42581c802e.mp4?t=1677494055\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
