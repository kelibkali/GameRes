    "description": "<strong>Nominal</strong> is a light-sim, puzzle game that puts you in the merciless cockpit of an alternate-history, 1960’s spacecraft. Played either solo, or via asymmetric multiplayer, you must step into the cockpit of the Odyssey, a beautifully delicate and superbly particular piece of machinery, budget parts, and try to survive.<br><br>In the (probable) event of a failure, you or your Mission Control (friends) must turn to the Odyssey’s Ship Operator’s Manual, which details each of the ship’s core and sub-systems, how they’re wired, what they do, and how to troubleshoot any problem. Work against Murphy’s Law to save the ship, the mission, and your life!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1454190/extras/d77026d001313a278bfd6d442670e609.avif?t=1680987152\" width=616 height=64 /></span><br><br>In the mood for an engineering-based, challenging puzzle game? Brave the Odyssey capsule on your own! More into yelling at your friends in a hectic critique of everyone’s crisis communication skills? Play asymmetrically with the Ship Operator’s Manual in the hands of your friends, family, or even frenemies and let the chaos ensue! Nominal was designed from the ground up to be as challenging as you’re up for and played how you want to play it (walkie-talkies &amp; hard-copy printouts are definitely recommended).<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1454190/extras/a087905497bf9eb59597999b875aad84.avif?t=1680987152\" width=616 height=64 /></span><br><br>The Odyssey, while effective, is a delicate spacecraft, and things will go wrong. Each round, a random failure will occur, and you must work to resolve it before the failure is irrecoverable, environmental hazards set in, or the pilot is lost. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1454190/extras/1e01aa7f3ac6ba426d752a6ae9f9153a.avif?t=1680987152\" width=616 height=64 /></span><br><br>Every part of the Odyssey spacecraft has been meticulously thought out: starting with paper, and ending in the game. Every switch, button, and dial belongs to a fully-simulated electrical system that’s part of a larger network of intertwining core and sub-systems.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1454190/extras/8aae9c5c4368b116da1c065420f1651b.avif?t=1680987152\" width=616 height=64 /></span><br><br>Any vehicle, car, boat, plane, or spacecraft has an owner's/operator's manual. The Odyssey spacecraft is no exception. <br><br>Carefully planned, the Odyssey Spacecraft Operator's Manual (available online and in PDF format, allowing it to be loaded on a second monitor, the Steam Overlay, or any mobile device) has been modeled after actual procedures manuals from Apollo-era craft. The Operator's Manual includes detailed diagrams, a bit of humor, and pre-launch, hazard, and emergency procedures, all done in an authentic 60's, government-funded style!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1454190/extras/1f7ba68774d4e701efa27424458f8eef.avif?t=1680987152\" width=616 height=64 /></span><br><br>There are over ten unique possible systems failures to overcome. Each failure has its own unique, detailed set of Emergency Procedures available to fix it.<br><br>Systems failures are inevitable, but getting systems back online isn't the only thing to worry about. In the void of space, there are numerous environmental hazards to be aware of: oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, cabin temperatures. Do you have enough fuel to make it home, even if you do overcome a system failure? You will need to keep all of these things in mind when troubleshooting any particular failure.<br><br>With over 10 unique systems failures, six environmental factors, and the new ‘Modifiers’ feature (27 different settings to increase challenge), that’s over 10*6*27! possible ways to succumb to the unforgiving void of space. And that’s just for single player alone– the variability that comes with playing with friends leads to an endless number of surprises.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1454190/extras/edcd30e420fd04f4feac5b59c83b765f.avif?t=1680987152\" width=616 height=64 /></span><br><br>Nominal is completely developed by a single developer (me) without any ties to publishers or external contractors.
