In pursuit of his dream, he lands in tough circumstances and finds himself facing the threat of total ruin. It would seem that it's over, and there’s no hope. However, fate gives our hero a chance, albeit a very dangerous one, in the form of an “abandoned” oil pipeline. Realizing that he has nothing left to lose, Mikola, without thinking twice, decides to use it and, using various improvised devices, moonshiners style, starts a risky venture that involves him in incredibly amusing, sometimes dangerous and unpredictable adventures.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1122780/extras/cca8a6bf5c3b484a41d8d17f2c128139.poster.avif?t=1646486626\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1122780/extras/cca8a6bf5c3b484a41d8d17f2c128139.webm?t=1646486626\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1122780/extras/cca8a6bf5c3b484a41d8d17f2c128139.mp4?t=1646486626\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><br><br><br><strong>Game Features:</strong><br><br><strong>- </strong>More than 5 hours of relaxing gameplay.<br><br><strong>- </strong>A tragicomic realistic plot divided into acts.<br><br><strong>- </strong>A variety of quests.<br><br><strong>- </strong>Hand-drawn picturesque landscapes in 23 night and day locations.<br><br><strong>- </strong>Over 30 characters.<br><br><strong>- </strong>More than fifty interactive items.<br><br><strong>- </strong>More than a dozen types of vehicles: from a modern bicycle to a steam locomotive.<br><br><strong>- </strong>130 unique animations of the main character.<br><br><strong>- </strong>Multiple movement paths that help to avoid obstacles and perform other maneuvers.<br><br><strong>- </strong>Original atmospheric music recorded with live instruments.<br><br><strong>- </strong>Family Friendly.<br><br><strong>- </strong>Narration: First of all, our beautiful game is a story with a fascinating and rich plot based on novel.
