    "description": "The kickboxing fights are here once again and it's time to prove your <br />\r\nmettle, show them who's boss in this kickboxing title.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon't think that this is just a walk in the park, these guys you're up <br />\r\nagainst are ruthless, fast and worse, they're killers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is going to be one of the roughest of challenges you can come across <br />\r\nand if you can make it here, odds are you'd make it anywhere else.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo watch yourself, be smart, intuitive, reflexive and knock these guys out, <br />\r\nif you can. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRules, only the one rule, knock your opponent out till he can't move again. <br />\r\nNo formal technical knockouts, if you or your opponent don't get up before <br />\r\nthe referee countdown, that's when the match is won or lost. There's no <br />\r\nthree knockouts to define a winner in this title, once you or your opponent <br />\r\ncan get back up, the fight continues.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFighting Spree is designed with minimal hardware requirements allowing it <br />\r\nto run on the lightest of PCs, is ideal for any PC.",
