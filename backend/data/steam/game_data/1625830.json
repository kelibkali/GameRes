    "description": "<strong><i>Brendan Keogh’s Putting Challenge</i></strong> is a relaxing open-world golf game about all the parts other golf videogames cut out. Sounds tedious? It sort of is. <br><br>With up to four players on a single device (or online by using Remote Play), you have complete freedom to explore the massive open-world at your own pace with your friends. Play a round of mini-golf, compete on a full 9 hole course, go for a bike ride or just see who can hit the ball the furthest at the driving range. It’s entirely up to you.<br><br>Originally developed in Pico-8, this labour of love has been painstakingly rebuilt and expanded on to include a larger world and more features, while retaining the original 8-bit retro charm.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625830/extras/196c1f844d1eda69acb9167c5c31f246.avif?t=1726047547\" width=600 height=126 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Massive open-world to explore<br></li><li> Five 9-hole courses including; mini-golf, an extra-large desert course, and secret holes hidden throughout the world<br></li><li> Up to four players local (or online by using Remote Play)<br></li><li> Full controller support<br></li><li> Two players are able to play using a single keyboard<br></li><li> Save your progress for later<br></li><li> Original soundtrack by Dan Golding (Untitled Goose Game, Frog Detective)<br></li><li> 22 Achievements</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Brendan Keogh's Putting Challenge: Luxury Golf Cart</h2>Walking to each hole feeling a bit tedious?
