    "description": "The media is quick to put figures to death tolls in such disasters, and 9.03m tries to remind people of the individuals behind those figures. <br><br>9.03m is set on Baker Beach in San Francisco, where debris from the tsunami has washed ashore in the years following the tsunami. <br><br>To play, you must find the butterflies. <br><br><strong>All royalties</strong> (as of 19/12/2013) are donated to charity. Half of all received Space Budgie royalties go to Aid For Japan (), a charity that helps children who lost their parents in the tsunami. The other half goes to Redr () a charity that helps in disaster scenarios.",
