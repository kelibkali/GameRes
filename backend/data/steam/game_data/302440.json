    "description": "Experience the everyday duties of a roadside assistance team in this realistic mix of simulation and management game. Direct your rescue team from your roadside assistance center. Unlock new regions and try to attract as many new customers as possible through successful and efficient operations. You can also roll up your own sleeves and repair broken down cars in the street. One by one, you’ll unlock new buildings, vehicles, rescue helicopters and technologies. Are you ready to make the roads safer in traffic-heavy urban areas and during the harsh winter months? Let’s find out!<br>\t<br>Whether it’s an empty battery in the freezing cold, a flat tire in the pouring rain or an overheated radiator in the scorching sun – your rescue team helps people in need whatever the time, whatever the weather. Put your training to good use to find and fix problems with cars. Here, service is written with a capital S. An additional check of fluid levels is a given, just like the complimentary road safety check.  This way, every customer can count on receiving the best possible protection for their onward journey.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Manage the varied everyday tasks of a roadside assistance center <br></li><li>Unlock new regions and try to attract as many customers as possible through successful operations<br></li><li>Go hands-on in exciting road missions <br></li><li>Find and fix cars’ problems and contribute to general road safety<br></li><li>All vehicles in the game are based on real-life models<br></li><li>Plan your budget and resources well to ensure sufficient safety, even during the intense winter months<br></li><li>Expand your fleet by unlocking new vehicles, rescue helicopters and technologies<br></li><li>Send your workers on training courses and improve the quality of service <br></li><li>Unlock new regions and rise to the challenges of traffic-heavy urban areas</li></ul>",
