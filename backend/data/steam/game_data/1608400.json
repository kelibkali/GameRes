    "description": "NEW! Generate a paint-by-numbers template including matching colors on your palette from any image you find in the browser or your PC. Painting has never been more accessible! <br><br>It’s time to discover your inner artist! With Vermillion, you get a fully equipped oil painting studio in your home, without any of the mess. Ready for the unrivaled sense of accomplishment from creating your first painting? Learn with your favorite YouTube artists using the built-in web browser, generate paint-by-numbers templates from any image, or even better - learn to paint from (new) friends in multiplayer!<br><br>Up to four people can paint together in the studio. Share palettes, work together on each other's canvas, teach a class, or have an old-fashioned paint night.<br><br>Vermillion features realistic wet-on-wet color mixing, undo, layers, and a wide range of simulated brushes. Developed with the feedback of both traditional and digital artists, you're sure to get the fun of oil painting without any of the frustration. <br><br>Once done, mount your masterpiece in your studio, or easily share it as an image. You can also create a beautifully varnished 3D model export for your VR home.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>FEATURES:</strong></h2><br><strong>Paint by numbers</strong><br><br>You can now generate a paint by numbers template from your own images and any image you find online! Vermillion will generate the outlines, which you can show above or below the paint on the canvas. The palette will be automatically filled with the required colors, between 2 and 20.  You can change how detailed you want the outlines to be. You can isolate outlines to one color at a time, so you can very easily apply the right color in the right area. Painting has never been more accessible!<br><br><strong>Paint in other games</strong><br><br>Ever dreamed of painting the mountains of Skyrim, or your favorite VRChat world? Vermillion can run as a SteamVR overlay, allowing you to paint inside any other VR game!<br><br><strong>Multiplayer</strong><br><br>Paint together with up to three of your friends, or new friends you meet in public rooms. Cross platform with Quest 2. Compatible with the overlay mode, so you can paint together inside other VR games. Note that the overlay only exists within Vermillion - other players not inside your Vermillion multiplayer session can not see your painting equipment.<br><br><strong>Realistic color mixing</strong><br><br>Vermillion allows you to blend colors as you would with real paints. Dip your brush into multiple colors, and mix a new color by whisking the brush on the palette - and yes, yellow and blue make green!<br><br><strong>Integrated web browser with canvas projector</strong><br><br>Never painted before? No problem! The easel has a web browser right next to it, allowing you to paint along with your favorite artists on YouTube for the first time without needing physical equipment, and giving you convenient access to the internet's vast library of learning resources and reference material.<br>Vermillion comes with an hour long in-game paint-along teaching you how to paint a cute robin - you'll hardly believe what you are capable of!<br><br>The browser can even be projected onto the canvas, so you can easily trace your reference. You can also display local images on the browser.<br><br><strong>Mount your paintings</strong><br><br>You can mount your paintings in the virtual studios, so you can enjoy your previous work while painting your next piece.<br><br><strong>Designed for wet-on-wet painting</strong><br><br>Vermillion is made for wet-on-wet painting. It mixes color not only on the palette, but also on the canvas, allowing you to create perfectly smooth gradients with just a few strokes. Use a dry brush to blend colors further, or to move paint around to create a variety of effects from reflections to grass.<br><br><strong>Layers</strong><br><br>While Vermillion is made to be the ultimate wet-on-wet experience, sometimes you just need to paint on another layer for detail work. Which is why it's fortunate that there is support for four separate layers that you can merge and re-order!<br><br><strong>Fine control over every mark</strong><br><br>Exert fine-grained control over your brushwork through the pressure with which you press the brush into the surface. Use the hand steadying tool to compensate for the lack of a physical canvas to rest your hand against.<br><br><strong>Distinct brushes</strong><br><br>From the two inch brush all the way down to the rigger, there's a brush for every occasion.<br><br><strong>Sharable</strong><br><br>You can export your finished painting as a 3D model to use in your VR home, share through Sketchfab, or use in social VR applications. Vermillion also offers up to 8k image export of your finished piece, which can be used for canvas prints! <br><br><strong>Made for streamers</strong><br><br>With a controllable spectator camera to offer great views of the process while streaming or recording, as well as full LIV support, you'll be sure to create amazing content.<br><br>Paintings in the trailer and screenshots by David Kühnel, Chad Munn, Gladski, and Markus Franz.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1608400/extras/ba66869188c7ed87593271e7eb02fb6f.avif?t=1742850195\" width=250 height=251 /></span>",
