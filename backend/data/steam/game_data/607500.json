    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Compass Point #02: Cult of the Iron Mask</strong></h2><strong>A 3.5e mini-adventure site for 4 to 6 Characters Levels 3 to 4</strong><br><i>In the darkness of the middle ages the rights of women folk are often left unguarded by chivalry as men give in to lust, jealousy, or the intricacies of arranged marriages made to foster alliances and cement political power.</i><br><i>The Cult of the Iron Mask is the direct reaction of the women folk of a distant land against the tyranny of wicked men. A secret, militant society of women folk. Who seek vengeance against those who break the vows of chivalry, abusing the sanctity and innocence of woman-hood! While also offering safe sanctuary, and a new life to those seeking to flee unjust treatment at the hands of mans lust.</i><br><i>The average follower maintains a secret pact with the cult, watching society as innocent helpless women. Looking on from the windows of peasant hovels, or listening at keyholes from the kitchens of merchant lords. While acolytes of the Iron Mask  normally women folk who have fled terrible husbands or oppressive slave masters  reside in a secret underground monastery. From where, the cult coordinates contacts with women sympathetic to their cause, or under the guise of the dreaded Women of the Iron Mask, launch raids to free the oppressed and punish the wickedness of men.</i><br><strong>Compass Points</strong> are small adventures sites for 3.5e which can be dropped into an existing campaign as a side-adventure or as a stand alone adventure! Each <strong>Compass Point</strong> includes all of the maps, tokens, and story entries that a Game Master needs to employ the mini-adventure module.<br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included Pathfinder (3.5E compatible) ruleset.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong></strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included Pathfinder RPG and D&amp;D 3.5/ OGL ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
