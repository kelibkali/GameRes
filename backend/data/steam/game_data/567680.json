One of the concepts of this world: “die or have your own exhibit at a big museum” allows a player to experience numerous funny and sometimes weird emotions.<br><br>The game mechanic in The Pasture is totally nontrivial. It may seem very simple, but yet it gives you a whole range of feelings: from hopelessness before the museum staff and famous artists to a vague understanding that it’s the implicit methods in this game that will allow you to “move forward”.<br><br>The game includes more than 30 pieces of contemporary Russian art, so you will have a great opportunity to fill out possible gaps in your education.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Several playable characters.<br></li><li>You can create your own exhibition at a museum.<br></li><li>A possibility of dying more than once.<br></li><li>The real prototypes.
