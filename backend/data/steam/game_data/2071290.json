    "description": "Cityscape Sprint is an Arcade style auto-runner with a charming lo-fi aesthetic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChase high scores and climb leaderboard rankings by mastering a movement system that seems simple on the surface, but has a lot of depth. Use just one button to run, jump, slide and leap over ledges. The key is to preserve your momentum as you fly from collectable to collectable, accumulating points before the timer can run out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe aesthetic of the game is inspired by the little moments in day to day life that bring joy. Run through the vibrant high street on your morning commute, slide into the flashy lab on your way to lectures, and jump atop of the evening bus on your way home.",
