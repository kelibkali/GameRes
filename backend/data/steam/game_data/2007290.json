Ship positioning will matter. <br><br><strong>Familiar present-day weaponry</strong><br>The majority of weaponry available will be familiar to present-day and mountable on turrets with limited firing arcs.<br><br><strong>Warship Customization</strong><br>Customize your ship's weaponry with a range of projectile and missile turrets. Turrets slots have a maximum supported size and fitting the biggest guns in each slot is not an option. Then enhance the abilities of your warship by fitting modules, impacting offensive and defensive ship systems to gain an early advantage over your foes.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2007290/extras/00b46ec14fb2368612284739c0d2db27.poster.avif?t=1728068702\" width=616 height=154 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2007290/extras/00b46ec14fb2368612284739c0d2db27.webm?t=1728068702\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2007290/extras/00b46ec14fb2368612284739c0d2db27.mp4?t=1728068702\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
