The player commands the Swedish army with all regiments that took part historically. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The infantry, cavalry, and artillery of the army deal different amounts of damage to each other. Obstacles such as chevaux de frise protect the defending army from cavalry. Walls and wagons also protect them against artillery and musket fire. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Infantry can, unlike cavalry, walk over any obstacle as long as there aren't any enemies left on the other side. Cavalry can only ride over a few randomly selected obstacles. Infantry can not always melee attack a unit that is protected by wagons. However, they can always fire at these protected units. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Outnumbered units that have suffered heavy losses often surrender. Repeated attacks and encirclements of enemy units are very effective.
