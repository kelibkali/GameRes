    "description": "<strong>The Butterfly Sign: Human Error</strong> is the second chapter of the first person detective video game in which we are playing as a sole survivor of a serious terrorist attack. Protagonist is the only witness of the incident and his fate depends on his memories. That’s why he goes in for a desperate measure: he takes the experimental medication called “Rammex”, which immerses him in the depths of his mind and makes him accurately recollect a chain of events, which had happened. While wandering through his own memories, the protagonist has to look for evidences and learn bits and pieces to find the guilty persons…<br><br><strong>The main feature of the second chapter</strong> of the game is the concept of multilevel memories. Drug effect of Rammex makes the protagonist remember everything he has ever known, while maintaining freedom of action and choice inside his memories. This means that if the protagonist finds the device with Rammex in his memories, then theoretically he may use it…<br><br><strong>The second distinctive feature</strong> of this episode is the spatial confusion inside the memories or, put simply, looped space. Some of the memories will cause errors in memory, thus creating looped space: while trying to leave the location by all means, the protagonist will make it into it again and again and so on ad infinitum. You will have to put your thinking cap on in order to solve this puzzle, to break the loop and to get out.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/555260/extras/d4e74c18f034d7db210654fa22e4b0ee.avif?t=1626908510\" width=594 height=72 /></span><br>Explore Memority hospital and its premises, learn its secrets and restore the chain of events that took place here.

The protagonist, Jack, was found not far from Memority hospital, where an experimental drug called Rammex had been developed. It was created to help patients recover their memories. But the hospital was attacked. The drug was stolen, and all the staff and patients were killed. Explosion and conflagration destroyed a part of the hospital. And Jack was the only survivor. As a result of a strong explosion, Jack lost some of his memory, he remembers only small fragments of what have happened. <br><br>Jack is helped by Dr. Romanov – the chief scientist of Memority hospital and the mastermind behind the drug. During the whole game, the protagonist will be staying in a hospital bed, and all the gameplay will occur in his memories restored with Rammex. The game world is divided into two parts: the real world, where the hero is confined to a hospital bed, and the world of his memories, where he will spend most of his time. <strong>The Butterfly Sign also has non-linear dialogues, and all your decisions will affect the outcome of the story at the very end.</strong><br><br><strong>Necessary Evil</strong><br><i>The Butterfly Sign is divided into three chapters.

He goes to the dam, where he last saw the mercenaries, but instead finds only one person who jumps down from the dam trying to commit suicide.
