    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Based on cult classic Space Station 13, <strong>Unitystation</strong> is a game centered around life on an outpost exploration ship in the far reaches of space. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The game is full of paranoia and lighthearted shenanigans, being a station that is as much at risk from clowns and mimes as it is from undercover operatives, eldritch cultists, changelings, demons, revolutions, and assaults from enemy corporations. Played in rounds that reset the station every time, the game features an assortment of jobs, including doctors, chemists, scientists, janitors, engineers, atmospheric technicians, security guards, bartenders and the all-important clown. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Each round’s randomly selected antagonists will try and execute plans to fight the station’s crew. Despite some unintuitive graphics and mechanics, the game can be incredibly addictive! Endless possibilities await you on the barely airtight deathtrap that is <strong>Unitystation</strong>... </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Player-driven gameplay</strong> - Every round plays out differently. Almost anything on the station can be picked up, examined or vandalized.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Slapstick Simulation</strong> - Fly a shuttle into the station, breaching the hull and venting everyone into space.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Dozens of jobs</strong> - Want to play a cook? A janitor? Law enforcement? Or maybe the captain? Even lawyers have a place on the outpost.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Finally Remade</strong> - No more dealing with BYOND to play your favorite spessman game. </p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p>",
