    "description": "Oneons is a short minimal, coffee-break roguelike with 12 floors of tactical combat, dangerous enemies, and useful items. Strategize your limited health and energy and strategically use items as you descend through the increasingly difficult floors. Survive. Die. Fight again.<br><br>After years of imprisonment and experimentation in a Sentinel prison, an Oneon shatters its containment pod and begins the long road to escape. Can it evade the sentinels and their minions, and rescue its fellow Oneons along the way?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1342600/extras/186c1d90d624d0bf49530865d58b34fd.poster.avif?t=1737597325\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1342600/extras/186c1d90d624d0bf49530865d58b34fd.webm?t=1737597325\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1342600/extras/186c1d90d624d0bf49530865d58b34fd.mp4?t=1737597325\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1342600/extras/806d4efd75baa07c161e75f0da2464f4.avif?t=1737597325\" width=600 height=124 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Navigate through twelve floors filled with unique and dangerous enemies, some with powers of their own.<br></li><li>Balance careful use of combat, energy, and your unique abilities to maximize your chances of survival<br></li><li>Free other Oneons to power up in your quest for freedom<br></li><li>Permanent upgrades make it easy to win, eventually, with minimal grinding<br></li><li>Discover a story about oppression, faith, and hope</li></ul><br>Note that Oneons is designed to be quite difficult.
