Except for the fact that the raccoon talks and Sandra's friends include an artistically-inclined pyromaniac and a Burmese freedom fighter named after a video game character. But apart from that? Perfectly normal. <br>But then, one fateful night a mysterious computer virus sucks them both into a cursed adventure game! One that will raise your hackles and make your fur stand on end as you and they have never experienced before! <br>Dragons circle the skies above, a castle is under siege – this virtual world is a very dangerous place to be, indeed.
