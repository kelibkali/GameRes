    "description": "The Blue Zula Concert Series is a fully immersive listening experience that is only possible in virtual reality. While travelling through the environment you change the mix in your headphones. Each track was recorded with over 20 microphones positioned in an array and placed in their virtual equivalent location to replicate real room acoustics. <br />\r\nMusician/Solo developer's debut.<br />\r\nRecorded in Vancouver's finest facilities. <br />\r\nAll the musicians were scanned and motion captured while playing the recorded tracks. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeing a musician I wanted to explore new ways of immersing audiences in music and to use the latest technologies to enhance the listening experience.<br />\r\nSo this is what I came up with. A live show set in a virtual space with an old school arcade next door for extra hangout space.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI intend to add more arcade machines and more tracks in future updates as well as multiplayer support and animation improvements.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Acknowledgements<br />\r\nA Big Thank You to Creative BC Music Innovation Fund!<br />\r\nI couldn't have done it without the amazing string arrangement of Donovan Seidle and the performance of both Donovan and Janna Sailor on violins and viola.<br />\r\nI composed all the music and performed the vocals and the piano.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso without Epic - Unreal Engine 4 this would not exist and would definitely not look as good.<br />\r\nAs the only programmer I couldn't have done it without the amazing assets from the Unreal Marketplace.<br />\r\nI've used them and I'm very grateful because they really pushed this production forward<br />\r\nChameleon Post Processing<br />\r\nBird band<br />\r\nVictorian dining room<br />\r\nOld town<br />\r\nFantasy dungeon<br />\r\nBowling pool and darts pub games<br />\r\nAdvanced glass shader<br />\r\nVR Integrator <br />\r\nHands VR<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI also want to thank Blender and the Blender Foundation and Blender Marketplace in specific<br />\r\nRetopflow and Autorig Pro",
