Or a short narrative story with platforming elements.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >History</h2><br>An unexpected natural cataclysm, somewhere in the wilderness, disturbed the peace of the peacefully deceased hero. And as it turned out, in the depths of a nearby plot of land, mining work was carried out. Actually, he fell into these mines. Unfortunately, not all of the miners managed to evacuate quickly and ... In general, it is regrettable that the number of deceased (but not peaceful now) became a little more.<br><br>Now there is no choice but to find a way back up and return to your last refuge.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Briefly about the gameplay</h2><br>A small adventure that simulates walking on eight platforms.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Demo limitation</h2><br>Only first level is available",
