    "description": "Guess what, you incarnate a dude that is expert at solving procedural mazes into an infinite procedural land. Not only you have infinite stamina and run like a horse, but you also have incredible gymnastic skills. Run and jump you way 'till the end of the maze to access the next level. Watch out since levels are getting bigger and bigger. Oh and another detail, you have no map. You have to remember where you are coming from if you don't want to run for hours and lose your mind into these mazes. A last tip : in case you are stuck at some level, just start it over, a new one with the same dimension level specs will be created.",
