    "description": "“The Lady” is an emotional 2D Surreal Puzzle Horror adventure. <br><br>The Lady is a surrealist emotional journey that takes The Lady through a series of fever dream hallucinations, while being at odds with inner struggles of anxiety and depression. She encounters multiple versions of herself throughout the game, unsure of which versions to trust. From the initial confusion, to all out anxiety that one would experience with panic disorder, it's all there for you to explore first hand through the eyes of The Lady.<br><br>The Gameplay Mechanics are inspired by classic SNES and Turbo Grafx16 type games. The gameplay difficulty is brutal, just like life itself. <br><br>The game is displayed in a “waist up” cinematic style, for a more personal experience. Gameplay features side-scrolling exploration, puzzle solving, retro arcade-style boss battles, and plays in letterbox full screen HD.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><strong><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The most unique Female Protagonist to ever appear in a video game<br></li><li>Five unique levels each with their own play style<br></li><li>Retro difficulty <br></li><li>No tutorials, no hand holding<br></li><li>Puzzle exploration<br></li><li>A story that will make you ask questions about &quot;The Lady&quot; and about yourself</li></ul></strong>",
