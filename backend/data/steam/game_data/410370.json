I, <strong>Huenison</strong>, the Evil Master in charge of the conquest of your world, will see to it that you fail miserably.<br>Yes, conquest.<br>Why? Because.<br>Unfair? Who cares. But enough, I am not wasting further time here. Go away. Or, if you're really serious about it, come down into my deep Mind Control Wells and... die.</i><br><br><strong>WHAT IS THIS?</strong><br><br><strong>Huenison</strong> is an innovative arcade shooter that takes various elements from <strong>Arkanoid</strong>, <strong>BOH</strong>, <strong>Decathlon</strong>, <strong>Dyna Blaster</strong>, <strong>Impossible Mission</strong>, <strong>Oil's Well</strong>, <strong>Pac-Man</strong>, <strong>Pang</strong>, <strong>Qix</strong>, <strong>Slam Tilt</strong>, <strong>Space Invaders</strong>, <strong>Tetris</strong> and <strong>Vital Light</strong>, and puts them together in a hectic mix. All in retro visuals and synthetic sonorities that recall the revered <strong>Commodore 64</strong>'s <strong>SID</strong> chip.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/410370/extras/57c6f89ccaeaaf5a8b895534adf59e45.avif?t=1659625209\" width=616 height=96 /></span><br><br>You shoot at falling <i>bricks</i> with a <i>cannon</i> at the bottom of a <i>well</i> (and no, you haven't ever seen anything like this before). Your beams hit bricks only when they are of the <i>same color</i>. Hitting a brick produces a <i>specific effect</i> depending on the <i>type of the brick</i>. Missing bricks will let them accumulate at the bottom of the well, raising the <i>ground</i> where the cannon rests - and, on top of that, bringing the <i>deadly zapper</i> down, closer to the cannon.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/410370/extras/febaafd63d31927958320292125d7498.webp?t=1659625209\" width=616 height=63 /></span><br><br>But this is just the beginning: each level plays differently, more and more brick types are introduced along the way, occasional <i>disturbances</i> will suddenly bring some more chaos and lots of <i>bonuses</i> will help catch a breath (and score more points)!<br>It's a unique experience that can't be described with words.

Eventually the Evil Masters were repelled, but, as seen in <strong>QUOD INIT EXIT IIm</strong>, during their retreat, Huenison and his companions happened to pass by planet <strong>Suinio</strong> and decided to cause trouble there as well. In <strong>MAH</strong>, years later, the danger came from the <strong>Apocalypser</strong>, the weapon that had been developed against the Evil Masters and that the <strong>Purifiers</strong> activated to destroy the Earth. Finally, <strong>KOG</strong> assigns a new task to the hero who turned the Apocalypser off.",
