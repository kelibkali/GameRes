Your goal is to collect the six cores scattered across the map and bring them back to the spaceship in the center.<br><br>When you activate the spaceship after getting all the cores, a certain amount of space will appear around it, and you will have to endure attacks within it for a set time to advance to the next level. You can enter and exit the space at will, but the timer will pause when you are outside.<br><br>The enemies in Adventure Mode will get stronger as time passes.
