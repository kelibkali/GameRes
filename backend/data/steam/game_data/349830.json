The Western Weapon Pack is our 21st DLC for PAYDAY 2. Stare down the law with these older than old school weapons that still pack a punch. Automatic fire is for people who can't aim anyway, right?<br><br>Make your bullets count with the Peacemaker .45 Revolver where six bullets is enough to see six helmets fly. For those who need a few bullets more there is the Repeater 1874 Sniper Rifle. The Plainsrider Bow if you need no bullets at all. An arrow kills and doesn't make a sound.  Unless you attach a pack of dynamite to it, which you can. The dynamite also comes as a throwable so you don't need to go through the potential hassle of having a bow. Ride off into the sunset with four new masks, patterns and achievements. Giddy up!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/349830/extras/1245f7cfc75965efd0f4aa302c924e98.avif?t=1756113495\" width=628 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>Plainsrider Bow</strong> – Iron firearms may have ultimately won the West, but the Osage flatbow was dominant for over a thousand years.
