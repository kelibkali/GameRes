    "description": "This is a puzzle game where you (the green node) have to go around the screen and hit switches that are color coded to the different hacker lines coming in. The game starts simple enough, but quickly gets really complicated as more mechanics are added every 5 or so levels. Mechanics (powers, hazards, etc.) never go away. When they are introduced, they will stay for the rest of the game. Get ready for one of the most challenging puzzle games you'll ever play!",
