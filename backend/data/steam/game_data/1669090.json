    "description": "MURICA is a Metroidvania style 2D platformer taking place in an alternate version of the United States 2000 years in the future. The story is best described as 'Idiocracy' meets 'Chrono Trigger' on 'some sort of drugs'. A little sci-fi multiverse thing that doesn't take itself too seriously, but doesn't plunge into the depths of absurdity either. Well, it may dip down there a time or two, but nothing too crazy. You know, just for a second or two.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe did our best to include content that will give the player a sense of the world we're creating and the story we're telling, and hope you'll excuse some of the unfinished aspects of MURICA that present themselves in the demo.",
