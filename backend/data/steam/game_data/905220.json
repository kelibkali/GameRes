    "description": "<strong>OMG, look at the Earth ... it's Grim!</strong><br><br>Grim Earth is a 2D platform game inspired by SNES/Amiga era gameplay, with a blend of action, exploration and puzzle solving. It features hand drawn art, a dry sense of humour and is free of bloody gore ... although there are plenty of explosions, alien splats and flying robot parts!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/905220/extras/4c08fed206c28f05fb2e9d2f5f230aa0.avif?t=1703976399\" width=610 height=140 /></span><br><br>5000 years from now, a series of apocalyptic events have shaped our once beautiful home into an entirely different world. It's not all bad news though. Countless alien invasions have made it a vibrant place to live and biodiversity is at an all time high, although most of it is not too friendly and should be avoided.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/905220/extras/e8a6444ede2eea6a83c4255ba41bc1d3.avif?t=1703976399\" width=610 height=140 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Featuring hand-drawn art and keyboard-typed code, created over five years by a single developer ... help!<br></li><li>Master the Upgrade Transport Network to reach new heights, but watch out for hacked terminals or you'll pop!<br></li><li>Unlock hidden chests to collect and share reality-altering hexadecimal codes.
