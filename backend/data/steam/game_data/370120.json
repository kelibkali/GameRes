There will be no one else to stand against it.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/370120/extras/39b453c25f6e0e557fe2ecb0d485ea56.avif?t=1699649513\" width=610 height=160 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Chose Your Tactics Wisely</h2>Each fleet is made of ships from four classes, each with unique abilities. Some ships can withstand any attack, some move quickly, and some have great range. Which ships you use will depend on your strategy. Will you hold back and launch a counter attack or will you attack before they have a chance to load their cannons?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Liberate the Islands</h2>The ocean is divided into territories, each of which has islands. As you fight pirates in a territory, you gradually liberate the local islands, which unlocks new locations on each island, new items to buy, and new crew to hire. Just don't spend your gold too quickly.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Complete Missions</h2>As you explore you may find someone who offers you a mission. Completing missions will unlock locations, unlock new ship designs, or reward you with gold. There’s always a primary mission that will move you closer to unraveling the plans of your enemies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Hire Your Crew</h2>Occasionally you will find someone willing to join your crew in exchange for gold or items. As your crew grows you can use more ships in combat or choose to use bigger ships, if you’ve discovered their designs.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Stop to Fish</h2>You can’t fight pirates all the time! Fishing and botany are both available to help you relax while gaining some valuable items to sell. Mythical fish and plants are out there to discover and are worth a lot of gold. Finding them won’t be easy though.",
