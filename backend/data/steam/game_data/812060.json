    "description": "Introducing VIARKANOID, the new virtual reality update of the iconic 80s arcade game Arkanoid. Move the paddle to deflect the ball against a range of shifting obstacles. As with the original game, your goal is to anticipate the path of the ball and control its movement. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut VIARKANOID takes the format to the next level by taking all the elements that made Arkanoid such a classic and re-inventing them for the virtual age. Test your reflexes in interactive game rooms inspired by the worlds of architecture, film and art, featuring mind-bending walls and rotating bricks. Boasting absorbing gameplay and multiple abstract levels, VIARKANOID puts you in the heart of the action for a truly dynamic gaming experience!",
