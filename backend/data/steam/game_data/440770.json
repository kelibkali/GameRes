    "description": "Play as an artist looking at a painted world. You're able to create new items in this world by simply drawing them. Use your own imagination to lead a stickman character through a variety of puzzles by drawing things he can use. There’s always a few ways to solve each puzzle. <br><br><i>Drawn Story</i> is a puzzle/adventure video game about a world painted on a sheet of paper. You control a stickman character living inside this world and an artist with a pencil in hand looking at the paper from above. As a stickman, you can walk, climb, jump and use different items. As an artist, you are able to create new items in this painted world by drawing them. <br><br>Your stickman is always in need for some handy items to have his problems solved. Draw a saw and the character would go cut some wood. Or draw him a whole boat so he would not have to use the saw. Draw an oar and he would get a boat moving. Draw a key to open a locked door. Or draw an axe to crush through this door. There’s always a few ways to deal with an issue. <br><br>In <i>Drawn Story</i> you need to lead the stickman through a variety of puzzles: board ships, make your way past guards, explore castles, save princesses, escape giant eagle nests and so on. Your common sense and imagination will be your best buddies. Little drawing skills are required to create new items. After all, you’re just playing an artist and you don’t have to be a real one. But no one stops you from enjoying your drawing either.",
