    "description": "Project Blueless is a fast multiplayer 2D shooter with quick matches that allow for bullet dodging moves and very competitive games. Join 1-minute matches of up to 10 players equipped with different weapons, grenades, and skins.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDeveloped initially as a tech sample, Blueless is a sample implementation that showcases Photon Quantum, a new networking technology developed by Exit Games.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a demo that showcases the new technology in form of a game freely available to everyone. Blueless started as a sample that we iterated over time, until it became something we cherish and wish share with other people. There are a bunch of other features we'd like to add and one day make this a full fledged game. We'd love to hear your thoughts on it! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame on and have fun.",
