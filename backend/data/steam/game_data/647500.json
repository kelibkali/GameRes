The player has to solve riddles to try to regain his memory while running from dark forces.<br />\r\nNote: The first level will be a little bit difficult! Is a riddle: The pieces of the character's life are the photos, and the angel's scream is the strange sound that you'll hear during the level. Only when there is the sound, the photos will appear!",
