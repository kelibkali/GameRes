Back to wartime, when four rogue raiders went ballistic and did what they could to stop the war and get rich while doing so.<br><br>The RAID: World War II Official Soundtrack contains all the epic tracks from the game in one big bundle.<br><br>Including:<br>The RAID: World War II Official Soundtrack also unlocks the Marching Mace ingame!<br><br><strong>Credits</strong><br><br>The entire soundtrack is composed by Lion game Lion composer Ivan Selak:<br><br><i>Upon composing the soundtrack I finally got a chance to create music that influenced me in my career. I grew up watching the same war movies as my fellow colleagues at Lion game Lion, so the inspiration was already there.<br><br>Doing research and really travelling back to that time was amazing, and I got to work both with majestic horns as well as mellow and melancholy strings.<br><br>It truly has been a great journey. A journey I’m glad I took.<br><br>Ivan Selak, Zagreb 2017</i>",
