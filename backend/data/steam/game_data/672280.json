    "description": "Gates of Horn and Ivory is a psychological 2D puzzle platformer game for PC that offers you one possible theory of our world – of our existence. Have you ever been thinking what happens after death? Or where does the universe end? What is beyond this visible universe? Are we really just bound to 3 dimensions? How does gravity affect time?<br><br>These are the questions we think about every day. And we think that we have some interesting, thought provoking answers to them. Gates of Horn and Ivory will open those questions, and provide you with something to ponder. We think it is a really fascinating thought experiment to turn over the whole worldview and think: “What if…?”.<br><br>Gates of Horn and Ivory offers a spoken story during the players adventure in an outer dimension. There are a few ways the story can be resolved - this meaning <strong>multiple endings</strong>. As a player, you can gather hints about the world around us and increase your knowledge of existence.
