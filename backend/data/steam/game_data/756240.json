    "description": "Asylamba Influence is the new game from RTFM Corp. This game combines aspects of a puzzle-game with a nervous real-time strategy game. It will immerse you in a galaxy shared between several prestigious civilizations on a futuristic and refined interface.<br><br>In Influence, you will lead a civilization and be responsible for its expansion into the galaxy. But there is no point in resorting to violence because the best weapon is the influence of your culture.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Propagating the culture</h2><br>Extend your power by recruiting the most famed men and women of your civilization and send them on missions across the galaxy. Your artists will transcend the beauty of your civilization. Impose your religion: send your priests to spread the one true faith, yours. Your scholars will be an ideal tool to show the rest of the world the knowledge your people hold. Once your traders are on location, buy everything, planet after planet.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Erect to impose</h2><br>Keep conquered systems under control by building grand buildings that reflect your civilization. The Citadel of the Arts, the Manufacture, the Astroport or the Monolith will be welcome havens for your emissaries. Building the Crypt will protect you from outside influences. The Embassy will bring you prestige. And finally, why not dare to build a Dome to defend your faith or a Holotheque to preserve your knowledge.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >No glory without prestige</h2><br>Accumulate prestige and give your empire the opportunity to accomplish great things. Plan the assassination of an opposing emissary, raise funds to support your expansion or trigger a coup to turn the situation around.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Sector by sector</h2><br>Your accomplishments will happen progressively over the course of various planned missions. Many enemies will get in your way and you will have to use various strategies to get out of tricky situations. Sector after sector, take control of the galaxy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Campaigning for victory</h2><br>After earning your stripes as a general of the great Imperial Order, play other characters and factions. Step into the shoes of a great dignitary of the Church of Cardan seeking to emancipate himself from the imperial yoke. Use your technological know-how within the very erudite Province of Aphera. As you wander, you will face the Kovahkarh Swarm, the rich Seldarin League, the Neo Humanist dissidents or the fanatics of the Magotic Cult.",
