    "description": "<strong>PLEASE NOTE:<br><br>In its current technical prototype form, enjoy exploring Knick-Knack Island on foot, by train, by chair lift, or by gondola. Make deliveries, decorate the village, plant trees, make snowmen, explore during day and night, and enjoy a little Christmas spirit! This prototype is an experimental sandbox with a lot of rough edges and we love to hear about what you're enjoying (and what you'd like improved too).<br><br>Thanks and have fun!</strong><br><br><br>Welcome to Knick-Knack Island, the largest island in the Antarctic Bric-a-Brac Islands chain. On the surface, Knick-Knack Island is an isolated, frozen, <br>inhospitable island, but it harbors a secret that makes it very special and is the reason why it’s the perfect place for Santa’s new toy-making outpost. What that secret is, you will have to discover yourself...<br><br>A recent arrival on Knick-Knack Island is the little goblin, Grimbee. He may be a bit strange and ungainly and he may also be a bit over-his-head when it comes to many things, but for reasons yet unclear, Santa has decided that Grimbee must be the one to turn this icy outpost into a thriving, Christmas toy-making operation.<br><br>It’s a huge responsibility and there are a lot of big projects to take care of to grow the operation until it is ready to make toys for all of the nice children of the world. Organizing, managing, and even handson work, will fill much of Grimbee’s day...<br><br>...But it’s also important to remember the little things, like playing a game or drinking hot cocoa with a friend; because it is from the little things, that Christmas Spirit springs.<br><br>So be merry, little goblin! The path ahead is difficult, but with persistence and the help of your eccentric but dedicated crew, you’ll grow this little operation into a magical toy-making wonderland, that brings joy to all the world!",
