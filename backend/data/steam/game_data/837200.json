    "description": "<strong>NETHACK: LEGACY</strong> is a remastered version of the original <i>NetHack</i>, the deeply rich and complex fantasy D&amp;D roguelike. Hack and slash your way through orcs, dragons, and cockatrices as you explore the perilous procedurally-generated dungeons seeking the <i>Amulet of Yendor</i>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About <i>NetHack</i></h2><i>NetHack</i> is an open source, deeply immersive roguelike that has been under development for over three decades. The work of the NetHack DevTeam and hundreds of contributors from over the years have created a deep and highly interactive world, where armor rusts from getting wet, scrolls burn from catching on fire, and bright flashes of light blind you. But the immersion goes both ways: grease your armor so the water rolls off, place your scrolls in a bag to protect them, and shield your eyes with a blindfold! The depth and complexity between game mechanics has given rise to the well-deserved credo: &quot;The DevTeam Thinks of Everything.&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About <i>NetHack: Legacy</i></h2><i>NetHack: Legacy</i> is one of many variants of <i>NetHack</i> and is developed independently from the NetHack DevTeam. The focus of this variant is to highlight and enhance the essence of <i>NetHack</i>, softening the rough edges that built up over the years and enriching the overall experience. Exclusive improvements from <i>NetHack: Legacy</i>:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Custom soundtrack uniquely composed for the dungeons of <i>NetHack</i> adds a powerful atmosphere to your adventures.<br></li><li> Classic ASCII interface with beautiful retro effects lets you experience what it may have been like to play <i>NetHack</i> in its infancy.<br></li><li> Improved interface and mouse support, combined with solid defaults, allows for quicker play out-of-the-box and gentler ease into the complex controls of <i>NetHack</i>, especially for new players.<br></li><li> Built-in replay system lets you relive and learn from past playthroughs, allowing for realtime playback and powerful navigation.<br></li><li> Full instruction manual expanded from the original <i>Guidebook</i> further expands the world and tone of <i>NetHack</i> (without giving away too many spoilers!).<br></li><li> Cross-platform, Steam Cloud saves lets you seamlessly save and continue your adventure across macOS, Linux, and Windows.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/837200/extras/f58315feb84e02b73d577a1a858b439b.avif?t=1542127642\" width=600 height=820 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/837200/extras/7ba460d588e17f4e7beb7183a6c71266.avif?t=1542127642\" width=600 height=820 /></span>",
