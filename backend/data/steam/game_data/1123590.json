A game of strategic combat with a sinister agenda.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Customize and advance your bioroids</h2><br>Male and female bioroids come in three sizes depending on their attributes. Each is custom created with abilities and skills you choose for their tactical advantage and your strategy. Bioroids progress in levels to gain new ability enhancements which you can choose from over 500 options. You can also customize how your bioroids look, including colors, textures, decals, accessories, and much more. <br><br><u>Install the Bioroid Customizer app by clicking the &quot;Download PC Demo&quot; button on the sidebar. Enter the contest with your custom character creations to win a 3D model of your unique bioroid.</u> Now you can also upload your own texture and decal mods for an even more personal appearance. <br><br>Click the &quot;View the manual&quot; button on the sidebar or the highlighted link to access the latest Bioroid User Manual for sample preset character progressions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Everyone finds the right gear</h2><br>Choose from hundreds of ranged and melee weapons, armors, shields, and utility items to match the skills of your bioroids to achieve the ultimate combos! There's also a wide assortment of grenades and mines, loads of add-ons to make every armor and weapon truly unique, as well as cybernetic implants, spycams, mines, detectors, drones, and boosters to make your strategy more colorful. <br><br>Click the &quot;View stats&quot; link on the sidebar or the highlighted link to access the latest Herogrinder Equipment Catalogue for a sample selection of available gear.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1123590/extras/c4ed2d7dde5075669f724a9ac97611af.poster.avif?t=1669897371\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1123590/extras/c4ed2d7dde5075669f724a9ac97611af.webm?t=1669897371\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1123590/extras/c4ed2d7dde5075669f724a9ac97611af.mp4?t=1669897371\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Simultaneous turns with infinite outcomes</h2><br>All players choose their boiroids' actions during the same command phase so you don't have to wait for others to act. Action outcomes depend on numerous conditions like initiative, readied actions, attack/skill/resistance success or failure, awareness, light/arena/character conditions, feats, and much more. The variability of outcomes in each round is almost endless, but success depends on how you take advantage of your bioroids' optimized skillset and the environment to overcome your foes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Rearrange and use the arenas</h2><br>Each arena is meticulously designed with a range of strategic options - doors, switches, covers, cameras, AI drones, lighting panels, and area effects that add to the overall complexity and lethality of the game. All walls, doors, covers an switches are destructible, while covers can also be moved around for strategic positioning.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Design your own arenas</h2><br>Design your own arenas with the Arena Creator Tool and share them with the community. Other players can vote on their favorites, and the most popular ones will have a chance to become official arenas in the game.  <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1123590/extras/9767e405c0b9c7f13b7a4a608e17d195.poster.avif?t=1669897371\" width=600 height=110 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1123590/extras/9767e405c0b9c7f13b7a4a608e17d195.webm?t=1669897371\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1123590/extras/9767e405c0b9c7f13b7a4a608e17d195.mp4?t=1669897371\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Available game modes</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>1v1, 1v1v1:</strong> Command a <u>single bioroid</u>, or a <u>squad of four bioroids</u> against one or two opponents. <br></li><li><strong>2v2 Co-op:</strong> Join a teammate with your <u>squad of four bioroids</u> in a co-op battle against another pair of players. <br></li><li><strong>10-Player Deathmatch:</strong> Enter the arenas with a <u>single bioroid</u> to match your skills against 9 other players, each commanding a single bioroid.<br></li><li><strong>4v4 Co-op:</strong> Join three teammates with a <u>single bioroid</u> to play against another team of four players commanding a single bioroid each. </li></ul> <br>Invite your friends to join any of the available game modes either as opponents or allies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Classified content</h2><br>And there are some things we can't speak about...
