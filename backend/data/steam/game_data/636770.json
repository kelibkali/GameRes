It just so happens that Rivian Varrison, the introverted son of a famous nobleman, is forced to attend this giant event by his father.

But when a sudden and mysterious crime happens on the second day of the celebration, Rivian finds himself thrown into the middle of it, and has to discover the truth behind what really happened -- and who the people around him really are.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>70,000 words -- roughly 7 hours of gameplay<br></li><li>3 BxB romance options<br></li><li>8 endings <br></li><li>25+ CGs<br></li><li>Full English Voice Acting<br></li><li>12+ track OST<br></li><li>PG-13 and R-18 versions<br></li><li>Itch.io AND Steam keys<br></li><li>Windows/Mac/Linux platforms</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About:</h2><br>Chess of Blades is the second <strong><u> Boy's Love (or yaoi) mystery/romance visual novel</u></strong> game developed by Argent Games.
