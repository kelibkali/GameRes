Follow Dynacat on an  adventure to fight back against the robots and protect the land from withering.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay</h2><br>Dynacat is a fast-paced 3D platforming game with an isometric perspective. Speed through stages by using platforms, springs and other stage elements to overcome obstacles. If you're going fast enough you can even run on walls!<br><br>Dynacat's magic tether can attach to many things with a variety of different effects. Use the tether while in the air to quickly dash toward enemies and other targets.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Stages</h2><br>Dynacat traverses three kinds of stages:<br><br>In <strong>Action Stages</strong> the main objective is to reach the goal by traversing an obstacle course. Each action stage has a variety of paths, some are faster, some have secrets and some will let you accomplish secondary objectives such as defeating a number of enemies or getting a certain amount of style points.<br><br>In <strong>Spheron Stages</strong> you must defeat the Spherons, the enemy leaders. Identify their weak points and skillfully traverse obstacles to reach them.<br><br>Unlock <strong>Special Stages</strong> by recovering enough crystals in an action stage. In these stages the goal is to collect a number of energy orbs and reach the goal within a time limit. Complete all the special stages for a special reward! <br><br><strong>Game Modes</strong><br><br>The game has three difficulty modes: <br> <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>On <strong>Normal</strong> difficulty, you can return to previously completed stages at any time. <br></li><li>In <strong>Easy</strong> mode, you can traverse stages without taking damage. <br></li><li>In <strong>Hard</strong> mode, stages are played in order and losing all lives will send you back to the beginning of the game.</li></ul>",
