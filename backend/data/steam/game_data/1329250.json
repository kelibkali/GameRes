    "description": "The Refrigerant Recovery Simulation app has been specially developed by RRA and TAFE to provide an innovative and hands-on way to for apprentices to understand the refrigerant recovery processes for different types of equipment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe processes for recovering refrigerant, pressure testing, evacuating and re-charging systems are critical for both upholding industry best practice and reducing the emission of ozone depleting and high GWP refrigerant gases.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis app allows apprentices to fully understand the recovery process for split system air conditioners and commercial refrigeration systems, using the real world tools that are available to them to undertake work on these systems.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing the app, apprentices select a system and watch a detailed walkthrough before undertaking the process themselves through an interactive experience. By training with this modern-day tool, apprentices have a realistic experience of the process in a setting without the confines of the classroom, access to tools and the freedom to make errors without compromising safety all while reducing the likelihood of accidental emissions of refrigerant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe app boasts an extensive step-by-step guide of all processes with a high level of detail. Apprentices are even asked to select the virtual tools and protective personal equipment required for the process before beginning.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe app also includes a ‘Visualisation’ button, allowing apprentices to see and understand what is happening inside the system. This feature includes visualisations demonstrating gas pressure, speed and direction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe app will soon be expanded to include with vehicle air conditioners, and can be easily modified to include different types of equipment as new technologies emerge through simple updates in the future.",
