    "description": "MidBoss is a possession-based traditional turn-based roguelike with a retro aesthetic reminiscent of the 16-bit era, and the soundtrack compliments this aesthetic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nComposer yuzuki created two versions of many of the game's tracks in order to accommodate the game's dynamic music system; one upbeat and one low-key version. The soundtrack comes with 16 tracks, some with ethnic, tribal, and folk influences, others touching violin pieces or shredding electric guitars.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll tracks are available in FLAC and MP3 formats.",
