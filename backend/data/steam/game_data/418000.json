    "description": "Waking up as Bennet Helms you find yourself in a unknown place, however you do see your family which questions you deeply. <br>You remember almost nothing but you see that something is wrong with this place, and given a choice to either just run or find your family.<br><br>Survive, look for clues and items, hide and try to uncover the mysterious truth of the Visual Corporation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key features:</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Sanity</h2>Sanity <strong>controls you</strong>. It will decide many things, and you can even use it to your <strong>advantage</strong>. But what is it actually?<br>The main character is <strong>Bennet Helms</strong> has a brain tumor on the cerebral part of the brain (The part which controls communication,  feelings, sense of reality, etc.). The tumor however can be contained with <strong>constant taking pills</strong>. <br><br>Now, a few <strong>effects</strong> of the Sanity are:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Makes the player <strong>hallucinate</strong> things.<br></li><li>Spawns critters (&quot;They can, and they will hurt you&quot;, the lower the sanity the more critters will come to hunt you)<br></li><li>Decreased vision field. (Depends on the %(percentage) of the players sanity)<br></li><li>Lowers your mental condition (Highlighting of things will be drastically decreased)<br></li><li><strong>45%</strong> Critters starts start spawning<br></li><li><strong>25%</strong> - Walk/Sprint slower <br></li><li><strong>15%</strong> - Disabling the ability to sprint <br></li><li><strong>10%</strong> - Black/White picture<br></li><li><strong>5%</strong> - &quot;<strong>C-Condition</strong>&quot; - You will be very fast, you will ignore pain of the critters (This means you won't be effected if a critter pushes you, for example but you will receive damage), ability to see far objects, medication will be highlighted.<br></li><li><i>*By hurting yourself you can go down to <strong>15% of your HP</strong> (hitpoints). Every <strong>self-injury</strong> gives the sanity bar 20% sanity.</i></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >WCD</h2>To simplify WCD is the &quot;<strong>brain</strong>&quot; of the Demented world. However it depends entirely on the players <strong>Health</strong> and Sanity (We will get to that in a moment). Now what does WCD do? It:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Changes the world (A wall was there buddy? Well now it isn't.)<br></li><li>Changes the perception of many things<br></li><li>Spawns <strong>Critters</strong> (Critters are the &quot;monsters&quot;)<br></li><li>Adds &quot;corruption&quot; to the world<br></li><li>Plays trick with your mind<br></li><li> System Shutdown (SS) - Changes the power in the facility.<br></li><li>And other</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Radiation</h2><strong>Radiation</strong> is also a strong part of the game, as it can be <strong>rewarding</strong> but can be quite <strong>opposite</strong> as well. Also it can stop the decaying of Sanity but as the Radiation is higher it will hurt you too! Since it is a big part we cannot reveal all of the effects of the radiation.<br>Some <strong>effects</strong> of Radiation are:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Slows</strong>, or stops sanity from decaying. Depends on the percentage of the radiation.<br>Even with little radiation you lose bits of health. It depends on the percentage of the radiation.<br></li><li><strong>40+ REMs</strong> - Occasionally image blurring, and noises in head.<br></li><li><strong>85+REMs</strong> - Walk/Sprint a lot slower, bad reflexes, decreased hearing.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Future Development</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Make the WCD a heavy impact on the game, by changing, adding or removing whole parts of the map.<br></li><li>Add more effects to the Sanity [For instance: heavy blurring, flashbacks of past, etc.]<br></li><li>Add more effects to the Health[For instance: Add a bleed feature, when low on hp, to fall down sometimes]<br></li><li>Improve the A.I - I have a great idea for you and am developing it as we speak! It'll be a lot of fun [By fun I mean in your most immediate death]<br></li><li>Implementing Physic Engine [Ability to drag objects, boxes etc.]<br></li><li>Optimize and polish textures, models and UI<br></li><li>More intractable objects and voice overs for characters<br></li><li>A lot more to come! </li></ul>",
