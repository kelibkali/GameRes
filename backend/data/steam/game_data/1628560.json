    "description": "This is a game based on chicken a real life game that has been around for quite some time and became popular sometime between the 80s and 90s. I want this to be as realistic to the real life game as possible and as such you go against another car toward each other. You play as a car that you can drive on this road where you made a bet with someone else that they will chicken out before you, driving at one another. When the other person chickens out so to speak they turn away from you, in order to not hit you.",
