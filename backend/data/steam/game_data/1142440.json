    "description": "&quot;Thanks for Listening&quot; is a story-driven game that follows the life of four radio hosts as they go about their daily jobs. You as the listener will be provided the unique opportunity to help and influence these four people's lives. So listen closely, find out what they want, and who knows, maybe they will all come out of this better than they could ever think.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story should take roughly thirty minutes to complete but may take multiple playthroughs to discover all possible endings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTotal Donations to the Virginia Crosson Cancer Research Center: $30",
