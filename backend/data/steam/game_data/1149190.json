    "description": "Errant Heart takes place in a fictional 1940's European city (sans Hitler and Nazis) and follows the exploits of a young painter, Lira Moretti. As she leaves home in order to establish herself as an artist in the cosmopolitan mainland city of San Moritz, she has a bizarre encounter with a street urchin which leaves her with a gap in her memory. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs she settles in to life in San Moritz, Lira struggles to choose between starting her painting career or following up on the bizarre circumstances that she encountered upon her arrival. Eventually, after having apparently been followed by the street urchin, Salima draws Lira deeper into an extraordinary world where the passage of time takes on new meaning—a world which runs parallel but utterly unseen to the eyes of the banal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContains partial voice acted dialog, depictions of violence and occasional swearing.",
