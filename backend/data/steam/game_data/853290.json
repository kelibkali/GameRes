    "description": "Claw Breaker is an epic party fighting game full of scoops, snips, and salt. Beware, shouting and excitement may occur in this ultimate two-player claw-down of action-packed slashing and melee attacks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUse a variety of cutting maneuvers while on the offensive -- scoop, snip, and even dirty tricks like the salty taunt. If you’re missing a claw, swap your strategy by collecting all of the starfish for a defensive victory!  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach stage holds different strategic formations offering new and exciting ways to find an advantage. Until you’ve taken both claws from your opponent, anything is possible. Ready, FIGHT!",
