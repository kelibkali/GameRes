    "description": "Jump into gridiron mayhem with M.U.D.S. (Mean Ugly Dirty Sport)! This hilarious and violent top-down action rugby-style game is full of cutthroat gameplay and kooky fantasy characters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLead a team of 13 condemned creatures to victory by any means necessary. Pick a fight, buy or sell players on the market – or bribe the opposing team, the referee or the fish serving as the ball!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWin the game by scoring at least 7 out of 14 goals – or by killing enough of the opposing team. Tackle, pummel or throw players into the moat… but if you get thrown in yourself, get out before the shark-like monster eats you!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a manager, you’ll control the team funds – by booking hotels in the cities you visit, paying for drinks and using bribes to your advantage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a coach, you’ll train your team of misfits to use tactics and fighting moves and throw the other team on their backs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a player, you’ll run, foul, jump, tackle, bite, kick, cheat and do whatever it takes to fight your way through every match.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nM.U.D.S combines all of the best aspects of rugby, RPG character development, management simulation and strategy into an original fantasy sports game that you’ll have trouble putting down. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd remember – the only way to win is to PLAY DIRTY!",
