    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >   Rifts®: The Tomorrow Legion Player's Guide</h2>         A MEGAVERSE GONE MAD!<br><i>   Prepare yourself for a railgun-shredding, mega-powered magic flinging journey into a post-post-apocalyptic world where supernatural horrors vie with technological empires for mastery of the world.</i><br>THIS IS THE WORLD OF RIFTS®<br><i>   Unpredictable holes in the very fabric of space and time open the way to countless creatures, beings, and dangers. Whatever you imagine--whatever you fear--it's somewhere on this war-and-chaos ravaged world.</i><br>THE TOMORROW LEGION IS READY<br><i>   In the battle for survival the Tomorrow Legion brings together the greatest, the bravest, and the craziest to stand against an infinity of threats. They stand for a better future than the past they've known.</i><br>The Rifts® Tomorrow Legion Player's Guide contains everything you need to make and equip mega-powered characters for the Rifts® Earth setting. Iconic Frameworks load you up with options for well-known concepts (Glitter Boys, Juicers, Ley Line Walkers, Mind Melters), as well as the capacity to craft your own custom ideas. New Setting Rules bring home the gonzo, cranked-to-eleven nature of Rifts®, and the gear lists include everything from incredibly powerful weapons and armor to cybernetics to arcana-fueled Techno-Wizard items. New rules for Mega Powers bring magic and psionics to super-powered levels, and Hero's Journey tables flesh out your characters in exciting and fun ways.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Joe Collins</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
