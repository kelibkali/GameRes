    "description": "DESCRIPTION OF THE FULL EARLY ACCESS VERSION<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLinx is currently Early access. More features will be added before full release.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA pure skill based PVP action shooter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLINX BATTLE ARENA takes the online survival game in a new direction with this fast paced, action based Third Person Shooter. Starting with 1 half empty hand gun and limited health, you will always be aware of how vulnerable you are. Play single player training mode, private games v friends or join public open games to dominate the arenas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLinx Battle Arena will be like no other game you have played before - you will constantly be looking and listening for your enemies weak points, ready to exploit them to gain the advantage and pick up that extra coin box from their dead body. You are never secure, never in a position where you know you will survive the next shot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures will include:<br />\r\nSingle Player Training Mode with Ai<br />\r\ncommunity built Arenas (updated weekly - vote for your favourites)<br />\r\nonline weekly leader boards<br />\r\nprivate and public lobbies<br />\r\nSteam achievements<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGAME PLAY<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo teams - every other player is out for their own glory.<br />\r\nSet up or join a lobby and play in timed skirmishes (5, 10 and 15 minutes) or play with up to 5 lives per skirmish.<br />\r\nGames can be set up to have gun vendors where you will buy specific guns with your recovered cash, or have 'lucky dip' gun vendors where you are given a free random gun each time you need a reload.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSelect your character and enter a private lobby with friends or join a public lobby to compete against other players from around the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStart with a single handgun and work your way through a selection of rifles and explosive weapons by collecting cash boxes from around the arena. Having the best gun wont always save you as you only ever have 1 clip and limited health so you will always be very aware of how vulnerable you are. Lives and games are timed and saved on the online scoreboard for bragging rights. Show off your skills with ranked badges and icons shown above your name on player lists and score boards. Weekly winners will enter the LBA hall of fame for all to see on the LBA website.",
