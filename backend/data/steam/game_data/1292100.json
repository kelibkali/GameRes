    "description": "A <strong>unique puzzle</strong>... a huge mad <strong>contraption</strong> to ponder over, made of upcycled things. Slowly and carefully work levers, pull cords, rotate wheels... observe the effects and deliberate, and gradually fathom its workings.  Work-out how to work small parts of the bigger contraption and eventually figure-out how to use it all together to bake a loaf of bread.<br><br>A tricky puzzle, but relax. Half an hour here, 10 minutes there...have a ponder and come back to it, sleep on it.  TraptionBakery is made to amuse, baffle, perplex and interest you for weeks.<br><strong>TOP TIP: move the levers <u>slowly</u>...and adjust your view to see anything the lever moves. </strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1292100/extras/18a732741c34acb8fa24fdeefd03a65a.avif?t=1604503371\" width=612 height=444 /></span><br>When you're not in a puzzle solving mood just zoom-way-in, look around and marvel at all the crazy upcyclepunk things.  This game was a four year labour of love: programming, and drawing hundreds of things for the contraption. Hardly any drawing is there just for show, most of it has a function.<br><br>When you work-out how to bake bread then the <strong>simulation</strong> aspect of the game comes into play: you will be presented with a critique of how good your loaf was and you can improve your technique for better scores.  Could you even become one of the elite few world-wide to achieve a Master Baker's Licence? (See achievements.)<br><br>TraptionBakery can be played full screen, or in a smaller window.<br>(TraptionBakery may work on computers with a slower than specified in the Minimum System Requirements but panning and zooming will be jerky.)",
