    "description": "Overwhelmed by hordes of invading nations – and a series of corrupt kings – the fate of Israel is balanced on a knife’s edge! The Northern Kingdom’s only hope is that a band of prophets can cleanse it of evil and idolatry before the wrath of God does so – permanently. <br><br>Based on the strategic board game of the same name, Kings of Israel takes place in ancient Israel during the reign of its kings up until Israel’s destruction by Assyria. The player must use their team of prophets to fight evil growing within Israel, while trying to build the altars needed to win the game. Life will not be easy for the team of prophets! Each turn evil grows within Israel, idols may be built, and chaos continues every turn a bad king leads Israel. But if the player plans well, and uses their actions and resources carefully, they will prevail and go on to new, and more difficult, battles! <br><br>Here is what some critics are saying about the Kings of Israel board game: <br><br><i>&quot;Kings of Israel is an excellent little game.” </i>-Tom Vasel of  <br><br><i>“A great, solid, cooperative family game…” </i>-“Rahdo Runs Through…” <br><i><br>“We think this game is a total win.” </i><br>-Couple vs Cardboard <br><br>The Kings of Israel video game expands on the board game version of the game by allowing the player to level up the difficulty to the game as they play. For those interested in learning more about this period of time, a Bible Study mode can be enabled to ask questions at the start of each round pertaining to the kings, locations, or events during this period of time in Israel. Finally, detailed statistics of each profile's win/loss record are available to view at any time.",
