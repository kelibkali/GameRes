    "description": "Patterna is a logic puzzle game inspired by <i>HexCells</i>. It features a highly customizable random level generator, a level editor, more than 70 levels, and an enchanting minimalist soundtrack by Alex Cottrell.<br><br>In Patterna, each level is a network of nodes (also known as a <i>graph</i>). In a way similar to HexCells or Minesweeper, each node is ultimately in one of two states (known as <i>pattern</i> and <i>non-pattern</i>). Initially, most nodes' states are unknown. It is the player's task to correctly classify these unrevealed nodes using information based on distance, connectivity, and color. Correctly classifying a node may reveal more information that in turn helps you to solve the level.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> More than 70 levels, plus a tutorial<br></li><li> Procedurally generated levels with plenty of options for the level generator<br></li><li> Enchanting minimalist original soundtrack by Alex Cottrell<br></li><li> Absolutely no guessing needed<br></li><li> Level editor and Steam Workshop support included<br></li><li> Extensive gameplay statistics</li></ul>",
