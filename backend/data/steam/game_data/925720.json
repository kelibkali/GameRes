    "description": "This is the free demo of my next game, &quot;The Pit&quot;, with a release planned for the end of 2018. In the demo is not revealed the history of the game, but in it you can try all the mechanics and the gameplay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou are trapped in a maximum security prison. Fortunately, you are not like the other inmates. Use your powers to manipulate space time at your will. It slows down time and runs longer than the bullets themselves. Open portals to travel to previous places. If you stumble, go back in time and try again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere will be someone who will try to stop you, but your determination will get you through any difficulty. Neither the strongest lock can stop the will<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Pit is a platform game with touches of action and puzzles, which will force you to understand and know how to use all the skills you have.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt The Pit we want to bring the feeling of classic games, taking advantage of new technologies. With a careful style that tries to simulate the feeling that those games gave off.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith this game I try to write a love letter to the games. My passion since my childhood and try to transport it to players, whether young or old school.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe demo of &quot;The Pit&quot; is a build specially created for this purpose, developed in the Beta phase of development, so you can find errors, bugs, that prevent progress, or even the loss of saved data. However, the demo will have periodic updates until the final release, so you can try the improvements and extensions that are made.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for trying this game, if you are interested in the development you can follow it from our social networks.",
