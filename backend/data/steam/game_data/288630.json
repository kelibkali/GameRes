    "description": "<strong>Journalist-turned-food critic Taryn Sharpe and her assistant/photographer George Haske are sent on assignment to France to cover the opening of Paris' hottest new restaurant, Le Roi Soleil.</strong> When they get there, they discover the restaurant's celebrity chef is dead and the circumstances are suspicious. Strangely, the police rule the death a suicide and refuse to investigate. The restaurant's owner (an old friend of Taryn's) is convinced his star chef was murdered and begs her and George to find the culprit.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Follow the clues and solve the death of French celebrity chef \t<br></li><li>Explore many unique locations in Paris and nearby rural surroundings\t<br></li><li>Enjoy more than dozen beautiful Hidden Object scenes\t<br></li><li>Solve many  puzzling minigames\t<br></li><li>Meet 11 lifelike characters</li></ul><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/288630/extras/27ec8b7566b3c67759fc6422f1cda81f.avif?t=1529672507\" width=300 height=500 /></span>",
