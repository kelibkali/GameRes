What equipment do you think is most optimal for each character based on their strengths and weaknesses? <br>When in combat, the player will decide what action each character would take. When all actions have been decided, the turn will begin - along with the enemy's.<br>Some skills have a charge time, meaning that the character who is charging the skill cannot take any actions while they are charging the skill during their turn, and must wait for it to finish to execute the skill.<br>Furthermore, some skills have a cooldown - meaning they will have to be used strategically. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/761280/extras/95ac28e72c91582ba5b83ebccc72d69d.avif?t=1605779587\" width=640 height=480 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay - Field</h2><br>Players may interact with objects in the field, outside of combat.<br>Most of the time, interaction with these objects is crucial to progression within the game - such as solving a puzzle.<br>Also, there are lore books around the world of Ottrea which can be found and read by the player. These lore books detail more about the mythology and history of Ottrea - but aren't necessary to read as the main story will cover more than enough.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/761280/extras/39129a8ecaeaafefd7bfca923c9857c2.avif?t=1605779587\" width=640 height=482 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay - Content</h2><br>Besides from the main quest, there are also numerous sidequests you can complete - and areas to unlock and find. Doing this additional content will reap great rewards!<br><br>There is also crafting within the game, which is unlocked once the first chapter is complete. You can make entirely new gear, or reinforce gear which you already own. You do all this by using materials, with certain ones being dropped by enemies and materials such as leather or cloth available at shops.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/761280/extras/cd8bd70d6a83187b801f967084fc2ccc.avif?t=1605779587\" width=640 height=480 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Additional Features and Systems</h2><strong>Combat Log</strong><br>View the situation of combat at any time by looking at what has occurred during battle.<br>However, active debuffs and buffs, as well as health and MP, are always displayed on the combat UI without the need to access the battle log.<br>Use this feature to see what exactly has occured in order to fine-tune your strategy. <br><br><strong>No Unexpected Points of No Return</strong><br>Because White Pearl is a very story-focused game, there are many points where the open world will be stripped away from you for a time, or certain areas might not be accessed later on. Thankfully, the game will notify you when this is about to happen and you can choose to proceed through the story. You can also view the recommended level you should be at that point.<br><br>[/b]Linear and Unique Progression[/b]<br>All main characters gain a unique skillset gradually by levelling up, but some skills are shared. Stat progression is advanced in a linear and set path - for example, a character's MP may only increase by a small amount by each level. The frequency of each stat can be checked on &quot;Character Overviews&quot;, an in-game item.<br>In addition, sometimes characters gain new skills as the story develops and their character progresses, too.",
