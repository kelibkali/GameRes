    "description": "Anciently the city was known for its artisans and cunning traders. The rumors about its undercroft wealth amazed even the men of great intellect, but wizards’ mastery dampens the ardor even of the most dashing adventures. <br />\r\n    Recently, an unexpected thing has happened… the last caravan returned with an incredible news: an unknown force destroyed the city; some of the inhabitants scattered in all directions, some of them hid themselves in the dungeons. The rest of the City Council members promise a worthy tribute for those who will be able to find the stamp lost during the turmoil. <br />\r\n    Many inhabitants wishing to get the tribute came back to the city. Only the time will show whether the main character will find the riches or he is fated to decorate one of the undercroft corners with his skeleton.",
