    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Possession is a turn-based traditional roguelike where you play as a ghost trying to make your way to the surface. You are incredibly frail, but have one advantage: you can possess the bodies of the monsters you encounter, and use their strength and abilities as your own. Hop from body to body as you attempt to make it back to the surface.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/629340/extras/5c9798c6ec135bdca0742c29f13ac836.webp?t=1736774963\" width=32 height=32 /></span> Dozens of possessable monsters, from the horrifying to the hilarious, with a wide variety of powers.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/629340/extras/c69e44f8ea5763b204e96da34e53d970.webp?t=1736774963\" width=32 height=32 /></span> Special themed levels with unique hazards, creatures and layouts.
