    "description": "Spritify is a tool for the fast and easy generation of 2D sprites.  <br>It transforms simple input images consisting of smart pixels into many distinct output images with varying properties, such as gradient, noise and color which can then be exported and used in your projects.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Demo version</h2>There's a demo version of Spritify that you can get for free to evaluate it.  <br>In the demo some of the import and export functions are disabled.  <br>Also many of the sizes and factors are greatly limited (Palette, Canvas, Sprite counts, Scaling factors, ...).  <br>All other features are available.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Guide</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Quick overview</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Hotkeys</h2>Note that several functions can also be performed via hotkeys. Hover your cursor over functions to see if there's a hotkey mapped to it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Canvas</h2>On the canvas you can draw your input image which is then used to generate your sprites.  <br>The canvas displays both the <i>color</i> and <i>behavior</i> of individual pixels.  <br>The <i>color</i> is displayed as a pixel's color, the <i>behavior</i> as a character (More under <i>Brushes</i>).  <br>You can left click to draw single pixels, drag while holding the left mouse button to draw a path or right click to flood fill.  <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1595360/extras/521ee8501f36df42f641f79b62168e93.avif?t=1618156356\" width=152 height=150 /></span><br>By default the canvas is filled with the <i>Background</i> color and <i>N</i>one behavior<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1595360/extras/d1268561fb2953f1ba23e97cc6445f7c.avif?t=1618156356\" width=152 height=150 /></span><br>When hovering with your cursor, the currently active brush will be displayed  <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1595360/extras/15299d8e4b8a06b1bf709b26fcca2a96.avif?t=1618156356\" width=150 height=150 /></span><br>The canvas after drawing several pixels<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Preview</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1595360/extras/6ede9172865efcc71e6c29482d355933.avif?t=1618156356\" width=800 height=536 /></span><br>Below the canvas there's a preview of the sprite.  <br>It will display the same result you'd receive by performing an export.  <br>Please note that the preview's pixels are scaled to always use all available space, your exported result will likely have smaller pixels.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Sidebar</h2>The sidebar contains all of Spritify's settings and controls.
