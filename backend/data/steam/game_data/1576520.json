    "description": "The composer for The ER: Patient Typhon, Birgit Løkke is an experimental artist, which you can experience on this double-sided album. For example, one of the scariest songs on the album consists of recordings she has made of bees, which she has then manipulated into an unrecognizable, gloomy piece of music.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSide A mainly contains new versions of the music from the game that she made especially for this soundtrack. She did this after she finished the music for the game, but some of it was so exciting that it ended up being included in the game itself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSide B contains mainly the music made for and used in the game.",
