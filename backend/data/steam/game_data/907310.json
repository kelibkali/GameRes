Bring back the glory of the ancient Gods or become a God yourself.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >KEY FEATURES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Brand New Battle System</strong><br>    In World of Myths, units do not attack each other. Instead, they attack and defend as a group. Oh, and the best part - instead of health points, they have Endurance, representing the number of battles they can participate in.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/907310/extras/e07399f46c31359f4a22c5418130bb71.poster.avif?t=1582557353\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/907310/extras/e07399f46c31359f4a22c5418130bb71.webm?t=1582557353\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/907310/extras/e07399f46c31359f4a22c5418130bb71.mp4?t=1582557353\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br></li><li> <strong>Hand in Hand with the Gods</strong><br>    Build your deck and choose a leader to guide you to victory!
