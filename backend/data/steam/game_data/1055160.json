    "description": "Where I am? How did I get here? And how can I get out of here?<br />\r\nHere are three basic questions that a player must answer in order to escape from a strange, mysterious and frightening place. The game with attractive pixel graphics is made in the style of Japanese horror RPGs. The player will have to solve riddles, avoid traps, try not to go crazy and make sure that the flashlight has a spare battery. Just a player expects a fascinating story, the need to make a choice, as a result of which the game will have one of the three endings.",
