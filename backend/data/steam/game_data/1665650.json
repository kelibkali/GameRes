You can mine ores out of mines then sell it, you can do jobs by cleaning up junk and haul or sell it. Or grind it and haul it in the dump truck. Haul logs and skid them.  Will be adding way more things to do over time.<br />\r\nWill add cutting trees later but not in game. You can haul other trucks and things around.",
