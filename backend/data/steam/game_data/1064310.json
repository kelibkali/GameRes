However, the clock is ticking - and the city carries on, with or without you.<br><br>Speak to everyone from eerie politicians to chain-smoking child anarchists. Work as a trader, socialise, explore the town freely, and play a role in the city’s hierarchy.<br><br>Combining the exquisite narrative depth and exploration of Sunless Sea with the curious setup of Majora’s Mask  - plus a dash of Lovecraft - A Place for the Unwilling is a rich narrative experience where player choices really do count, set in a Dickensian world of colour and Eldritch nightmares.<br><br>The city is hungry.
