Gather resources to fuel an interstellar ship as your on-board A.I. Gemini guides you through sunken ruins and ocean depths while listening to the music of VIRGO.</strong><br><br><i>Upon entering the atmosphere of a distant blue world, you are awoken from cryosleep to gather resources to fuel your interstellar journey onward. With the guidance of your on-board A.I., Gemini, hunt down crystal shards amid sunken monuments and alien flora. <br><br>When intermittent energy surges disable the link between you and Gemini, encounter a lone cybernetic jellyfish named Aqua. Travel through portals, dive to the depths of the ocean and fly on a hover transport that connects the ruins of a lost civilization. Enter the world and music of VIRGO on Water Planet before you launch back into hyperspace.</i><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/580520/extras/eee794a185ceba4501ba5f1e3d8fdc45.poster.avif?t=1572634545\" width=640 height=360 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/580520/extras/eee794a185ceba4501ba5f1e3d8fdc45.webm?t=1572634545\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/580520/extras/eee794a185ceba4501ba5f1e3d8fdc45.mp4?t=1572634545\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Developed in Unreal Engine 4<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >VR and Desktop Modes Both Supported</h2>Water Planet supports the HTC Vive with its motion controllers and standard desktop play as well.
