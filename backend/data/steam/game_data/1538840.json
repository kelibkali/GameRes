Now she is a pale shadow of her former self. Abandoned and almost of no interest to the Crown, she has fallen into the hands of local criminals who call themselves the Thieves Underground. Under their leadership, the corrupt city guards and the mysterious Church of Anar-Nehit, pilgrims from the far-southern deserts, control nearly every aspect of the city life.<br><br>Yet, even if the war has been over for half a century now, the patient and vile Ontorian Empire, just like a serpent that it bears on its banners, has prepared an even more cunning plan to seize neighbouring lands. <br><br>Under the guise of a relative of a local impoverished nobleman, Eiren, one of the Imperial spies sent to Tyrnia, will become part of a dastardly conspiracy to take over the unaware kingdom.<br><br>In order to successfully execute her orders, Agent Eiren joins the Prince’s people and will have to play her part in the liberation of the city. Together with Gieden, a crafty captain of Bryden’s forces, she begins the investigation of a daring crime that has shaken an already fragile balance in Kastra. <br><br>Eiren must act behind the backs of her unlikely allies, maintain their trust, and protect her true identity and motives at all costs. <br><br>But, perhaps, the hardest challenge for her to face will lie in the battle with her conscience and in the necessity for coming to terms with her own tragic past.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1538840/extras/a56eec3f5e9614de456a9d557bdd33e4.avif?t=1627757775\" width=236 height=76 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1538840/extras/1980428698e28b9e6b95ed1d096cbf6a.avif?t=1627757775\" width=616 height=172 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1538840/extras/c2af157e4ae513ebcbfed613df06d842.avif?t=1627757775\" width=616 height=172 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1538840/extras/e01ced2863afe7ad94af6e7568b4523d.avif?t=1627757775\" width=616 height=172 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1538840/extras/ecdd2d1c24f9d750ed51df696835dff1.avif?t=1627757775\" width=616 height=172 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1538840/extras/68995e8a8752c164f606b74c8c645c53.avif?t=1627757775\" width=616 height=172 /></span>",
