    "description": "Visual novels are story-based games, displaying characters on the screen while playing sounds and music in the background to create an immersive storytelling experience. Although most visual novels include branching paths and choices that affect the outcome of the story, <i>Detective Butler: Maiden Voyage Murder</i> has just one outcome. The only choice is how you choose to solve the mystery.<br><br><i>In 1962, a popular cruise ship goes out of business after the accidental deaths of two of its passengers. The ship remains a tourist attraction, until it sets sail again half a century later.<br><br>The CEO of a wealthy company takes his closest employees and son Gilligan on board for the maiden voyage.
