Initially leaving their hometown of Hibarigasaki was difficult for You, as he was close friends with a girl who he saw nearly every day after school at the local town lookout. When she discovered that You would be leaving the town, she made him promise to return to marry her and left him with simply a kiss on the forehead to remember her by. <br><br>Once You returns to his hometown, he searches for that childhood friend, only to find his previous meet-up location is now fenced-off and abandoned.
