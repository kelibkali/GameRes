    "description": "<strong>Prismatica</strong> is a puzzle game with a brand <strong>new twist</strong>, inspired by Rubik’s Cubes, Sudoku, Dodecahedrons and way, way too much caffeine.<br><br>The goal is to unscramble a series of puzzle boards by rotating multicolored pieces to match a logical pattern. It’s easy to learn and simple to play but surprisingly deep and difficult to master at later levels, presenting even the most veteran of puzzle enthusiasts with brain-tickling challenge.<br><br>Prismatica's aesthetic design and feel is intended to be calm and essentialist, presenting the player with a pure puzzle to focus on solving in a flowing natural way. A hauntingly beautiful soundtrack from award winning indie folk musician Svavar Knutur reinforces the stoic atmosphere of contemplation and mental challenge presented by the deceptively simple looking puzzles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Brand <strong>new &amp; innovative</strong> puzzle type<br></li><li> Old-school rotational <strong>chromatic combination</strong> mechanism<br></li><li> Clean <strong>essentialistic style</strong> and design aesthetics<br></li><li> Breathtakingly <strong>beautiful music</strong> by <strong>award winning</strong> indie folk musician Svavar Knutur<br></li><li> <strong>Simple</strong> gameplay that's <strong>easy</strong> to learn<br></li><li> <strong>Challenging</strong> puzzles that can be <strong>difficult</strong> to master<br></li><li> <strong>Intuitive</strong> and straightforward controls<br></li><li> Calmly tackle <strong>48 lovingly hand crafted puzzles</strong> in your own time or test your wit and speed in the new <strong>Challenge Mode</strong><br></li><li> Now includes <strong>color blind mode</strong> for added accessibility</li></ul>",
