In order to choose his replacement, he casts out Blood Scrolls all over the earth to a few chosen warriors. Upon receiving the Scrolls written in blood, each fighter regains memories of their past lives as shamans, warlords, and sacred monks, gaining long lost abilities including plasma manipulation and even levitation. In order to choose a replacement, each warrior must meet each other and conduct a battle of wits, strengths, and integrity to find the soul worthy of the throne. Some strive for a world of peace and harmony for all, while others relish in the pain of their enemies, thriving on war and negative energy. Choose your warrior and fight for your vision as you receive your Blood Scroll!",
