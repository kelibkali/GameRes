    "description": "Take the command of Free Nations Union forces and defeat the Phantom League on one of six distant planets. The rebels decided to seize the power on Earth by first conquering the space colonies, which provide vital energy resources to AOG. The war for global domination unrolls on continents, at sea, and in the air. With secret allies, you can disclose and provide troops at any moment, surprisingly shifting the power balance in a particular region. Lead your divisions, fleets, and air squadrons against those who dared threaten our freedom and democracy.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Original political system based on &quot;Secret Allies&quot; providing endless replayability <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Smooth and Dynamic Gameplay <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Full 3D Graphic Engine <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Huge 3D Landscapes <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>26 Detailed 3D Units <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Realistic Lighting, Explosions and Effects <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>3D Sound <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>6 Different Worlds (planets)<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li></ul>",
