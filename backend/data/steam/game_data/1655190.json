    "description": "&quot;AIKAGI&quot; is a visual novel. More specifically, it is a kinetic novel, without any branching routes.<br><br>During the last winter of his student days, Sunohara Nozomu finds himself at his wits' end. His parents told him to move out on his own to learn how to become more independent, but he's having trouble finding a place that feels like home, not to mention he's never even cooked for himself!<br><br>That's when his childhood friend, Takanashi Shiori, gives the conflicted Nozomu a shocking request.<br><br><strong>&quot;Um... W-Won't you come and live with me!?&quot;</strong><br><br>At first Nozomu isn't sure if living with someone will really help him become &quot;independent,&quot; but Shiori convinces his parents to let him live with her, and before he can give it much thought, everything has been arranged. They agree to live together for one month so that Nozomu can learn the ropes of living alone.<br><br>Experience the excitement of a new life together with your childhood friend!",
