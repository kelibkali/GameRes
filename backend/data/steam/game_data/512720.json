    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Are you hungry? It's time to eat or die trying.</h2>Welcome to the first, best, and only casual 3D claymation snakelike. Take control of a fast-growing serpent and feast on everything in sight (except things that explode of course). And don't run into your own wriggling tail. This is a game about eating from the maker of Retrobooster. Some game modes are about fast eating, while others are about strategic eating. In fact, Velocidevorium is pseudo-Latin for &quot;a place of swift devouring.&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Eating<br></li><li> Vomiting<br></li><li> Game controller support<br></li><li> Multiple mini-games<br></li><li> Split-screen combat modes<br></li><li> A multitude of unlockable levels<br></li><li> More eating<br></li><li> Extremely procedural levels (they morph continuously)<br></li><li> Ice cream!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Procedural blah blah blah</h2>You have heard all the usual chatter about procedural levels, but this game is different. Instead of generating a level and then tossing you into it, Velocidevorium's levels change every frame. The surface you are playing on constantly transforms. Watch the trailer closely and you'll get the idea.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Art style</h2>Stop-frame animation all the way! This world is made mostly out of clay, but you'll find other knick-knacks here too. Maybe the game should just be called Clay Simulator 2020.",
