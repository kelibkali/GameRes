    "description": "Hyper Fighters brings back the rail shooter as you know it from the arcade: fast, explosive, addictive, and easy to learn: but so hard to beat the number one highscore!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFourteen trigger-happy arcade-fun stages are now available for one or two players: Shoot dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of enemies out of the sky and water with three ultra modern fighters. This will require triggerhappy fingers and supersonic reflexes!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFace immense, massive and simply incredible endbosses that are each capable of destroying an entire nation by themselves. Do you have what it takes to destroy them all?<br />\r\n It won’t be easy!",
