    "description": "Vivid Spirit is a colorful hand drawn action-packed platformer where color dictates your actions. You'll guide our heroic young lady, Vivid, through the artistic world of Paper Craft and discover treasure, fight off amphibious wizards, and uncover the truth behind her lack of color. You'll even be able to play as her cute dog, Spirit!<br><br>This demo features an early build of a level called &quot;Azure Aqueduct&quot;. You'll be able to play as both Vivid and Spirit freely, where as in the full game, only Vivid is available for this level due to story reasons. You'll only have the base weapons and Power Pins for the demo. Vivid has the Crimson Blade, Golden Bow, and Azure Ax. Spirit meanwhile has the Fire Blitz, Electric Clone, and Arctic Whirlwind.<br><br>If you hold the ATTACK button, you can charge attacks! This will change how the weapons look and behave, so try playing around with them. This game is all about playing around with a variety of moves. Curious how to perform various attacks? Press SELECT (or Control on a Keyboard) to open up a Movelist Guide. This will show you all the moves a weapon can do, and even tell you about your current Power Pin! You'll have access to the full movelist, so there are a lot of options to choose from.<br><br>You can freely change controls! Just go to the Pause Menu, select Controls and change away! Here are the base controls:<br><br><strong>MOVE RIGHT</strong> (Keyboard: RIGHT / Controller: RIGHT) <i>Note: Game supports Analog Stick controls!</i><br><strong>MOVE LEFT </strong>(Keyboard: LEFT / Controller: LEFT)<br><strong>DUCK / DOWNWARD SPIRAL</strong> (Keyboard: DOWN / Controller: DOWN)<br><strong>EMOTE / UP</strong> (Keyboard: UP/ Controller: UP)<br><strong>JUMP</strong> (Keyboard: A / Controller: A)<br><strong>ATTACK</strong> (Keyboard: S / Controller: X)<br><strong>CHANGE CHARACTER </strong>(Keyboard: X / Controller: Y)<br><strong>POWER PIN</strong> (Keyboard: Z / Controller: B)<br><strong>L &amp; R </strong>(Keyboard: Q &amp; E / Controller: LEFT BUMPER &amp; RIGHT BUMPER)<br><strong>PAUSE / CONFIRM</strong> (Keyboard: ENETER / Controller: START)<br><strong>MINI GUIDE </strong>(Keyboard: CONTROL / Controller: SELECT)<br><br><i>Note: 3rd Party or Controllers not made by Microsoft may function differently. You may have to change the games setup or use a program that allows these controllers to run like a 1st party device.</i><br><br>This game has an option to help people with color blindness play! Go to &quot;Color Emblems&quot; in the Options Menu to show what color Vivid, Spirit, and the Enemies are via a floating shape over their heads!<br><br>Try speed running the demo and show us how good you can get! Can you beat it in under 2 minutes?",
