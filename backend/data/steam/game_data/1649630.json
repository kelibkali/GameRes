You must battle your way through 6 dungeon zones, win by reaching the crystal at the end of each zone. Before each zone you'll have the opportunity to buy weapons ands perks with gold. You can also take on curses, which pay out rich gold rewards in exchange for taking on random debuffs. <br><br>In each zone your health will constantly drain, gain health back by defeating monsters. Killing monsters also fills your berserk meter, which once full, gives the ability to transform into a powerful beast form for a limited time. <br><br>When you finish a run, you earn experience and level up. Levelling up unlocks new options for your starting load-out. You can unlock new Artifacts, Beast forms and Classes each with special abilities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >FEATURES</h2>- Time-attack shooter rogue-lite gameplay, full runs take around 30 mins<br><br>- Beast transformation mechanic with customisable beast weapons<br><br>- Risk deadly curses and alternate zones in exchange for golden rewards<br><br>- 20+ devastating weapons<br><br>- 3 playable classes: Berserker, Brigand and Stalwart<br><br>- 5 Unlockable 'Descension' difficulty settings<br><br>- Randomised zone layouts for added variety<br><br>- Hand-drawn pixel art and animations<br><br>- Original soundtrack by Cletus Lupus<br><br><br><br>Berserk Mode is inspired by games I love like Post Void, Noita, Doom/Heretic/Hexen and Devil Daggers. I wanted to make a fantasy FPS rogue-lite style game that was fun to pick up and play and while offering some depth and variety for replay-ability. I hope you'll letting off some steam in Berserk Mode. <br><br>Cheers!<br>Adam",
