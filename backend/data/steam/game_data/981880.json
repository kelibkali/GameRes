You play as a small gorilla, escaped from a military testing facility, who has gained the ability to grow by eating. Now you seek revenge on your tormentors by carefully gobbling up food and growing into an unstoppable monster to take them down.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/981880/extras/daf07b521a5573644304bf4fceb73baf.poster.avif?t=1768985843\" width=600 height=300 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/981880/extras/daf07b521a5573644304bf4fceb73baf.webm?t=1768985843\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/981880/extras/daf07b521a5573644304bf4fceb73baf.mp4?t=1768985843\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/981880/extras/defd8ac6de29db97735eeaa19494e85f.webp?t=1768985843\" width=256 height=59 /></span><br><br>What starts as a fast paced, stealthy survival game quickly evolves into an intense battle as you grow into an oversized giant and wreak havoc.
