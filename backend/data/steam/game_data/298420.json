    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Experience the mesmerizing world of Dreii, the award-winning collaborative physics conundrum. </h2><br>Dreii is a puzzling game about skill, logic and friendship. It subtly connects players in real-time across the world, to help one another in a battle against gravity.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Build a Tower.</strong> The mission is simple. But once again, things get in the way... Explosives, thunderstorms, completely incompetent colleagues. Oh, and have you heard of this thing called gravity?<br><br></li><li><strong>Play with your friends.</strong> Dreii automatically connects all screens across all platforms. This means you can even play with your friends who have Dreii on their mobiles.<br><br></li><li><strong>Speak in 19 Languages.</strong> Dreii features an universal communication tool which allows players to speak to others, wherever they are in the world.<br><br></li><li><strong>Let's Dance!</strong> One of the best thing about Dreii is how it sounds. Each player has its very own instrument. Avatars work together to form Dreii's unique universal orchestra, creating a unique musical landscape, inspired by archaic instruments and ancient melodies.<br><br></li><li><strong>Uber Swiss Design.</strong> Dreii is designed to be as universal as possible. However, in a strange way it's also very Swiss, where it was made. Clean typography, minimalism with attention to detail. Maybe that is why it has won the European Design Award.</li></ul>",
