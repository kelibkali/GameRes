She has single-handedly ensured the continuous flow of the newly-deceased for the past century, leading them to their respective planets in the Mother Realm.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Unless, ever so often, a soul dares to defy its own fate.</h2><br><br><i>“Battle on, little soul. Enter my arenas, emerge victorious a thousand times, and be granted control over your destiny here in the Mother Realm.”</i><br><br>------<br><br><strong>Contents ::</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>1.
