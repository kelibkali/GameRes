There is a passionate, sorrowful undertone throughout which carries you along.<br>I really want you to play and experience it.<br><br>If you like this great soundtrack, please play Artifact Adventure Gaiden DX!<br><br>There is a unity between the game-play and game music, they blend together to produce a fantastic gameplay experience!<br><br>bluffman<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1167720/extras/a63dd9cc18c94b795ae500c732587909.avif?t=1581558501\" width=600 height=338 /></span>",
