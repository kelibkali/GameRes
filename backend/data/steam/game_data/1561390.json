The sweet and juicy milk is but the only thing that can save the human race. It’s raw kinetic energy has enough power to sustain our super-future societies and it is up to you, Spaceman Scott, to acquire it.  <br><br>The journey ahead will not be an easy one. Milk can be a treacherous and unforgiving element, and the worlds that you will find it are fraught with great peril. Indeed, some say that the milk is doomed. You will need to work quickly if you are to survive this journey.",
