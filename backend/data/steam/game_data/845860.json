I personally like the fact that the game feeds me constantly new problems to solve.&quot;<br>Marco Arnaudo<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >How to Play</h2>On your turn, move up to 3 steps in the mine, then do one action.<br><br><br><strong>Building Rooms</strong><br>Building rooms is the main way to score points! If you move into a room that doesn't exist yet, you have to build it.  Spend cards from your hand that include all the gems on the door you're building.  (Most cards have 2 gems, and can be spent as either <i>or both!</i>)  Choose the rotation of the new room and add it to the mine.<br><br><strong>Collecting Gems</strong><br>For your action, use a room's special ability to draw more gem cards.  Different rooms have different rules for drawing cards, so choosing the right room for your situation is key!  (If you can't find a useful room, you can always draw a single card instead.)<br><br>At the start of your next turn, if you have more than 4 cards, you'll have to discard down to 4.<br><br><strong>Winning</strong><br>In <i>Rush Mode</i>, the players race against each other.  Have the most points at the end of the round when anyone reaches the point target.<br><br>In <i>Crisis Mode</i>, the players race against the clock.  You'll be forced to &quot;burn&quot; cards from the deck every turn, removing them from the game.  Reach the target score before the cards are all gone!",
