People were free and had everything to live a good life; neither they knew war nor misery. <br><br>But, yes - the time of peace and harmony could not last forever. Ażgordàr, the god of wrath and deception, brought the balance in sway as he betrayed his own siblings. And so it began; the ancient foundations of divine equilibrium broke, and bitterness and immorality found their way to the heart of men. Where hatred and bitterness triumph, inequality and war are not far away. And so, he will rise from the abyss to divide brothers and sisters, promising gold but bringing the sword. Therefore, see and behold, disease and death follow in his shadow.&quot; </i><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2026780/extras/description_frame_bottom.png?t=1706970335\" /></span><br><br>Explore the different ages, gods, creatures and flora, and the legends and tales of Arafinn.
