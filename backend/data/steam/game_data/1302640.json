In this demo, you'll be able to play Act 0 of the game. You'll learn where you are from, drive down a twisting road on a little bike and arrive at the forest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe demo contains Act 0 and one minigame. You'll get a preview of the path system that comes with the full game and you'll get a feel of how the game works.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVenge is an indie game created by Ekrcoaster, this game contains 5 Acts (2 released currently) and plenty of unique minigames that build off of the main game.
