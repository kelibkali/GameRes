    "description": "<i>A minimalistic platformer with a 1x1 tileset. No enemies, no bullets, no lasers. Just sheer platforming.</i><br><br>Micro Platformer is a seriously minimalistic 2D platformer. A 1x1 tileset and a small square is not just a part of the artwork, it's a way to tell you exactly what the hitboxes are. Why? Well, there are quite a few difficulity levels. Some of them are not easy. At all. I wanted this game to be the simplest platformer I could possibly make, without making it empty, or easy. Did I do a good job? Well, one way to find out! c: Oh yeah, the classic feature listing. Here:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Different difficulty levels - play whatever fits your skill and patience best!<br></li><li>Best time measurement - how fast can you beat a level?<br></li><li>Respawn count - inb4 500 respawns on hard<br></li><li>Fps limiter - wowzies, that surely is a rare thing these days!
