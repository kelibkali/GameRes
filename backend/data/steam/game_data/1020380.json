    "description": "This is the third collection of 9 in-game music tracks to enhance Flatspace IIk. Like any in-game music for Flatspace, these will trigger at random when you enter a new sector.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe original Music Pack 3 for Flatspace II was released in 2013 and contained as selection of game music, and unreleased tracks. I also wanted to include some recent music, to reflect the sort of music I compose and perform now, and also evoke feelings of space at the end of time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack includes a full description of the music as a pdf booklet. Here is an outline of the music included:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdrift In Flat Space<br />\r\nAn original track for this Music Pack, this track is a solo-piano improvisation that uses the main Flatspace theme as its source material.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJellyfish<br />\r\nA fast race of notes from the my album of catchy game-like tunes, Bites of Greatness.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nParagon<br />\r\nParagon is one of the final tracks from one of my earliest albums, Animalia. Inspired by Darwinian genetics, this is a unique edit made for this Music Pack.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRace The Sky<br />\r\nA supremely happy track which was originally included in the old Flatspace II Music Pack 3.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRequiem For A Million Skin Cells<br />\r\nComposed in 2017 for the album Cycles &amp; Shadows, this brooding piano track originally began with a droned speech about the ageing process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Dying Of The Stars<br />\r\nA new track for this music pack, I wanted to include some music that had a naturalistic feeling, that could evoke the beauty and mystery of outer space.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTiny Moon<br />\r\nA simple piece of music which was also present in the original Flatspace II Music Pack.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWaiting For The Rain To End<br />\r\nThis track evokes the passing time in a dark month. The full track is present on the album The Twelve Seasons.",
