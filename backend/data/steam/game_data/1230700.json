    "description": "This is the first puzzle box in the puzzle collection based on the classical painter <strong>Frederic Edwin Church</strong>*. The <strong>Heart of the Andes</strong> is a composite of the South American topography observed during his travels. At the center-right of the landscape is a shimmering pool served by a waterfall. The snow-capped Mount Chimborazo of Ecuador appears in the distance; the viewer's eye is led to it by the darker, closer slopes that decline from right to left. The evidence of human presence is shown by the lightly worn path, a hamlet and church lying in the central plain, and closer to the foreground, two natives are seen before a cross. The church, a trademark detail in Church's paintings, is Catholic and Spanish-colonial, and seemingly inaccessible from the viewer's location. Church's signature appears to cut into the bark of the highlighted foreground tree at left. The play of light on his signature has been interpreted as the artist's statement of man's ability to tame nature—yet the tree appears in poor health compared to the vivid jungle surrounding it.<br><br><br>Church's landscape conformed to the aesthetic principles of the picturesque, as propounded by the British theorist William Gilpin, which began with a careful observation of nature enhanced by particular notions about composition and harmony. The juxtaposition of smooth and irregular forms was an important principle and is represented in The Heart of the Andes by the rounded hills and pool of water on the one hand, and by the contrasting jagged mountains and rough trees on the other.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Content Details</h2>Contains <i>one</i> new puzzle box for Masters of Puzzle. The UHD image captures the original painting in great detail which in turn allows for very detailed and diverse puzzle tiles. The similarity of the colors and the lush vegetation in many parts of the image will represent a challenge. The mountains, depending on the number of puzzle tiles, might also prove difficult to assemble. This puzzle box will represent medium to high challenge for most puzzle builders.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1230700/extras/6de88d7055a24b8806cab6ef2eb5c88e.webp?t=1580415327\" width=32 height=32 /></span> * <i>Note: The painting used in this DLC is in the public domain in its country of origin and other countries and areas where the copyright term is the author's life plus 100 years or less.</i>",
