In order to defeat enemies and finish the level you have to find all armor pieces. Some of these pieces are easy to get but some are not. There are also enemies that can’t be killed. You should try to get by them without getting hit in order to get your armor.   With every piece of armor that you gather you’ll become more stronger and you’ll be able to defeat enemies that are guarding the next area of the map.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1336230/extras/60459816c683dfeeaf1863797d6d1904.poster.avif?t=1595067860\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1336230/extras/60459816c683dfeeaf1863797d6d1904.webm?t=1595067860\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1336230/extras/60459816c683dfeeaf1863797d6d1904.mp4?t=1595067860\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>At the end of the map,  by entering the portal,  you can use the Robot avatar to get past the racing challenge .<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1336230/extras/c3a037028ecc1d36065ee13f1cc16cd9.poster.avif?t=1595067860\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1336230/extras/c3a037028ecc1d36065ee13f1cc16cd9.webm?t=1595067860\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1336230/extras/c3a037028ecc1d36065ee13f1cc16cd9.mp4?t=1595067860\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Avoid obstacles in a running like game  and reach the end of the level in order to unlock the Guardian (Boss like creature) from the next map.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1336230/extras/a93ecb1794e98caa2130898229e7edaa.poster.avif?t=1595067860\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1336230/extras/a93ecb1794e98caa2130898229e7edaa.webm?t=1595067860\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1336230/extras/a93ecb1794e98caa2130898229e7edaa.mp4?t=1595067860\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Avrach Resurrection has 20 levels in total :  10 RPG like maps , 9 running/race like maps with obstacles , and 1 Rpg final Boss map.
