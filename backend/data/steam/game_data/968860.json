    "description": "<strong>DEFENTURES</strong> - defense mid-core game. Lead your dwarves, help them to reach treasures. Choose their tiers, use magic and upgrade global skills.<br><br><strong>CLASSIC BATTLE MECHANICS</strong><br>Fight with hordes of enemies in the spirit of old computer strategies and favorite flash defense games.<br><br><strong>ACTIVE BACKGROUND</strong><br>Each location has its own mechanic. Brave amazons hide in the forest, the leader of the wolf pack is seated on the rocky ledge. Use all possible resources.<br><br><strong>FLEXIBLE UPGRADE WARRIROS IN BATTLE</strong><br>Pump your dwarves as you like. Adjust to the incoming wave of enemies. Do you want dwarf thief? Do you want a master of swords with crit hits? Or maybe a golem summoner? No problem!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/968860/extras/7f07cd25eb2cb93fb4f830f6bd106d70.avif?t=1588617567\" width=600 height=72 /></span><br><br><strong>GUILDS</strong><br>In guilds, you can receive special assignments with new mechanics. Do you want to lead the orcs? Or become a magister of magic? Well, or to rob caravans?<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/968860/extras/557ceeab2f535132bcdd1f3e3c2be244.avif?t=1588617567\" width=610 height=133 /></span><br><br><strong>System of global skills</strong><br>In addition to dwarf upgrades in the locations, you have various permanent skills.<br>To open them you will have to prove worthy in battles. And for the most interesting will have to sweat in guilds. Calling meteor showers or being a berserker is not easy.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/968860/extras/5a8375a118fe99dc0b012414a46e26eb.avif?t=1588617567\" width=600 height=147 /></span><br><br><strong>NEW APPROACH TO BATTLES</strong><br>Unlike similar games, where the whole battle is focused at one point of the screen, I introduced a system to block the movement of the soldiers. A dwarf with a goblin is fighting 1 to 1. A dwarf with a huge 5 to 1. If the dwarves or enemies are too many, they go ahead to defeat the base sooner.<br><br><strong>FLEXIBLE COMPLEXITY SYSTEM</strong><br>Think tactics, calculate every action or relax and pile on the enemy, choose only you.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/968860/extras/393977873d6d570d39459d3bcc5fd60b.avif?t=1588617567\" width=610 height=131 /></span>",
