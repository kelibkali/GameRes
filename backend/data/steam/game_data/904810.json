Its controls are simple but nuanced, letting players become the Outlier, an alien creature hauled from another dimension and discarded into a dangerous wasteland.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/904810/extras/f8ac50e54418e7e431b3cf173dbb77cc.poster.avif?t=1638449088\" width=600 height=450 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/904810/extras/f8ac50e54418e7e431b3cf173dbb77cc.webm?t=1638449088\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/904810/extras/f8ac50e54418e7e431b3cf173dbb77cc.mp4?t=1638449088\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Survive a strange and dangerous environment</h2>As the Outlier, leap and cling to surfaces.
