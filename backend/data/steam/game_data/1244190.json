Utilize switches and warps to tackle unpassable walls. Traverse through ice and mud, which change how the echidna can move blocks. Work with paired blocks, which move in tandem. These obstacles are more common as the echidna progresses throughout the burrow, and they often combine to create increasingly complex puzzles.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1244190/extras/0b7e579658db8dd2e7249c183d032001.poster.avif?t=1754055369\" width=416 height=256 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1244190/extras/0b7e579658db8dd2e7249c183d032001.webm?t=1754055369\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1244190/extras/0b7e579658db8dd2e7249c183d032001.mp4?t=1754055369\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Boss Fights</h2>Every now and then, the echidna will have a run-in with the moles and get a chance to show them who's boss!
