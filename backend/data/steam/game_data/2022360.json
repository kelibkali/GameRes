    "description": "<br><br>Heal &amp; Hurt is a fast-paced old school arena shooter where you switch sides from angel to skeleton and vice versa every time you die! Both characters have unique abilities that you can use to outclass your opponents. You should also pay attention to damage types as you can either heal or hurt your enemies (and yourself!)<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2022360/extras/3f7bda53dbea7214e20a821116994afc.poster.avif?t=1677256893\" width=598 height=336 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2022360/extras/3f7bda53dbea7214e20a821116994afc.webm?t=1677256893\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2022360/extras/3f7bda53dbea7214e20a821116994afc.mp4?t=1677256893\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>There two different gamemodes to choose from.&quot;Deathmatch&quot; is the normal mode where you must eliminate your opponents in order to win! The other mode is called &quot;Hold the Crown&quot; where you and the others will compete for the crown that will give you score.<br><br>When playing as an angel, you can fly through the skies and take out your opponents from high ground! You should also notice that when diving underwater you will eventually drown if you don't remember to get some fresh air.<br><br>As a skeleton you can take advantage and slide to avoid enemies firing. Skeletons are also keen in diving as they won't drown underwater, they can also pass through the bony walls found in the maps.<br><br>When playing as either of the characters the visuals of the surrounding world will change. Both characters can also use teleports to get fast from location to another!<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Switch sides when you die from an angel to skeleton and vice versa<br></li><li> Heal or hurt your enemies (and yourself!)<br></li><li> 6 different weapons<br></li><li> 2 gamemodes<br></li><li> Rocket jumping<br></li><li> Teleports<br></li><li> Flying<br></li><li> Sliding</li></ul>",
