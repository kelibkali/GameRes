The impression is displayed publicly to all students of the school with an approval meter. Every student in the school has the right to vote twice during the year, and it’s completely optional.<br><br>Students in the elite class should start two clubs and then share the news of these two clubs with the rest of the school.<br><br>Students of the school will want to vote based on the elite class' grades, club news, and any other news about the class.<br><br>If the approval meter drops, the class will stop and all eight students return to their regular classes.<br><br>The elite class has its own budget that they can spend on anything they want.<br><br>And other features, including the rule of self-management in the sense that they manage everything in the class themselves.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About the game:</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1439420/extras/f52d7281541bb197c9c91616e4a31274.avif?t=1656164363\" width=330 height=282 /></span><br>The game is about developing the skills of a robot that talks to him all the time for the purpose of learning from him.<br><br>The game is only played once at a time, meaning only Ayoub is now playing in the world.<br><br>The game is for one main player and Ayoub has been chosen. The experience of Ayoub will be added to the players in the previous years before him.<br><br>The game required a completely new experience for the main player which is what the elite class provides to Ayoub.<br><br>The game will consider every danger threatening the continuation of the class as a level and the main player (Ayoub) has to win this level by getting rid of the danger.<br>The number of secret members to the game, which the game also calls ‘players’ are 7, who are the rest of Ayoub’s classmates.<br><br>The game will show the name of everyone who does something wrong to threaten the class or harm any of the school students.<br><br>This boy will get a card. He finds it in his locker, on his desk, or anywhere that belongs to him.<br>The card will be lit until the level is over.<br><br>Once the level is over, the card will be switched off.<br><br>The level can end as soon as the danger is removed. (If the level ends due to an action by Ayoub, then he wins the level.)<br><br>Anyone else (other than the 7 students and Ayoub) who causes a problem that harms the class will get a card, but the game will show it anonymously. (“unknown”)<br><br>Any of the seven players can exit the game, and Ayoub will no longer see his name, instead of his name the word “unknown” will appear, that will only happen if they know about the game.<br><br><strong>The second type of cards:</strong><br>Sometimes Ayoub will see a card but this card will not be lit and not real.<br><br><br><br><br><i>Read the story to learn more about those cards.</i>",
