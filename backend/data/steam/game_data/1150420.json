Current project: figure out what R&amp;D stands for and if you can drink it.<br></li><li><strong>Motor Church</strong><br>Followers of the holy Devidsan are crazy in love with their water scooters, or maybe they are simply crazy, anyway, these are the guys that go scavenging and bring in the fuel and junk for all our construction needs.<br></li><li><strong>A.C.D.C. (Anarcho Communistic Democratic Community)</strong><br>A bunch of politically correct weirdos. Unpredictable and aggressive: a natural choice for our law enforcement service!</li></ul><br>All these guys hate each other with all their rotten hearts and unless you manage to preserve a balance of power between them you are pretty much done for!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1150420/extras/44bba557930a0154fd6ef04848f376a4.webp?t=1724734732\" width=119 height=36 /></span><br>Collect resources and expand Junk City’s infrastructure in order to collect more resources and expand even further.

Send out “exploratory” expeditions and watch as they bring home tons of neat loot.",
