Patchman may have thought he finally redeemed himself, but he's got exponentially more trouble to deal with in <i>Patchman vs. Blue Squares!</i>  First Patchman defeated the Circle Boss and rescued the Sheeple of Forest World in the first episode: <i>Patchman vs. Red Circles</i>, and now he needs to confront the Square Boss and rescue the Sheeple of Office World!

Imagine <i>Dunder Mifflin</i> meets <i>Gringotts</i> in <i>The Matrix!</i>  The Sheeple of this world love wearing suits and ties, going to boardroom meetings, and grabbing tasty snacks from Vending Machines! However under the shiny surface of Office World lies an outcast segment of society: the Homeless Sheeple! They have to live off of discarded food package wrappers dug out of trash bins. Yes, Patchman will have to rescue them all!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/798630/extras/13b4cf3bc31b4e4683c51bfa1c23c02e.avif?t=1603560713\" width=620 height=156 /></span><br><br>A world of offices isn't going to be all coffee mugs and suits.  There was a cost!  First thing you'll have to do in the game is help the <strong>Sheeple Drifter</strong> finish his new shopping cart invention!  Turns out this drifter was a pretty important person back in the day, having built a revolutionary new cubicle for the Sheeple.  Unfortunately it turned out to be a trap, and now he's lost his family and eight workers, and it's all tied into the outrageous origins of the Square Boss, our big baddie of this episode!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/798630/extras/7ad112d8064636afc813044339d91583.avif?t=1603560713\" width=620 height=152 /></span><br><br>A reconfigurable, transformable, crazy boss with an attitude!
