This game will help you better learn the basics of programming without spending much time and money by learning through the visual system in the quests. <br>The game contains 13 levels, each of which accommodates 1-3 scripts on the gaming scene. With each passed level the game is integrated into a complex puzzle, which demonstrates the various functions and variables within scripts. <br>The gameplay encourages interaction, exploration, teaches a method of trial and error. A good game leaves the player with time to develop his skills, the same thing happens in the learning process. Naturally, to understand the scripts you'll need to explore the library of functions. Through these actions the player will learn new tools and discover his own abilities to programming. The very visual programming does not require the initial preparation for the game, the quests themselves teach a player, allowing him to understand the basic principles of programming. All that is required for the player is logic, which helps training and completing levels.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/760360/extras/38f14617165f9aa06ba455b89bae0656.avif?t=1528213018\" width=599 height=142 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/760360/extras/28313830d26c8dc4c381b760aa13a3ba.webp?t=1528213018\" width=572 height=2 /></span><br>In the game there is also a sandbox, you can use it for implementation of your different ideas, or just for practice or study. There will be enough tools in the library for implementation practically any of your ideas, and what is the most important, the implementation of different logics in the sandbox due to visual programming goes free and easy as the context dependence solves problems with syntax errors, however before passing into the sandbox we recommend you to pass the storyline in order to understand how the system of visual scripting works.",
