    "description": "It's that time and season again when the absolute test of marksmanship is <br />\r\non display again. It's a contest of skill, it's a contest of the ability to <br />\r\ntarget and take out targets. It's Balloon Fiesta 3D time again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou are armed with a simple dart gun in this fun contest. You will be <br />\r\nsituated in several fiestas, stages where balloons rise from holes in the <br />\r\nfloor. You'll have to be vigilant, read the hints, watch the signs if you <br />\r\nwant to survive this contest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe simple rule here, blast away any balloons you see, make sure none of <br />\r\nthem floats beyond your reach to the ceiling. Sounds easy right? Except in <br />\r\nsome fiestas, there are holes all around you and you will have to swing <br />\r\naround a lot to shoot balloons. In other fiestas, you have rotating floors <br />\r\nand targeting is going to be very difficult. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd in some fiestas, balloons are coming from holes located even further <br />\r\naway from your position, targeting is going to be quite difficult.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake this hint to survive in this title, try to shoot balloons as they <br />\r\nemanate from their holes. Do not focus on just a hole and the balloons <br />\r\nproceeding from it. If you do that, other holes will produce balloons that <br />\r\nwill float beyond your reach before you are aware.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBalloon Fiesta 3D is another lightweight title running with minimum memory <br />\r\nand hard disk requirements making it suitable for lightweight PCs. It is <br />\r\nalso designed to be suitable for all ages.",
