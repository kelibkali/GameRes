Every bike is built around real proportions, real behavior, and a physics system designed to reward precision, control, and progression. This is not arcade racing: it’s about learning, improving, and pushing your limits lap after lap.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Total Freedom on Two (and More) Wheels</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Choose from a wide range of vehicles including pitbikes, dirt bikes, superbikes, ATVs, three-wheelers, sidecar MX, and prototype machines. Each vehicle delivers a unique riding style and requires a different approach to master. One game, countless ways to ride.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Train, Compete, and Race Online</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Ride solo to refine your skills or jump online to race against other players. Compete in online sessions, compare lap times, and push your limits against riders from all over the world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1511630/extras/0902dd2707f18489d006b6c2889557b3.avif?t=1771260757\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1511630/extras_big/0902dd2707f18489d006b6c2889557b3.avif?t=1771260757 width=1560 height=878 /></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Global Rankings and Competitive Tournaments</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >TrackDayR features a global worldwide ranking system that tracks your performance across sessions and modes.

Frequent updates introduce new bikes, tracks, physics improvements, new competitive features, and additional game modes driven directly by the community.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Deep Modding Support – Powered by the Community</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Modding is a core pillar of TrackDayR. Modders actively create bikes and tracks of every kind, experimenting with wildly different configurations, setups, and riding styles — from realistic replicas to unique, unconventional concepts. On our side, MadCow provides increasingly powerful and up-to-date modding tools, designed to give creators full control and freedom. Our goal is simple: give the community the space and the tools to push TrackDayR far beyond its default content.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Every Detail Matters</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >From tire behavior and weight transfer to riding lines and braking technique, every decision affects performance. TrackDayR rewards riders who learn, adapt, and refine their style.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1511630/extras/c310217cbe886eff029a12a63ec56852.avif?t=1771260757\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1511630/extras_big/c310217cbe886eff029a12a63ec56852.webp?t=1771260757 width=1560 height=869 /></span></p>",
