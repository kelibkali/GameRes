    "description": "Here is the soundtrack of the game. This is a good omen for the start of the third decade of the 21 century. Is also a gift for those people who bought the game in its first month of release. This DLC could have cost 10$ otherwise or never be released to the public. Please enjoy your new DLC with good headphones.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you like it, please consider buying the base game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNotes:<br />\r\n* The music was designed for Headphones in mind.<br />\r\n* Due the nature of the game, the music itself could be a potential spoiler. Is recommended to play the game first.<br />\r\n* Composing music is a job, the fact that this DLC is free does not imply the devaluation of it, it is a gift for the players; please don't dismiss the work of being a composer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanks again and Enjoy!",
