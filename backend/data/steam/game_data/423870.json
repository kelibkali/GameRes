    "description": "Astervoid 2000 is a 1 to 4 player local-multiplayer​ space brawler, combining classic arcade action with modern gameplay. <br><br>We've re-envisioned the 1979 hit Asteroids, but as a couch-multiplayer deathmatch game. Set your nav for the asteroid fields and your phasers to kill! Your goal is to blast your opponents into space rubble. Astervoid 2000 doesn't feature any power-ups, so it all comes down to your piloting skill. Explosive, indestructible, and projectile-ricocheting icy asteroids will slam against your ship, or can be weaponized against or by your opponents. Show them who's best!<br><br><strong>(Perfect support for gamepads as well as keyboard and mouse.)</strong><br><br>Original Soundtrack is also available on Bandcamp.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >FEATURES:</h2><br><strong>Survival Mode</strong><br>Fight against waves of AI controlled ships. The faster you destroy enemy ships the higher your score. Earn your place on our leaderboard!<br><br><strong>Versus Mode</strong><br>2 to 4 players compete head to head against one another in a free-for-all or team deathmatch. This is the way the game was meant to be played. Show your friends who the best pilot is by mastering the game's tight controls and turning them into space dust.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING:</h2><br>&quot;Jousting in space! ... I could see this game being like massive, just like heaps of people playin' it.&quot; - Gamerholics Anonymous<br><br>&quot;It's a tight game ... There's games that have just bad, sloppy controls. Then there's other games that have slightly better controls. And then there's this games like this that have extremely tight controls, where we can dash anytime we want instead of waiting on a cooldown and thus having this game be 100% skill based.&quot; -- Scythe Plays<br><br>&quot;A very well put together game. If you guys have a weekend with downtime, with your friends or roommates and you guys are looking for something new to chill out on, this would be a really sweet drinking game. I could definitely see that.&quot; - Real Game Media<br><br>&quot;Many of the sounds, which are not so retrospective, remind me of films like Tron Legancy and catch the futuristic charm.&quot; -- GameContrast.de (rough translation from German)<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >CREDITS</h2><br>Design/Development: Justin Luk<br>Music/SFX/Development: Chuck Bergeron<br><br>Additional Music: Memorecks<br>Artwork: Sven Ruthner, Lachlan Cartland<br>Promotional Artwork: Lyndsay Wasko<br>Big thanks to: Frank Meijer, our friends &amp; family<br><br>Thanks to Gamerholics Anonymous for the 4-player video footage!
