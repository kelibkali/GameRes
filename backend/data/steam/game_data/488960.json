    "description": "Build Your Strategy. Squash Space Snails. Be a Star Viking.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Star Vikings Forever you will build your team of spacefaring Vikings to take on the evil scourge of intergalactic snails in a fun and nearly endless stream of challenging puzzles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBest Indie at Google Play Best of 2017, Finalist at the Google Play Indie Games Festival, Winner for &quot;Best Game Design&quot; at the Brazilian Independent Games Festival, and “Most Offensive Game Ever” at the Space Snails Game Conference. Star Vikings Forever is a humorous Puzzle/RPG developed by the award-winning creators of Chroma Squad, Dungeonland, and Relic Hunters Zero.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPosition your team of uniquely built Vikings to strategically attack enemies, and clear the board.  Enemies aren’t the brightest, and will attack each other whenever they are attacked. This creates a very satisfying chain-combo system, where you can wipe entire boards with a few moves to clear a path to advance to the next stage, or to complete a specific objective. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake your time and strategize, or for faster paced combat, make multiple moves simultaneously. Puzzles are procedurally generated, allowing for unique and nonlinear challenges every time. Each character has a standard melee attack, along with a special ability attack that will send snails crying home to their shells. Each special ability is unique to their class and provides an additional layer of strategy in solving puzzles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStar Vikings’ unique gameplay is packed full of content, and will turn even your non-gamer grandma into a hardcore min-maxing machine by the time the credits roll!",
