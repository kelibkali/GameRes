Following the same story as the movie, Winnie the Pooh is an interactive story book focused on delivering action-driven storytelling and incorporating educational content for children. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is split up into chapters, each offering a new piece of the story, allowing players to interact with the backgrounds via a variety of kid friendly ‘no failure’ mini games. Once chapters are completed, Honey Pots are awarded which can be used to unlock content within the print center. In the print center, parents can print out activity sheets for the children to color in and complete.",
