    "description": "Cubito Mayhem is an top down 2D twin stick shooter with rogue-like and bullet hell elements that uses dense, chaotic and action packed levels and bossfights to tell the story of a square shaped citizen that refused to follow the traditions and guidelines of the society it is a part of. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe polygonal society &quot;Socielatera&quot; condemns change and sticks strictly to conventional and ancient ways of representing progress. The main way to tell a member of the society is growing and progressing is the transformation of their members in a ritual called &quot;Laterappono&quot; carried periodically by the most ancient members. Since its beginnings the most powerful and respected members of &quot;Socielatera&quot; were always the citizens with the most sides shaping their physical body. &quot;Laterappono&quot; consists in the transformation of the body to apply one extra side to the body. Triangles become squares, squares become pentagons and so on.",
