The Arab side, mostly Egypt and Syria, attacks Israeli troops by surprise simultaneously in the Sinai and the Golan, to get a foothold again on their land claims. Israel must hold and then counter-attack to obtain victory.<br><br>Kippur 1973 lasts 19 turns representing each one day between October 6th and 24th, 1973. The two sides facing each other are, on the one side the Arab Alliance made of Egypt and syria, with the assistance of other brother countries (Irak, Morroco, Sudan...) and, on the other side, Israel. <br>The Arabs will launch two simultaneous but separate offensives during the festivities of Kippur, one in the Sinaï and the other in the Golan. <br>The Israeli player, initially taken by surprise, will have to defend the borders.<br><br>The initial Arab onslaught is rather violent, but Israel central location allows for a more flexible choice in reinforcement allocation. Impact on air forces, SAM missiles and the Suez canal are keys to the game.<br><br>The game's event cards allow full replay ability thanks to the numerous various situations that they create on the diplomatic, military, political or economical fields.<br><br><strong>Estimated Playtime</strong>: 4h00.<br><strong>Favored Side</strong>: Arabs.<br><strong>Hardest to Play</strong>: Israel.",
