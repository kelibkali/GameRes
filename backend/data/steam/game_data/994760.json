    "description": "<strong>ABOUT THE GAME:</strong><br><br>On a quest to retrieve the last and mightiest crystal, you and your friend arrives at an ancient temple, rumoured to be built and guarded by a very powerful wizard named Aechuporith the Great. Only two people are allowed to enter the temple at one time. You have to prove yourselves worthy of the last crystal by overcoming many challenges together as a team. Thousands of previous explorers had failed miserably and were punished with terrible curses. Will you be the one to succeed? Now, it’s your turn.<br><br><strong>Unique co-op mechanics:</strong> Team up with a friend and work together to solve challenging puzzles and fight epic monsters. Discover various weapons and powers. For a challenge, you can play solo by controlling both characters at once. If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/994760/extras/coop.gif?t=1588956701\" /></span><br><br><strong>Many open areas to explore:</strong> the ancient temple, the dark caves, the gleaming forest, the snake pit, the death valley, the mummy sanctum, and more.
