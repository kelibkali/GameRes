    "description": "<i>Friday </i><br><br><i>After breakfast, I went to the junk-shop in the old town. <br>I was there by 6 o’clock. <br>It already was dark outside but streets were still crowdy. <br>The junkman met me at the doors. <br>When we came inside he pulled the curtains closed and turned the card now saying “closed” to people outside. <br>There were old brass hookahs, porcelain herdsmen figures and Chinese vases. <br>He left for a few minutes after having sat me down on the sofa, then the owner returned and gave me a parcel – it was wrapped in newspapers. <br>Strongly demanded not to unwrap in front of him. <br>Then I gave the whole sum to the miser and went away. <br>After coming home I’ve locked the door of my cabinet and unwrapped the parcel. <br>It was about 9 p.m. <br>The Cube – undoubtedly it was It. <br>I’ve been chasing it for a long time and looks like I’ve finally made it. <br>It was made of wood and dark metal. <br>I’ve put my gloves on and cut the rope. <br>I was unwrapping it using gloves because I knew how it reacts to a touch of skin. <br>The book says the Cube can affect skin and that means it can both mutilate or heal, but can it heal the hereditary disease of our family? </i><br><br><br><strong>Thank you for supporting Nevrosa!
