    "description": "<strong>The Story</strong><br>The peasants of Nottingham bow under the weight of Prince John’s taxes; nobles fall to the Sheriff’s political machinations; deserters from the Crusades pillage the land; and fairies lure the unwary into the depths of mist-shrouded Sherwood Forest, never to be seen again. <br><br>Step into the chaos of a magical England at the end of the Third Crusade.<br><br>Maid Marian hides breathless amidst the brambles after the sack of her father’s castle; Little John charges a bodyweight in gold to cross a lonely log; and Will Scarlet holds court in a brokedown tower surrounded by trees as tall as the sky, waiting for a king who will never come. <br><br>The time is ripe, a spark is lit – from the ashes of your home, from the shadow of anonymity, step into legend. <br><br>You are Robin Hood.<br><br><strong>The Game</strong><br>Nocked! is a lushly-illustrated, story-driven role-playing game.
