    "description": "In Changes you solve puzzles by pushing cells to reshape the level and reveal latent possibilities. Each level takes place on a grid of cells which follow three rules: cells are born, die, or survive based on how many living cells neighbor them. All the puzzles emerge from these three rules which come together to tell stories about the transformations caused by life and death. Some are tragic, others epic, and a few are pretty cute.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1654920/extras/effa3a1a48aac3a5b0b837045805a4c7.poster.avif?t=1714404421\" width=600 height=250 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1654920/extras/effa3a1a48aac3a5b0b837045805a4c7.webm?t=1714404421\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1654920/extras/effa3a1a48aac3a5b0b837045805a4c7.mp4?t=1714404421\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Each of the puzzles showcases unique and surprising qualities of the system, but they are also fun playgrounds to experiment and discover on your own.
