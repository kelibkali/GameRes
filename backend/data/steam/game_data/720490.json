    "description": "The Floor Is Made of Lava is a game about imagination. <br><br>As Jimmy searches for his brother within his house, his imagination gets carried away and whisks him off on a grand adventure through many worlds. Face off against pirates, escape from stampeding dinosaurs, or take on a proud dragon!<br><br>As a mix of genres somewhere between Mario and Megaman but not quite a Metroidvania, Jimmy will need to defeat bosses in order to gain the equipment they guard. Use these to battle or avoid enemies in new ways or figure out combinations to break through tricky sections of platforming. Most of all, go find those secret paths that you couldn't access earlier! They may lead to interesting upgrades or challenges!<br><br>Not convinced yet? Try the demo for free!<br>",
