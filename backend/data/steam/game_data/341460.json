    "description": "Fallen Temple is a 2-D action RPG inspired by the Zelda series and Diablo 1. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIntroduction <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFallen Temple is a 2-D action RPG that combines the dungeon puzzling of Zelda and the Hack'n'Slash game play of Diablo 1 in a fresh, fast paced 2-D game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are no set classes in the game. The items you chose to wear will determine how you play the game. Use wands and cloth armour to do more damage with spell, use swords and heavy armor to play as a tanky warrior, or a combination of both for a battle mage kind of feel. Level up to level 99. Craft items, weapons, and armour with a in depth but simple crafting system. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are many secrets and hidden areas to be discovered. Find hidden rooms with items and quests.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game has puzzle elements but not to the point where it overwhelms the action gameplay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n*Trailer game play is from an early alpha build.",
