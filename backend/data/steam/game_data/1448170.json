    "description": "In 2082, the human species lives in peace, and its technological and societal evolutions<br />\r\nare exponential.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game series consisting of a season you must be through the eyes of Antoine Harris to a whole future universe of rich science fiction and composed of several stories from the past and the future.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this episode, Mr Harris will see beyond what nature has created, and his worldview will expand to a point that he wouldn't have thought possible, but all this openness will also have its share of doubt and questioning ...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay: The gameplay of EXOTIUM games is reduced to the strict minimum like a walking simulator, so don't expect to play an action game, you will play to discover the history of the characters, through their dialogue and some kinematics, and you will be able to understand the path that humanity took to get to where it is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuration: each episode lasts about 40 minutes like a television series.",
