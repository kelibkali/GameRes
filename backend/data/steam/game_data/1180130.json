It's like watching an ant colony! You can also follow any citizen to make this even more fun. Find the person with the craziest commute, or discover hidden details like a stargazer. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >It's 2142, and earth is a wasteland because of devastating climate change. You built a space ship, but now your food is running out. Fortunately, you see a world just in time. It is a bit small, but certainly better than nothing. You build some farms and houses, and fulfill the basic needs of your citizens. Then, it's time to build the true city of the future! Research advanced technology and make your city grow to a huge metropolis. When your tiny world gets too small, fly to other worlds with space ships, or even build teleporters.</p>",
