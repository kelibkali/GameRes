An individual by the name of Mr. Mitchell has his whole community fooled that he's this respectable golf coach at some fancy club.

Now, wouldn't it be fair if we got our hands on some of that?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/441600/extras/562b048ab287d8916947fd1e639108ed.avif?t=1756114300\" width=616 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>Nothing Is Certain but Death and Taxes</strong> – We are doing things a bit differently this time. There is this shady taxman who is out to make a $25,000,000 deal with some big corporation, but we're going to stop it from going through, you understand? Alex is helping us out with this one, making sure we can get our hands on this taxman and force him to give us the server and codes we're after. He might not be cooperative at first, so you will just have to use any means necessary to convince him, right?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/441600/extras/c185feb899ed53d62ebf4a6193c7ef3b.avif?t=1756114300\" width=616 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>2 New Songs Added</strong> Two remixes of two classics - enjoy Simon Viklunds new 2016 renditions of Home Invasion and Three Way deal!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/441600/extras/38438789f42df11180f218846da60501.avif?t=1756114300\" width=616 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>A New Secondary Grenade Launcher</strong> – A secondary grenade launcher called the China Puff 40mm Grenade Launcher is added to the game.

The time and effort it takes to create four melee weapons we instead put into the creation of one. The first result of this new approach is The Pounder, Wolf's favorite nailgun. When people ask about the name Wolf is quick to correct it to &quot;The Punder&quot; and as they say that he screams: &quot;Nailed it!&quot;<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/441600/extras/781317fdd84a6c5f58630e6049dfad4f.avif?t=1756114300\" width=616 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>4 New Masks</strong> – Hans, Trickster Demon, the Dragon Head and the Viking have been added, inspired by Wolf's personal interests.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/441600/extras/15b5dd994796f3b25c9eaad61f3a4971.avif?t=1756114300\" width=616 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>4 New Patterns</strong> –  Four new patterns have been added as part of the Wolf Pack DLC, inspired by Wolf.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/441600/extras/476412fd1d0af2f7789d71fa05a6f32a.avif?t=1756114300\" width=616 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>4 New Materials</strong> – Four new materials have been added as part of the Wolf Pack DLC, inspired by Wolf.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/441600/extras/c0d072c07a2b9089a1896adc727255e6.avif?t=1756114300\" width=616 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>10 New Achievements</strong> – 10 new achievements have been added with some classic ones from the original heists making a return as well.",
