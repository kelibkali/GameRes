The Kingdoms of Kush, Saba and Nabatea fall under the African/Arabian subculture, while the Masaesyli are of Numidian origin. <br><br>These factions are native to the deserts of Africa and Arabia. Surviving these harsh environmental conditions has forged them into hardy warriors who use the shifting desert sands to their advantage in battle. <br><br>While culturally similar, each faction boasts unique new unit rosters which offer different military strengths. Each faction also has new building chains and technology trees, playing to their strengths and further differentiating their playstyles.<br><br>Alongside their individual Faction Traits, the Desert Kingdoms all share the following Cultural Traits:<br><br><strong>Desert Warriors:</strong> +10% morale for all units during battles in the desert<br><strong>Deep-rooted Traditions:</strong> Penalty to research rate<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Meroe (The Kingdom of Kush)</strong></h2> <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/792520/extras/e807308adc780152fe7fd18417eff366.poster.avif?t=1764166915\" width=624 height=204 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/792520/extras/e807308adc780152fe7fd18417eff366.webm?t=1764166915\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/792520/extras/e807308adc780152fe7fd18417eff366.mp4?t=1764166915\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>A major regional power with vast resources derived from its trade in gold, jewels and exotic hides, Kush has been overshadowed by its more powerful and famous northern neighbour, Egypt. <br><br>In the early 3rd century BC, king Ergamenes decided to wrest power away from the priests of Amun, and moved the capital from Napata to Meroe. The priests would no longer decide the fate of the kings and queens.<br><br>The shift of capital also marked something of a break from Egyptian culture with Hellenistic, Indian, Persian and African influences making their way through the trade routes. The kings and warrior queens would sit on the throne and rule with authority and conviction to protect the riches of Nubia. Even the Romans could not conquer Meroe, and preferred to trade instead.<br><br>A regional powerhouse with a surfeit of natural treasures and fertile land, Kush is well equipped to prosper and once again vie for power against the mightiest empires in the world. <br><br><strong>Key Features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Affinity for Egyptian/Hellenistic culture<br></li><li>Higher probability of female characters in politics<br></li><li>Trading kingdom (ivory, exotic hides, iron, gold)</li></ul><br><strong>Faction Traits:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Disciplined Workforce: Bonus income from slaves, reduction in slave decline, Reduced Public Order penalty from slaves.<br></li><li>The Land of the Bow: cheaper, better archer units.</li></ul><br><strong>Kush Unit Roster:</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Melee Infantry:</h2>T1: Slave Infantry<br>T2: Swordsmen<br>T2: Kushite Slave Infantry<br>T3: Shotel Warriors<br>T4: Armoured Shotel Warriors<br>T4: Disciples of Apedemak<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Spear Infantry:</h2>T1: Nubian Spearmen<br>T2: Kushite Slave Spearmen<br>T3: Leopard Warriors<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Pike Infantry:</h2>T2: Kushite Pikes<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Missile Infantry:</h2>T1: Tribesmen<br>T1: Slave Slingers<br>T2: Nubian Bowmen<br>T2: Archers<br>T3: Kushite Archers<br>T4: Royal Kushite Archers<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Melee Cavalry:</h2>T2: Aethiopian Cavalry<br>T2: Desert Cavalry<br>T3: Armoured Desert Cavalry<br>T4: Kushite Royal Guard<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Special:</h2>T2: Desert Chariots<br>T3: African Elephants<br>T4: African War Elephants<br>T4: Scythed Chariots<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Nabatae</strong></h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/792520/extras/6a97de1c6835e9c2c5d2ad3af64c7a15.poster.avif?t=1764166915\" width=624 height=204 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/792520/extras/6a97de1c6835e9c2c5d2ad3af64c7a15.webm?t=1764166915\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/792520/extras/6a97de1c6835e9c2c5d2ad3af64c7a15.mp4?t=1764166915\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>The Nabataeans were great builders and pioneers of advanced construction techniques. They were the first civilization to use cement extensively, and built remarkable watertight reservoirs, ensuring a plentiful supply of potable water. Even when under threat from powerful foes like the Seleucids and Judeans, their progressive society enabled them to flourish and prosper.<br><br>The Nabataeans were very literate and had a remarkable degree of gender equality for an ancient civilization, with women participating in both political and religious matters. Nabatae was an important crossroad for the spice trade, serving as a conduit between the southern kingdoms that produced frankincense and myrrh, and the wealthy eastern and western empires who were its primary buyers. <br><br>Preserving all this wealth at such a geographically strategic location demanded a well-trained military and a strong navy. Nabatae had both, bolstered by excellent engineering and exploitation of the surrounding environment, making their capital city of Petra a nigh-impregnable bastion.<br><br><strong>Key Features:</strong> <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Hellenic influence: may recruit Hellenic-themed units for battle<br></li><li>Silk road traders: Bonus to trade and diplomacy<br></li><li>Skilled masons: bonuses to construction and fortification <br></li><li>Friends of Rome: diplomatic bonus with Roman factions/allies <br></li><li>Roman tactics: some native units may use Roman army formations/abilities</li></ul> <br><strong>Faction Traits:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Stonecutters: Faster, cheaper construction of main settlement-chain buildings<br></li><li>Incense Traders: Bonus income from incense trade</li></ul> <br><strong>Nabatae Unit Roster:</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Melee Infantry:</h2>T1: Desert Levy<br>T2: Nabataean Swordsmen<br>T2: Nabataean Axe Warriors<br>T3: Noble Swordsmen<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Spear Infantry:</h2>T1: Levy Spearmen<br>T2: Caravan Guard<br>T2: Desert Hoplites<br>T3: Armoured Desert Hoplites<br>T3: Heavy Desert Spearmen<br>T4: Rekem Palace Guard<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Pike Infantry:</h2>T2: Desert Pikemen<br>T3: Nabataean Thorax Pike<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Missile Infantry:</h2>T1: Slingers<br>T1: Levy Skirmishers<br>T2: Tribespeople<br>T3 Nabataean Light Peltasts<br>T3: Nabataean Heavy Archers<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Shock Cavalry:</h2>T3: Desert Heavy Lancers<br>T4: Hellenic Desert Cataphracts<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Melee Cavalry:</h2>T1: Desert Cavalry<br>T2: Camel Spearmen<br>T2: Arabian Cavalry<br>T3: Armoured Desert Cavalry<br>T3: Nabataean Noble Cavalry<br>T3: Armoured Camel Spearmen<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Missile Cavalry:</h2>T2: Camel Archers<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Special:</h2>T2: Desert Chariots<br>T4: Scythed Chariots<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Saba</strong></h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/792520/extras/6889f0be1408d2c367288236583a892a.poster.avif?t=1764166915\" width=624 height=204 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/792520/extras/6889f0be1408d2c367288236583a892a.webm?t=1764166915\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/792520/extras/6889f0be1408d2c367288236583a892a.mp4?t=1764166915\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>The Sabaean kingdom lies in the harsh lands of the southern Arabian Peninsula. Even in such inhospitable conditions, however, these ingenious people thrived. They built dams, invented new irrigation techniques and became masters of water-efficiency. The Sabaeans were also excellent sailors, and had strong trade relations with peoples across the Red Sea. <br><br>Not warlike by nature, the Sabaeans charged mercenaries with the protection of their trade routes and caravans. That said, they were a resilient people of tough character, who made formidable foes for anyone who dared threaten their great capital city of Marib.

Both were skilled warriors and there were many rivalries between them.<br><br>The Massyli had strong relations with Carthage, a key reason for the Massaesyli aligning with Rome when the opportunity came. Through many twists and turns, both tribes ultimately unified into theK kingdom of Numidia, under the Massylian king Massinissa. He ruled for an astonishing 54 years, transforming his kingdom into a prospering North African power.<br><br><strong>Key Features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Affinity to Cartage and Latin culture<br></li><li>Extensive Roman influence in battle<br></li><li>Cavalry-focused faction</li></ul>  <br><strong>Faction traits</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Desert Ambushers: +50%  chance of successfully launching an ambush</li></ul><br><strong>Numidia Unit Roster:</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Melee Infantry:</h2>T1: Slave Infantry<br>T2: Numidian Light Infantry<br>T2: Gaetuli Tribesmen<br>T3: Desert Legionaries<br>T3: Desert Cohort<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Spear Infantry:</h2>T1: Numidian Spearmen<br>T2: Desert Vigiles<br>T3: Armoured Numidian Spears<br>T4: Numidian Noble Infantry<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Missile Infantry:</h2>T1: Tribesmen<br>T1: Tribal Slingers<br>T2: Numidian Javelinmen<br>T3: Heavy Numidian Skirmishers<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Shock Cavalry:</h2>T2: Numidian Riders<br>T3: Armoured Numidian Riders<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Melee Cavalry:</h2>T2: Desert Cavalry<br>T3: Armoured Desert Cavalry<br>T3: Desert Legionary Cavalry<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Missile Cavalry:</h2>T1: Gaetuli Horse Skirmishers<br>T2: Numidian Cavalry<br>T3: Armoured Numidian Cavalry<br>T4: Numidian Noble Cavalry<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Special:</h2>T2: Desert Chariots<br>T3: Armoured Desert Chariots<br>T4: African Elephants",
