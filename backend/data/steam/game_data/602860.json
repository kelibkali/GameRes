    "description": "The Boshin War was a civil war in Japan, fought from 1868 to 1869 between Tokugawa bakufu and pro-imperial forces. An alliance of southern samurai (domains of Choshu and Satsuma) secured control of the imperial court. The house of Tokugawa launched a military campaign to seize the emperor's court at Kyoto, but defeated in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi. Troops loyal to the bakufu tried to regroup at Osaka Castle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreate your fleet and army, hunt the enemy's fleet, hide your weak squadrons in protected ports until reinforcements arrive, blockade enemy trade routes, amphibious assaults and harbour sieges, struggle for dominance over the seas in turned-based strategic mode - All of these actions are possible in Ironclads 2 Boshin War.
