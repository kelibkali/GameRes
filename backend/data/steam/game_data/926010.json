You can play the first single player mission (more will be added during Early Access), Dogfight, PvE or multiplayer with up to 10 players, in different free for all gamemodes. At the moment this game has 9 gamemodes, including: standard free for all, gungame, sniper, shotgun and pistol-only, a realistic, no HUD mode and more. <br><br>You can choose from a wide variety of weapons, divided in 5 different catagories. By playing with a weapon, you get upgrade points for that specific weapon to improve your weapon statistics. For certain weapons you can buy optics or silencers. You can also buy weapon skins in the shop, when you have reached player level 3. Skins, weapons and weapon attachments can only be bought with in-game money.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/926010/extras/6dfbb0a66182fb4e9a6bd394bc0bd49c.avif?t=1569580072\" width=590 height=438 /></span><br><br>There are 18 different perks to choose from, to make your character the way you want. Playing well will be rewarded with killstreaks, like a radar, a bomber plane or a bomb you can control falling down on the map. Also, the higher your killstreak is, the stronger your soldier will get. For example faster sprint speed, and a little bit more health.<br><br>You can play on 12 different maps, set on all kinds of different locations. Operation Lone Wolf has small and fast paced maps, and big, more open maps for a little bit more tactical gameplay, so there are many gameplay options available for the players. Post launch updates like new maps, new gamemodes etc. will all be free, and there are no in-game purchases or lootboxes in Operation Lone Wolf. You can also play offline with bots, to test your skills and improve in the game, or play without an internet connection.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/926010/extras/1b6359a477b6a758e8a38aac45decf79.avif?t=1569580072\" width=590 height=278 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Early Access</h2>All the things above are already in the game at the moment.
