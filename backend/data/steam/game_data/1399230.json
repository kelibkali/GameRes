    "description": "WELCOME TO HOOVERNAUTS!!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlotline:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLegions of hostile space creatures are chomping at the bit to break through Earth's atmosphere and make our planet their own. You have been enlisted to join the Hoovernauts - an elite team of combat specialists operating in space and led by a military general known only by his code name: Hoover. It's your job to protect the planet, invade hostile space bases, and train against other Hoovernauts. The universe will never be the same.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat to expect in the game:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- campaign mode level 1 with 4 difficulties: easy, medium, hard, and bonus<br />\r\n- campaign mode level 2 with 1 difficulty<br />\r\n- arena mode (player vs. player) where you can battle friends and/or CPUs<br />\r\n- local multiplayer support for all game modes (1-4 players)<br />\r\n- special abilities such as overshields and jetpacks<br />\r\n- weapons such as the laser beamer and laser pistol<br />\r\n- powerups such as upgraded armor and enhanced ability<br />\r\n- space enemies such as the alien spaceship, flaming skull, mothership, and shadow<br />\r\n<br />\r\nImportant Notes:<br />\r\n- a game remote such as an Xbox One controller is required for each player<br />\r\n- connection to the Internet is not necessary<br />\r\n- the game is not complete; updates are likely to come in the future which will offer more levels, special abilities, and powerups<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, the game was entirely developed by one person: Reid Wilson (a college student who created the game just for fun). It is not going to be Steam's #1 best-selling game, but it will give players the opportunity to have lots of fun by themselves or with friends. Thank you and please enjoy the game!",
