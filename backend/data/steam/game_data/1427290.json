    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About This Game</h2>You are just a peasant living day to day eating slimes in <i>Jiguland</i>. One day, the president puts up a bounty on the local evil lord. This is your chance to flip your life around.<br><br><i>Jiguland</i> is an open world roguelike rpg in a twisted mix of medieval modern life.<br>The crazy insurance and food costs as well as the lack of real jobs in <i>Jiguland</i> will constantly get in your way as you struggle to level up to kill the evil lord. <br>Do whatever it costs to survive and prosper - Befriend the insurance agent, possess and live as a dog, clone the pawnbroker, turn the golem into a slime... You will find that honest work will not get you far in <i>Jiguland</i>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Combat</h2>Tactically place yourself according to landscape and enemy disposition to ensure survival in combat. <br>Use the lighting to your advantage - darkness hinders the vision range of you and your enemies. <br>Pay attention to the direction that your enemies are facing - if they are turned away from you, the only way for them to notice you is your footstep sound. <br>As the game progresses, you must also learn different skills that change combat dramatically. <br>Even with the perfect tactical skills, you will be subject to repercussions of bad strategy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Controls</h2>Use WASD keys to move. <br>Use SPACE key to attack. <br>Use Q to drop or pick up items. <br>Use TAB to access menu and close the dialog.<br><br>You can enter tutorial in game. <br>You may modify keymap.txt in the game directory to change keys. <br>Further controls and mechanisms may be revealed as you play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Game Contents</h2>Depending on your skill level, your first victory may take more than 100 hours. Once you know what you are doing, a single victory run takes about 4 hours. <br><br>There are 5 attributes to level up - Vitality, Strength, Stealth, Intelligence, and Charisma. Playthroughs will differ dramatically depending on your build.<br>There are 100+ enemies, 100+ various items, 30+ weapons, 50+ equipment, 30+ game changing skills, 30+ unique spells, and 25 wandering unique mobs. <br>Currently the game map consists of about 100000 tiles. <br>There are 6 procedurally generated dungeons. <br>While the map is static, the biomes are random, so objects spawning on the map will be different each playthrough.",
