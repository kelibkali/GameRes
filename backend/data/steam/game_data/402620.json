These &quot;kindred spirits&quot; died with unrequited feelings in their hearts, met, and fell in love. They hold an ardent wish to experience their &quot;first time&quot; together before their eternal rest...But they don't know how.<br><br>The two haunting spirits enlist Yuna to help them foster more &quot;yuri&quot; couples at the school, to assist girls struggling with their hidden feelings, and with the hope that their successes will help them glean the insight they need.",
