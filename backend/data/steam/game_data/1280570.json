He saved countless lives and helped rid the evil of the land with his powerful blade and untouched bravery. The King, needing someone familiar with the ways of the Arcane, recruited Ash's brother Will to help maintain peace in Geldia. Eventually the King's true intentions were shown and the King, along with the castle, were destroyed by the dark magic of Llarm.<br><br>It's been a long time since the powerful wizard Llarm almost brought calamity upon the land of Geldia. We can only think it was because of the Hero of Geldia himself, Ash. He chased the evil wizard into the forest, there was a bright light, and the sky became clear. Nobody dared to go and find out what happened in fear of what they might find. That is of course, until a very greedy Hotdog decided to go look for himself. All that they found was a Marshmallow with a sword and shield.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1280570/extras/cd1e295ae9eef1014b2762dcd8482bb2.poster.avif?t=1752638971\" width=500 height=280 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1280570/extras/cd1e295ae9eef1014b2762dcd8482bb2.webm?t=1752638971\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1280570/extras/cd1e295ae9eef1014b2762dcd8482bb2.mp4?t=1752638971\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>When Marshall wakes up, They have no recollection of why they were there or who they are.
