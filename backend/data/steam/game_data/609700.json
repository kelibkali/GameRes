They are tasked with finding &quot;Sticky Jack&quot;, a thief that has crossed Leary by pulling three recent robberies without paying his cut. Jack was last seen after he made his thefts at the Miskatonic University. The players must find Jack or face the wrath of Mordecai and his claw hammer.</i><br>This is a short investigation  suitable for new or seasoned investigators, but is weighted towards new groups. It includes six pre-generated characters and portraits.<br>By Mike Mason, Scott Dorward, and Paul Fricker.
