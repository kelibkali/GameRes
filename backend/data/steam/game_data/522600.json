    "description": "Locomancer is a virtual reality model/toy train simulator. Its goal is to replicate the tactile nature of a building a model train layout by hand while not requiring the space or monetary investment that a real layout would. Plus, once you've built your layout, you can drive around it in first person!<br><br>Locomancer is still in development so this demo is currently more about features than it is about content. This means that the art is rough and the available locomotives, cars, and scenery are limited, but will increase over time.<br><br>Current features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The standard rail pieces you would expect in a train set<br></li><li> A growing number of locomotives and rail cars<br></li><li> One workshop background environment<br></li><li> Multiple tables that can be placed in your workshop as you see fit<br></li><li> Remote and in-cab loco driving<br></li><li> Subway tunnels (though no way to go from topside to the upside down)<br></li><li> Minimal sound effects<br></li><li> Programmer art!</li></ul><br>Planned features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> More rails<br></li><li> More locos/cars<br></li><li> More background environments<br></li><li> Workshop and custom model support<br></li><li> Civilians that ride your trains<br></li><li> Logic blocks that allow automating layouts<br></li><li> Deformable terrain<br></li><li> Music<br></li><li> Better art!<br></li><li> Online multiplayer<br></li><li> Support for non-VR setups</li></ul>",
