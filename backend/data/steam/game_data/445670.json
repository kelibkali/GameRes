Venture deep into uncharted space and explore the hell out of it!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Stargazers is about giant robots, star ships and the relationship between three girls. Inspired by 50s and 80s Scifi, Pulp Fiction, and Mecha anime! The Stargazers is a self contained story, and while we’re open to the idea of making more stories in the future, we’re designing Stargazers around self-contained adventures for the Stargazers Squadron in the style of pulp fiction.
