Set out on a quest full of mysteries to unravel: Why does the ancient game board in the Slumberwoods work only for you? What does the Elder know about it? Who was that guy they call the ‘Wizard’, and could he maybe still exist?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Class Selection</h2>At the start of the game, choose between two classes with different skills and, occasionally, slightly different events taking place in the game world. Do you want to get up-close and personal as a Fighter, dual-wielding electrified viking blades, or play the supporter’s role of a Tinker, healing and buffing your robotic allies? It’s up to you!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Character Customisation</h2>Configure the skill setups of your actors whenever you like!
