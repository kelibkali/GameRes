If you like those games, we are making Quest of Souls for you!<br><br>We are planning for three player co-op, three levels of difficulty (Casual, Normal, and Insano), 7 full levels in game, and secret unlockable story twists and characters!<br><br>The core of combat is an action packed twin-stick shooter. You dodge enemy projectiles while using each of the character's four abilities to get to the end of the level. As the game progresses you make decisions in the story that lead you down different paths. Each of those paths have their own encounters, enemies, and unlockable skill upgrade books used to enhance and customize each character's abilities. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/441560/extras/e75e85f2fe6bd93d0df9db25101bdf25.avif?t=1487655454\" width=555 height=74 /></span><br><br>The storyline revolves around three main characters: Brunhilde the Good Lich, Toki the Dragonslayer, and Yoshimbo the Sworn Protector, and their quest to track down a powerful magical artifact of great value that was stolen by a mysterious dark sorcerer.<br><br>Their trek takes them across a wondrous fantasy landscape boasting vastly different environments to explore and decisions that change not just the story, but the actual levels themselves!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/441560/extras/3b77e133ea4c363ac821b8227d3bc1f9.avif?t=1487655454\" width=555 height=74 /></span><br><br>Wait, you said a lich, a dragonslayer, and a Yoshimbo?!<br><br>Yep.
