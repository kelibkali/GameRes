A place that will give you a lot of fun!</h2><br><strong><i>In Train Station Renovation you play as a renovation company specialised in restoring railway stations. The game is set in abandoned and destroyed train stations, you will start with small rural ones to ease in and eventually be challenged with sprawling train stations in metropolitan areas. The game is divided into 10 maps (stations) which gradually teach you new mechanics and help you manage different working environments. Each station needs to be cleaned, fixed and decorated with items and equipment to bring it back to life. </i></strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1281080/extras/9b1eeba784a16d06289292a3e74da1ec.poster.avif?t=1672837774\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1281080/extras/9b1eeba784a16d06289292a3e74da1ec.webm?t=1672837774\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1281080/extras/9b1eeba784a16d06289292a3e74da1ec.mp4?t=1672837774\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Choose how hard you want to work.</strong><br>The level of difficulty depends on the player's commitment.
