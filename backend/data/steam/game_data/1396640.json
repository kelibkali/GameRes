    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > Starfinder RPG - Devastation Ark AP 3: Dominion's End</h2>Upon gaining access to the hostile starship known as Ark Prime, the heroes find themselves immersed in propaganda designed to show the might and superiority of the ancient empire that launched the vessel eons ago. Once they break free of the brainwashing, they can fight past robots, holographic constructs, and alien supersoldiers awoken from stasis to confront Ark Prime's evil AI.
