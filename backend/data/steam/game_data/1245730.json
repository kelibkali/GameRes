    "description": "Chuck Meowrris is a Roguelike/Roguelite/whatever this genre is. You have nine lives to complete the game and get through nine different levels. Every time you complete three levels, you face a boss. Every time you lose a life or complete a level you move to one the nine levels that you haven't completed at random. You can play as five different classes however, the class you play as is actually chosen for you instead of you choosing it. Nine lives, nine levels, three bosses, and one final boss. Can you complete Dr. Kibblesworth's Gauntlet of Randomness?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you run into any bugs or concerns with the game, feel free to email me at whynotfailagain@gmail.com about them!",
