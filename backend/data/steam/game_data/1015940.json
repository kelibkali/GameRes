An apprenticeship as a carpenter, a group of new, complicated friends, and a town predisposed to all kinds of difficult relationships. But they're going to find their way just like all the other off-beat immigrants to the island of Elk.

Whether it's playing cards for candy, getting their feet wet at the beach or just sitting down to listen to a story well-told, Elk will be an adventure that Frigg will cherish for the rest of their days.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1015940/extras/1d1986a718d57315f0fa33dfca993b39.poster.avif?t=1751348041\" width=600 height=120 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1015940/extras/1d1986a718d57315f0fa33dfca993b39.webm?t=1751348041\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1015940/extras/1d1986a718d57315f0fa33dfca993b39.mp4?t=1751348041\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>The stories in Welcome to Elk are told by the people who we know and/or were there when the events took place. All are told from memory. The way they are used both on our webpage and in the game is true to the core story but everything like names, locations and other details are changed, renamed and often re-framed to protect the real people behind them, therefore, we call them tall tales. The stories are not one-to-one like you would experience in true crime for example. They are rewritten and combined to one linear narrative. Characters may play a role in one story where they were not a part of it originally and only us who designed it will ever know – or come close to the real truth of the stories.<br><br>Welcome to Elk might look like a “fun” game but it’s about telling stories – some are filled with humour, others are dark, but they go hand in hand.",
