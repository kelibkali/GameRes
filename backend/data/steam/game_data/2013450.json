    "description": "While investigating what happened to the Lava River, Charlie discovers that it's blocked by a sleeping Samovar. Help Selen, the brave little teacup, wake up Mr Samovar, in order to allow the lava salmon to come back to the lake.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A taste of what's coming</h2>This demo happens roughly in the middle of the story. It's made of just one scene. Enough to give you a taste of what's coming, and tickle your curiosity, while leaving a lot of unanswered questions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A simple point &amp; click</h2>Asfalia is focused on the narration. Just click to move or interact and let the story unfold. A few simple puzzles will get in the way, but won't stop you for long... hopefully.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >More than just a game</h2>Before anything, Asfalia is a children's tale about emotions. But it also opens up a space to discover emotions on a deeper level. The full version of Asfalia will come with extra .pdf contents to allow parents and educators to use the game as a tool for emotional awakening. Those include thematic cards and group activities around the game and emotions.",
