    "description": "PLEASE NOTE: SETVR is currently in Alpha, this means that we have functionally completed the core features however the application still needs updates for: usability (instructions), repeatability (replayable features), and variability (new content). We hope for SETVR to be fully released in 2022!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you,<br />\r\nSETVR Team<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSETVR is a self-defense enhancement training virtual reality platform that allows martial arts/self-defense practitioners the ability to train their muscle memory and reaction time for hand to hand combat situations through virtual aggressor assault scenarios. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMartial arts and self-defense practitioners aren't always able to practice their skills whether it's due to not having a sparring partner, not having a suitable space, or not being able to find the time to train. Not training can lead to lowered Muscle Memory and Reaction Time which, in a combat scenario could lead to undesired outcomes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith SETVR users can practice their martial arts and self-defense skills at any location, any time, with or without anyone. Users can improve their reaction time and muscle memory through virtual reality aggressor assault simulations. This allows for continual improvement of self-defense ability through dedicated practice of movements and neutralizations on a virtual combatant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeep Track of your progress through User Metrics! Dodge, Block, and Punch to progress your training. Check previous days' metrics with a new Calendar view.",
