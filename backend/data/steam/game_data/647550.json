    "description": "Living the Deal is a business management life-sim. Rise from nothing into a trading tycoon and attempt to maintain your welbeing in the process.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nTime is your main resource, so manage it effectively. Will you take an hour to walk to work? Or call a cab and get there fast so you can sneak in a quick breakfast before that big meeting? You won’t be able to focus on your meeting if you’re hungry...<br />\r\n <br />\r\nSpend your time poorly and your well-being will suffer. We all love money and success, but it won’t end well if you neglect yourself.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nAchieve the balance though, and you’ll reap the rewards of a healthy business. Make the right contacts, be smart about your investments and walk away from each business deal with more money than sense. The next question is, will you keep your new earnings in the business or live vicariously spending it on frivolous items for yourself. After all, that new games console will make you happy, won’t it?<br />\r\n <br />\r\nIn Living the Deal, the choice is up to you. Make deals, get rich, or die trying.",
