    "description": "This DLC unlocks <strong>all the maps</strong> for Retro Commander. Maps are added and updated regularly, so instead of adding them to the DLC itself, they are downloaded from within the game. In particular, the DLC give access to the following.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>All the maps with their scenarios (including player-modded maps).<br></li><li>All the campaign missions including the official campaign.<br></li><li>Includes current and upcoming maps that are not released yet.<br></li><li>Can be used in single player or multiplayer games including LAN games.<br></li><li>Allows uploading your map for others to play.<br></li><li>No login is required to download the maps from within the game (you need internet still).<br></li><li>No DRM: you can play offline (make sure you download the maps beforehand!).<br></li><li><u>WARNING</u>: the DLC only works via Steam. If you want to play cross-platform, get the corresponding In-App purchase &quot;All Maps &amp; Modding&quot; and it will work on other devices also.</li></ul><br><u>IMPORTANT</u>: if you already purchased &quot;All Maps &amp; Modding&quot; within the game, you do NOT need to buy the DLC also. Both are the same. The game will prevent you from purchasing the DLC from within the game. It's not possible to do so on the DLC web page however. That said, there will a warning in-game if it finds you have it twice telling you to get a refund.",
