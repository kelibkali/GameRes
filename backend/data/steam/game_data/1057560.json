The top down camera and twin stick shooter controls makes it easy to just pick up and play however the fast-paced nature of the game gives it a high skill ceiling. Players can team up and play against each other both online and offline with any combination of maps, Mutators, and gamemodes. <br><br><strong>Mutators:</strong> Mutators greatly change up the rules of Rebound Dodgeball Evolved by changing the behaviour of the dodgeballs or through adding new abilities. Instead of dodgeballs slowing down over time, Nitro Ball speeds the ball up with each collision resulting in a hectic game that only gets more dangerous over time.  Time Glitch throws a spanner in the works by sending everyone back in time to where they were shortly before, pay attention and you can save your past self from a dodgeball!<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1057560/extras/eb32c164bc3eca2b9f2ad287e301cb5c.poster.avif?t=1575046871\" width=500 height=374 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1057560/extras/eb32c164bc3eca2b9f2ad287e301cb5c.webm?t=1575046871\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1057560/extras/eb32c164bc3eca2b9f2ad287e301cb5c.mp4?t=1575046871\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Maps:</strong> With over 15 unique maps you must adapt quickly to take advantage of the new geometry and stage hazards to ensure the win.
