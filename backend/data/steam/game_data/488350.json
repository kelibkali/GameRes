    "description": "<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>🗨 Is there a new version of the game being created?</strong></h2>Yes! Since the rushed and unlucky initial launch on Steam in 2018, we’ve been constantly putting a lot of effort into building the game that had been promised to our community. The Karters have been basically reworked from the ground up for 4 years and we decided to release the new version as <strong>The Karters 2: Turbo Charged</strong> you can <strong>wishlist on Steam</strong>. Importantly, the concepts and vision standing behind the new version have not been lost but rather improved upon so you can expect a well-polished, ultimately functional, visually pleasing and super fun kart racing game we’ve always been aiming to create!<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>🗨 What if I already have an old (2018) version of the game?</strong></h2>All the players who purchased the old version of the game before January 4th, 2023 will receive a free copy of <strong>The Karters 2: Turbo Charged</strong> . Wishlist the new version to stay up to date and get a notification because at the beginning of 2023 we will start Beta Tests that you can sign up to!<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Enjoyable Singleplayer</strong></h2>The singleplayer experience is really important to us as we would love to bring back the times when the player had to go through each track, unlock its secrets or simply play a track and show your friends who has got the best time. Play through the Adventure and challenge your friends in the Arcade. Remember, if you are tired of getting hit by that pesky rocket you can race your friends in our Speed mode - only pure skill matters!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Online Multiplayer</strong></h2>Join the competitive online multiplayer. If you have what it takes, do not hesitate to show your skills to the entire world, but beware, you will be putting your drifting ability to the most difficult test! Can't get your friends to play locally? Invite them over and play to your heart's content. You got those buddies at your home? Play split-screen multiplayer online together!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Split-screen/ Split-Screen Multiplayer</strong></h2>Play with up to 6 of your friends in split-screen. The more the merrier; let the old-school couch party make a dramatic comeback as you race against your friends for that everlasting glory. We're bringing back those neighborhood rivalries so you can relive the nostalgia once again! Bring your friends and battle it out for old times sake!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/488350/extras/3e2ca01a81691f6d876351adc6365442.poster.avif?t=1673407012\" width=600 height=94 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/488350/extras/3e2ca01a81691f6d876351adc6365442.webm?t=1673407012\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/488350/extras/3e2ca01a81691f6d876351adc6365442.mp4?t=1673407012\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Message from the Developers:</strong></h2>As great fans of Crash Team Racing, we used to wonder what this game would look like in modern times. While browsing through various forums about CTR, it became clear to us that the community shares our desire for a more up-to-date karting game, especially the one that would support online multiplayer. In The Karters, we are trying to bridge the gap that CTR has left. We realize that Crash Team Racing is a legend that set the bar high. However, by putting a strong emphasis on the mechanics and marking the game with its unique style, we do hope The Karters will bring players lots of joy and pure fun.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>About the Developers:</strong></h2><br>Pixel Edge Games is an indie studio from Poland, having a highly successful track record of mobile VR games like Racket Fury: Table Tennis VR. We are now bringing our second game on the PC!",
