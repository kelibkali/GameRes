After a ritual gone wrong, the newbie shrine maiden Sanae awakes in a world of fantasy. With only the storms to guide her, Sanae sets off to scale a towering mountain in search of answers. Explore vibrant landscapes, out-smart troublesome enemies, and take town powerful bosses as you venture into the lands of Gensokyo.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/810780/extras/b3a4818a71b4f7c3fe4aed9c960f3d9b.avif?t=1528081660\" width=526 height=168 /></span><br><br>If you've never heard of Touhou, don't worry! RAIN Project will provide a warm welcome for newcomers to the series. We hope to build a world where anyone can jump in and immerse themselves in the fantasies of Gensokyo as they play.<br><br>If you're a Touhou veteran, then welcome back. RAIN Project is a re-imagination of the Touhou formula as a 2D platformer. Get ready to experience boss fights, spell cards, and beautiful danmaku. RAIN Project takes place before the events of <i>Mountain of Faith</i> -- Sanae arrives in Gensokyo, only to find her memories lost and the gods of Moriya shrine out of control! Can Sanae cast away her common sense and regain control of Youkai mountain?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/810780/extras/83fbd3ebeaf81c78af1bc2965f2a94cd.avif?t=1528081660\" width=526 height=168 /></span><br><br>Gensokyo is a land of fantasy and adventure, and we've built a world to show this off.
