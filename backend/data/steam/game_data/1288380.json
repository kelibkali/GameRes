    "description": "It's not easy being a hero, especially if your city already has a superhero. Especially if that superhero has super strength and can fly! But what happens when a bunch of evil-doers with the power to glitch out reality itself take over a building, grab a few hostages and manage to overpower said superhero?<br>Well, it is up to YOU, of course, to step up and prove to everyone that you are more than just a two-bit hero! Are you up to the task?<br><br>-------------------------------<br><br>Two Bit Hero is a classic retro metroidvania - a retroidvania if you will - that sees you taking on the role of hero. Citizens have been trapped inside a skyscraper and you have to get in, power up, defeat the bad guys, save the people and get out again. But be careful when you encounter a glitch in reality, for it will transport you to a different reality altogether! But perhaps you can use that to your advantage?<br><br>Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Handcrafted Experience - Nothing is random<br></li><li>Two large maps to explore - They are the same and yet different<br></li><li>Carefully balanced gameplay - You'll have to glitch between both realities to progress<br></li><li>Power up your character by collecting items spread throughout both maps<br></li><li>Retro look and feel - Includes chiptune music by Trevor Lentz (X-O Planets, Citadale, Neon.Code)<br></li><li>Easy mode for newcomers to the genre<br></li><li>Three different endings</li></ul><br>-------------------------------<br>Controller Information:<br>This game is compatible with a wide range of gamepads. However, due to limitations with the engine, some controllers may not work properly. There is, unfortunately, nothing I can do about that. Should you have any trouble with your gamepad, maybe try another gamepad or use the keyboard. I apologize for the inconvenience.",
