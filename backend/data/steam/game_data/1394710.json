    "description": "In Super Kayak Demo you are steering a kayak through a river cluttered with obstacles. You have to reach your campsite without loosing any of your stuff! Oh and avoid those rocks, they will destroy your boat if you hit them too hard...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt sounds easy and looks kinda slow, but making a well controlled run is actually quite hard. Try it yourself with this demo! You get the same features as the full game but are restricted to three demo levels. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnjoy the scenic river, but always be alert!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Paddle your kayak down a river<br />\r\n- Don't lose any of your items<br />\r\n- Don't crash into rocks<br />\r\n- Beat levels &amp; make it to the high score!",
