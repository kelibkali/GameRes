We self-published our first game The Room on iPad in September 2012 and were stunned with both the critical success and our new-found fan-base, not to mention multiple international awards. The Room games have since changed our lives and we hope you enjoy our Virtual Reality take on the series.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1104380/extras/2643c36e13287870ca1109797ab99492.poster.avif?t=1646758373\" width=640 height=360 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1104380/extras/2643c36e13287870ca1109797ab99492.webm?t=1646758373\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1104380/extras/2643c36e13287870ca1109797ab99492.mp4?t=1646758373\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
