    "description": "'Bacteria' - A new puzzle game from the creators of 'Energy Balance' and 'Energy Cycle'.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nThis game is based on the rules of the cellular automaton ‘Life’ devised by John Horton Conway in 1970.<br />\r\n(You can read more about how it works in greater details here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life )<br />\r\n <br />\r\nIn 'Bacteria' you have a square game field that is in some form of a stable state.  You need to add in a certain number of cells so that, after a few steps, the field will be halted (in colored mode) or even cleared (in &quot;hard&quot; black &amp; white mode).  You could draw in single points, or use standard 'Life' patterns like &quot;Gliders&quot; (they move at an angle) and &quot;Lightweight spaceships (LWSS)&quot; (they move in a straight line).<br />\r\n <br />\r\nDepending on the difficulty level, the player can use a smaller area to add new cells.",
