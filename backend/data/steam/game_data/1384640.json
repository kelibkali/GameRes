    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > Pathfinder 2 RPG - Agents of Edgewatch AP 2: Sixty Feet Under</h2>The Edgewatch agents follow up on a lead in Absalom's financial hub, where they unravel a series of clues to determine the target of an impending bank robbery and put a stop to the crime before it occurs. The robbery turns out to be just one piece to a much larger puzzle though--after the heroes investigate the bank robbers' slummy thief den, the trail ultimately leads them into the city's expansive network of underground catacombs, where the agents infiltrate and disband one of Absalom's most vicious murder cults.<br>&quot;Sixty Feet Under&quot; is a Pathfinder adventure for four 4th- or 5th-level characters.
