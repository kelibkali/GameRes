    "description": "Gatorade’s Beat the Blitz is a free-to-play VR simulation designed to put your hydration to the test. Guided by former All-Pro quarterback Peyton Manning, you’ll battle against the effects of dehydration as you dodge blitzers in our high energy throwing skills competition. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTogether with Peyton, you’ll also take a journey inside the human body where you’ll see, firsthand, how dehydration affects your performance, starting with the heart and brain. Then, you’ll have a chance to set new high scores in a challenge designed to make you sweat. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeat the Blitz is one of the first football sims to use arm motion for ball movement, giving you a realistic experience in the pocket. And you’ll see how you stack up with a true-to-life sized hologram of Peyton by your side throughout. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDo you think you can Beat the Blitz? Download and play today.",
