    "description": "<i>Mirrored Pawns</i> is a relaxing puzzle game that will challenge your spatial reasoning. Your goal is to successfully navigate 2 pawns across a chess-like board to the goal positions by working with the axes of symmetry provided to you.<br><br>When either vertical or horizontal symmetry is active, the non-player pawn will move in the opposite vertical or horizontal direction, respectively. You will need to be careful in your movements and use the puzzle board's characteristics to your advantage.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552020/extras/396902404432a8d66cded94c40ea378b.poster.avif?t=1614352747\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552020/extras/396902404432a8d66cded94c40ea378b.webm?t=1614352747\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552020/extras/396902404432a8d66cded94c40ea378b.mp4?t=1614352747\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 50 puzzle levels, each varying in difficulty and strategy<br></li><li> Secondary pawn moves equal and/or opposite to player pawn movement, depending on active axes of symmetry<br></li><li> Crystal block allows offsetting of pawn positions<br></li><li> Symmetry axis toggle for the more complex puzzles<br></li><li> Undo button allows you to undo moves<br></li><li> Relaxing soundtrack and sound effects</li></ul>",
