    "description": "Z.O.M.B.I.E. - is an unusual 3D shooter with surviving elements where you will have to survive in a zombie apocalypse, playing as a girl named Zoe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nZoe is one of some survived people who stayed alive after spreading a dangerous infection, and who has immunity to the virus. The main aim here is a sector release from enemies, collecting guns, ammos, medicines and keys that can help you to be safe and stay alive in this hell to the end of the game. There will be lots of zombies having a purpose – to kill you. Be careful and alarm! Listen to every unusual sound. Only then you will be able to win these ugly creatures. Search every new location, clear up sectors step by step. Eventually you’ll be lucky. Remember: if you don’t kill, kill you!",
