Goal of the game is to get World Record and earn the achievement.<br><br>Score Game 2D is hard (not really just poorly coded), competitive game for those chasing the &quot;rare&quot; achievements of steam, or those who want to break keyboard like i do. And yes i know it is terrible, there is no need to tell me.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>poor physics and movement<br></li><li>&quot;very hard&quot; to obtain achievement<br></li><li>overpriced content (it's a feature)<br></li><li>7 obstacles (i think)<br></li><li>at least 30sec of gameplay</li></ul><br>Roasts are always welcome. Made game for myself to help me learn the process of publishing and making games as that is something i wanted for a long time. Thank you for trying whatever this is, have fun, and hopefully i see you in my next game.<br><br>Music by Patrick de Arteaga",
