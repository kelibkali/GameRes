It also make you able to meet other community members, or just to wait for a private server to be online.<br>The self-hosted servers allow you to play any gamemode, as long as you respect the rules created by the server master.<br>Theses self-hosted servers are hosted by community members or some third-party organisation, and allow the host to configure his server as he or his community wants.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >How to create custom game content ? (Objets, Models, UIs, Gamemodes, ...)</h2><br>To create some content, you have to use the game developpement kit, called &quot;UVRSDK&quot;, and Unity 2018.3.0f2.<br>If you already used to create some avatars or worlds using VRChat, this should be really easy for you to use it.",
