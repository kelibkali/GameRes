    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A Summer Story</h2><strong><i>Snowball Saves Summer</i></strong> is a 2D physics-based platformer in which you play as Snowball, a round ball made of snow. On the night of the Summer Solstice, the evil Perchta and her minions broke into the Winter Palace. They kidnapped Snow Queen Holda, and took her all the way to Krampus Land. Without the Queen, the North Pole has already begun to melt, and soon there will be nothing left but water. Rescue the kidnapped Snow Queen and stop the North Pole from melting!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Fun With Physics</h2>Use the mouse to launch Snowball into the air.
