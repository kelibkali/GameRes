When you met Neil in your childhood–a memory he's very fond of–he mistook you for a boy. Now that you're an adult, he doesn't quite know how to deal with you. Be whisked away in his awkward charms, visiting masquerade balls and the opera. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Complete</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/939330/extras/7703d66ca620d57dfdddc80a03667d55.avif?t=1769343290\" width=616 height=121 /></span>Dimitri is the younger brother of your ex that cheated on you. When Dimitri is a college student and looking for a room to rent, you somehow end up inviting him to live at your boutique. He's sweet, easily flustered, and loves to cook for you.
