    "description": "Damascus is set in a post apocalyptic fantasy future where the destruction of the past has knocked society into a medieval state of living. Many creatures have gained sentience in this timeline leading to the rise of frogman, catsons, owlpeople and many other races. Over time humans have developed psychic abilities that they can invoke with the use of mechanical psychic actuators, these psychic abilities allow them to summon fire or teleport to new locations among many other powers. The destruction of this world was caused by Dark Gods of sacrifice known as the Gods of Destruction, the player can sacrifice items to these entities in order to receive powerful boons from them. The apocalypse was thousands of years in the past and many of those living today have very little to no knowledge of the events that transpired or the fact that there even was an apocalypse.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Design Goals</h2>Our goal is to create a MMO experience that rings true to how classic tabletop Dungeons and Dragons feels with weekly meetups where the dungeon master is creating new custom content for his players taking their decisions and desires into account. We want to have a very active community and will be working very hard to interact directly with the players of the game. We also want to implement new concepts like temporary bosses that drop limited edition items.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Controls</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Left Click to perform the most obvious action on a given tile.<br></li><li>Right click to bring out a drop-down menu of all possible actions for a given tile.<br></li><li>Tab to show or hide the sidebar.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >FAQ</h2>Here is a little set of common questions about the game in a FAQ format. We thought this would be an easy way to get across a lot of information.<br><br><br><strong>How do you guys make money?</strong><br>We sell bonds which grant membership. The bonds are redeemable for 14 days of membership and can be traded with other players if you so desire. This means its feasible to do an in game activity for someone who has already bought a bond and trade them for the bond as payment for the activity as a means to become a member.<br><br><strong>What is membership?</strong><br>Membership is the full game experience and unlocks access to all of the in game skills and grants access to the entire game world. Money made from membership helps us cover the server costs and really helps us out!<br><br><strong>Will you ever sell experience or items directly?</strong><br>No we will not. The only thing we will sell are bonds. The value of a bond in game is determined by the players and what they are willing to trade for them. The only way to gain experience or items will be to play the game. We don't believe in selling power.<br><br><strong>What are your goals in terms of membership?</strong><br>Our biggest goal would be to get 500 monthly members which would allow us to cover all our server costs and both work on the game full time. Any members over this amount would be an absolute blessing!<br><br><strong>What happens when I die in game?</strong><br>All of your currently equipped and all items in your inventory will be dropped and you will re-spawn in Split City.<br><br><strong>Will you reimburse my items if I die and lose a lot of them?</strong><br>No we will not, dying in game and losing items is part of the game and it's up to you to bank important items you don't wish to lose.<br><br><strong>How many towns are there in game?</strong><br>There are 14 towns currently in the game.<br><br><strong>What happens if I forget my password?</strong><br>As long as you provided your email address when creating your account we can reset your password for you. At a later stage we will facilitate linking your Steam account to your Damascus account which will provide extra security and password retrieval mechanisms.<br><br><strong>Why aren't you guys doing Early Access?</strong><br>The way we view MMORPG's is that they are inherently a service. Our goal is to constantly update the game as long as it is live. Due to this we didn't want to be yet another permanently in early access game and have decided to have the first stable version of the game be our release version with many updates and future content already in the pipeline.<br><br><strong>How often will you update the game?</strong><br>We plan to update the game every couple of weeks with new content, however this is a loose timeline and it could be shorter or longer depending on the content we are currently working on. We intend to be very active on Discord so you can always ask us directly about what we are working on and approximately when you can expect the next update.<br><br><strong>Will you ever expand the world map?</strong><br>Yes we do plan to at some stage release new Islands and Continents which will expand the scope and scale of the game. However these updates will take some time to implement and most likely come with new quests as some of our larger updates to the game.<br><br><strong>Will I get banned for selling in game items for cash to my friends?</strong><br>No you won't. All in game items earned by you belong to you and you a responsible for them, this means you are free to give them away or sell them to other people and it also means that it's your responsibility to not lose your items in silly ways (like attacking a Damascus Steel Dragon at a low level).<br><br><strong>Will I get banned for using/creating a third party client?</strong><br>We won't be supporting third party clients and we would consider this a bannable offense. The only version of the client one should use is the Steam version.<br><br><strong>Will I get banned for macroing or botting?</strong><br>Macros that make the game easier as well as botting are not in the spirit of the game and are considered a bannable offense. We suggest avoiding macroing entirely.",
