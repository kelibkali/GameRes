    "description": "&quot;Dead TrailZ captures a slice of the zombie apocalypse beautifully.&quot; - Eurogamer <br />\r\n&quot;I just like sniping as a game dynamic, and I liked how the game was trying to combine that with tactical placement.” - TechCrunch<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEscape the Apocalypse. Zipline between vantage points surrounding the battle field and use heavy weapons to cover your teammate on longer and longer supply runs. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBasic rules:<br />\r\n- Runner starts and ends at the train station<br />\r\n- Runner has a certain amount of ammunition which refills for each run<br />\r\n- Predict the runner's path and pave the way for him to return safely<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main game is about scavenging a series of maps, finding enough fuel &amp; weapons in each stage to progress to the next.<br />\r\nYour runner finds supplies &amp; fuel in the boxes, which he hands over to you after each run.<br />\r\nIf things get tight, call the runner back any time.<br />\r\nGather XP with your shooting kills to unlock perma-boosts and make sure to pick up some helicopter drops.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first two maps can also be played in an endless practice scenario &amp; also feature 15 strategic levels, each with a unique solution path that requires more than just shooting. Levels have a fix setup of where survivors come in and where the zombies are and can only be resolved with strategic and well-timed use of the available weapons and tools.",
