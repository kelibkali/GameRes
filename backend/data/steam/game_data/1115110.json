    "description": "Welcome to Airborne, a platformer that is has a little different of a spin on things. The puzzles of Airborne are fun and intuitive, sided by the frustrating but rewarding parkour to make an exciting combination(and also they make you mad sometimes). Luckily there are auto-saves so feel free to rage, it's fine, you're only harming your mood! Am I at fault for making this game? Probably. But mostly, Airborne is a chill environment that makes you feel accomplished when you beat a challenging level.<br>     <br>     <strong>Early Access:</strong> Airborne currently has 12 levels and 11 platforms with unique abilities. Expect a full level builder in the future<br><br>     <strong>*The price of Airborne will increase when out of Early Access*</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A List Of Platforms You Will Encounter:</h2><br>-   <h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Velocity Platform</h2>Increases speed as you walk on it, an advantage but harder to control.<br><br>-   <h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Turret</h2>shoots At You...<br><br>-   <h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Changer</h2>Teleports You to It's Corresponding Changer.<br><br>-   <h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Blocker</h2>guards new areas, can only be disabled by a button found somewhere in the level.<br><br>-   <h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Activator</h2>A strange button like platform that can deactivate Blockers.<br><br>-    <h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Leap Platform</h2>Propels the Player In the Direction Its Facing.<br><br>-    <h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >More being released soon,</h2><strong>if you have additional ideas feel free to go to the Steam discussions.</strong>",
