    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >  Marches Adventure 2: Mission to Mithril</h2>This adventure takes place on the world of Mithril, a cold, low-population frontier world. The Travellers land at Mithril's rudimentary starport, only to find their vessel disabled and the base strangely empty. As the Travellers explore, they discover there may be survivors of whatever happened at the port. A distant distress beacon is detected, but reaching it requires an overland trek. Having located the survivors, the Travellers discover their problems are only just beginning...<br><i>  Mission to Mithril</i>  is in part homage to the Classic Traveller adventure,<br><i>  Mission on Mithril</i>  , and in part a sequel. Any group of Travellers will be suitable for this adventure, though outdoors skills such as Recon and Survival will be highly useful, as well the ability to drive an ATV and fight.<br>Mission to Mithril includes:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The Sword Worlds subsector<br></li><li>Native creatures of Mithril, including the Calamander and Raucuss<br></li><li>Rough Terrain equipment and an ATV manufactured in the Sword Worlds</li></ul><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong></strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Traveller 2E (Mongoose) ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
