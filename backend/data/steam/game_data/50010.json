    "description": "<p>Nimbus is a unique combination of racing & puzzling. The player controls a craft with no means of directly propelling itself and needs to use whatever is scattered around the levels to acquire thrust and reach the goal. Traverse a world map with several distinct islands in order to recover your lost love. Light on story, but heavy on gameplay Nimbus offers several hours of increasingly harder challenges.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Key features:</h2><ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Over 50 levels available on the main campaign\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Unique game play that is easy to understand, but hard to master\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>A varied blend of levels that requires a combination of skill & puzzle solving\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Plenty of opportunity for optimizing how you approach each level in order to beat the best times\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Several trails, levels and ships to unlock\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Loads of secrets & tricks</ul>",
