    "description": "Enjoy the remarkable marriage of art and technology in Dreams of Dali, a virtual reality experience from The Dali Museum (St. Petersburg, FL), as you explore Dali's painting “Archaeological Reminiscence of Millet's ‘Angelus’.” Immerse yourself in the world of the Surrealist master like never before in this encounter, venturing into the towers, peering from them to distant lands and discovering surprises around every corner. We imagine Dali himself, known in his lifetime as what we now call an &quot;earlier adopter&quot; of new technology, would applaud this inspiring homage to his 1935 painting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis award-winning VR experience has garnered visitor acclaim, online praise and international recognition through a multitude of industry awards, including the prestigious Cannes Cyber Lion GOLD; a Webby People's Voice award; and a Facebook Silver award for Innovation, among others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n©Salvador Dali Museum, Inc., St. Petersburg, FL. Created for The Dali by Goodby Silverstein &amp; Partners, San Francisco, CA.",
