    "description": "Here is our first project, which we wanna publish on Steam! That is our biggest dream!<br />\r\nWe work for a long time and try to develop a high-quality, original game which is not available in this mode and this style.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is a top-down racing game with arcade/realistic elements<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur goals and targets<br />\r\n- Very balanced, perfect driving car physics<br />\r\n- Multiplayer mode<br />\r\n- a league mode, also designed and fitted to LAN-Partys<br />\r\n- Time Attack mode<br />\r\n- Replays<br />\r\n- Track Editor<br />\r\n- Car Editor<br />\r\n- a working community<br />\r\n- Alpha &amp; Beta Testers among the players<br />\r\n- active/active participation on development steps<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe concept / gameplay<br />\r\nThis is a new type of top-down arcade racing game, which is played and watched from the top in 3D. Various routes, cars and physics can driven in different modes like time-attack mode, lan or over the www.<br />\r\nWe have decided to use standard keyboard as input device.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach car will get tire wear, damage and fuel consumption.<br />\r\nThis means that pit-stops are needed depending on lap distance, drifts and fuel consumption.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach driven second contributes to your game progress, awards points, a leaderboard and very detailed statistics to be found on the GentRacing Site.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the core elements of GentRacing will be the league mode, for big and funny online battles. Compare your skills in different skill-levels and be the first GentRacing World Champion - under all participants of the game,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe will inform you regularly about the state of development and look forward to your comments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\ngreez<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGentRacing Team",
