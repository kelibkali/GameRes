Galaia awaits!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Developer's Note</h2><i>Galaia has been developed by <strong>just one person</strong> over 4 years! As such, it has been impossible for me to add as many content to the game as the other amazing big roguelike titles. However <strong>lots of love</strong> and care have been put in this game, so others can experience the game that I always wanted to make and play.<br><br>I'm very conscious of player's time and money, so I tried to price the game fairly for what it has to offer. Expect around a short fun game with a very replayable structure. </i><br><br>I sincerely hope you enjoy the game as much as I enjoyed making it!",
