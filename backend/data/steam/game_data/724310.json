    "description": "To commemorate Kou Shibusawa's 35th anniversary, the &quot;Kou Shibusawa Archives&quot; will be opened in the Steam Store. Here we will revive popular previously released titles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this tenth round of releases, we offer the first game developed and sold (10/26/1981) by Kou Shibusawa, &quot;Kanakawajima no Kassen.&quot; <br />\r\nIt is a Strategy simulation game. Players become Shingen Takeda and clash with Kenshin Uesugi at Kawanakajima in an attempt to wipe out his rival.  <br />\r\nPlayers can try two different game modes. The &quot;Original mode&quot; has remained faithful to the original release as much as possible, while the &quot;Remake mode&quot; has redone graphics and controls to allow for easier play.",
