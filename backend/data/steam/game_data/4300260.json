You and your crew descend into shifting underground ruins of <strong>lost civilizations</strong> to recover <strong>ancient relics</strong>, priceless artifacts, and forbidden treasures… and make it back before everything goes wrong.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Your characters are <strong>active ragdolls</strong>: you pull, drag, carry, and scramble through hazards with physics-driven movement that’s as hilarious as it is stressful. The deeper you go, the stranger the ruins become—deadly traps, unstable paths, and things that were never meant to be disturbed. The artifacts are valuable… but the quota doesn’t care about legends.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Will you escape with the relics—or become part of the ruins?</strong></p>",
