You have land but not much else and it’s up to you to spruce up the place. You’ll need to discover and provide resources for your world and your citizens will interact with it as they see fit, they have free will after all.

Your citizens can’t build out of thin air so you’ll need to give them the basics like trees and stone and hope they know what to do with it. Each object has requirements called schemas in order to be placed in the world and some need other objects present in specific spots, and it's up to you to discover how to unlock them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Plan For the Future</strong></h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1430670/extras/8ff95b273f1580afee7607605be244f0.poster.avif?t=1659830862\" width=600 height=168 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1430670/extras/8ff95b273f1580afee7607605be244f0.webm?t=1659830862\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1430670/extras/8ff95b273f1580afee7607605be244f0.mp4?t=1659830862\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Eventually, some of your citizens will feel the need to specialize and focus on a trade.
