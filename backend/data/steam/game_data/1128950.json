Search for it now!</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Introduction:</h2><br><br><strong>Fringe Planet</strong> is a survival simulator game inspired by Rimworld, Dwarf Fortress, Factorio, Eldritch and more. All set within a well developed universe inspired by the works of fantastic fiction - H.P. Lovecraft, Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Shelley and Lewis Carroll<br><br>Six strangers awake in a frozen land with no memory of who they are. Can you help save these strangers? Tame <strong>occult</strong> forces, <strong>survive</strong> the cold, harness the power of <strong>magically</strong> powered <strong>technology</strong> and ultimately defeat an <strong>Elder God</strong>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Game Features:</h2> <br><br><i>Detailed simulations</i><br><br>The peons have bones, organs and memories. A fire will heat up a room, leaving a door open will let the warmth escape. Plants grow and can be farmed. Ore is placed in unique patterns, magical spirits walk along ley lines and can be captured. Magic is real and has consequences.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1128950/extras/f54a713737d3bbd2ba7e1f721fb7faaf.poster.avif?t=1666693401\" width=600 height=364 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1128950/extras/f54a713737d3bbd2ba7e1f721fb7faaf.webm?t=1666693401\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1128950/extras/f54a713737d3bbd2ba7e1f721fb7faaf.mp4?t=1666693401\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><i>Deep and extensive lore</i><br><br>The lore of Fringe Planet is incredibly detailed, with a lot of stories to be uncovered, and a lot of mysteries to be solved. Heavily inspired by Lovecraft and others, this lore is as fantastic as it is terrifying. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1128950/extras/bd80cf8173595b2d9b7e88a4b0f5b4f1.avif?t=1666693401\" width=600 height=346 /></span><br><br><i>Epic machinery</i><br><br>Automation can be the key to success in Fringe Planet. Setting up belts to perform crafting or mining will free up a peon from doing a task manually. Mining machines will extract ore from voxels much more efficiently than a peon would - it's up to you to decide how best to use this technology.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1128950/extras/e9bf587e7904494892f6055be18e0909.poster.avif?t=1666693401\" width=600 height=328 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1128950/extras/e9bf587e7904494892f6055be18e0909.webm?t=1666693401\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1128950/extras/e9bf587e7904494892f6055be18e0909.mp4?t=1666693401\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><i>Replayability</i><br><br>Every game will be different. The game is designed so that every play through happens differently; with a gazillion possible peon combinations and an even higher number of possible starting islands - every game will feel very different.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1128950/extras/e9238c2bbdd790b7943aa737f90d5061.avif?t=1666693401\" width=600 height=394 /></span><br><br><i>Brutally hard story telling</i><br><br>Fringe Planet is not an easy game. The storytellers are actively trying to force you into a &quot;game over&quot; state. The frozen reality of an island floating through an infinite void is a brutal one for survival. Expect to be replaying this game a lot.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1128950/extras/dc810057bc0ce13d85d8d720b182c702.avif?t=1666693401\" width=600 height=404 /></span><br><br><i>A living breathing world</i><br><br>As eldritch as the universe of Fringe Planet is, it's a living world. Creatures hunt, nest and breed. Wind blows and trees grow. All of this is designed to create a dynamic and interesting world to play with. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1128950/extras/43d72cdf302799b806b73400ff2dd764.poster.avif?t=1666693401\" width=592 height=444 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1128950/extras/43d72cdf302799b806b73400ff2dd764.webm?t=1666693401\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1128950/extras/43d72cdf302799b806b73400ff2dd764.mp4?t=1666693401\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><i>Modding support</i><br><br>The game has been built with extensive modding support. Steam workshop integration will be implemented on release, and the modding documentation will be extensive. Every aspect of the game can be changed/tweaked.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1128950/extras/222ae0601b3a3a51e9bfb1519c9e1ee0.avif?t=1666693401\" width=600 height=820 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About development</h2><br><br>Fringe Planet has been in development for a year and a half now, and is being developed by a solo developer from the United Kingdom. Fueled mostly by tea, he is working full time on Fringe Planet - and often wishes there were more hours in the day. The game is under constant changes, therefore both graphics and minimum requirements may change over time. There are both extensive blog posts and daily tweets about development on the Fringe Planet website.",
