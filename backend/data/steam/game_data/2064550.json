However tonight you have a lot of uninvited guests who just won't leave you alone! Getting rid of a load of ghost-hunting teenagers might be tough, but with your sneaking skills (and perhaps a little help) you just might be able to manage it… after you overcome your fear of the dark!<br><br>Scared Little Ghost is a stealth-based adventure game. You are a little ghost who is frightened of the dark and just wants to get back to sleep. Creep around the graveyard, figure out your ghostly powers, and use them to restore tranquillity so that you can get back to your eternal rest.",
