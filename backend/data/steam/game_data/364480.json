Meet interesting characters in a psychological adventure, solve puzzles and learn all about the story of Artuo, the knight who wants to be a wizard; Red, a fire goblin that was summoned by Artuo; Melchior, the wizard of dreams and his companions. <br><br>Red Goblin takes inspiration from a host of old school retro platformers.
