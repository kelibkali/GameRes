    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >City Backdrop: Languard</h2>Storied Languard--capital of Ashlar and its greatest city--stands hard against Hard Bay's turbulent, stormy waters. To the north lies the Mottled Spire's brooding spray-drenched mass, the curse-haunted ruins of Greystone and Gloamhold's doom-wreathed halls. Ashlar's greatest--indeed only--city, Languard is a noisy, dirty place. Here, amid broad, muddy streets teeming with life and shadow-mantled, danger-filled alleyways there is little beneath the sun that cannot be had somewhere--for a price.<br>Few Languardians overly concern themselves with the brooding terrors lurking within Gloamhold's halls, but for others, the legendary, benighted ruin draws them to Languard as a moth to a flame. For within Languard's stout walls live, plot and scheme a surprising number of adventurers, freebooters and mercenaries all lured here by the treasures said to lie but a scant few miles to the north.<br><i>Low City Locations:</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>G1 Low Gate: Low Gate is always busy, choked with a multitude of carts piled high with trade goods.<br></li><li>G3 Traitor's Gate: &quot;Decorated&quot; with the remains of traitors to the crown, Traitor's Gate is well named.<br></li><li>L1 Low Market: A bustling market fills this muddy space.<br></li><li>L2 Vonya's Span: Of dwarven craft--and reputedly haunted--Vonya's Span is the only bridge spanning the Svart.<br></li><li>L3 The Scythe: The one-legged Arvo Outila runs this drinking den renown for live music.<br></li><li>T1 Fane of the Waves Eternal: Here Serat's worshippers commune with the ocean's eternal glory.</li></ul><i>High City Locations:</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>G2 River Gate: These two towers oversee all river traffic.<br></li><li>G4 Duke's Gate: The least-used of Languard's gates.
