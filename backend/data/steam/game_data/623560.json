    "description": "The world of Tarth was a bright and shining jewel. The Great Race Wars were long over, the people were free, and true evil had been scattered to the dark bowels of the earth. The King of Valusia sat upon his throne and ruled his peaceful valley and its honest citizens with a firm yet fair grip. <strong><br>The future of Tarth was bright.<br>Until they came. And the light went out forever.<br>Evernight is a very different kind of dark fantasy setting. This fantasy grounds conversion of the 144-page hardback book provides a complete scripted campaign, from before the arrival of the mysterious and terrifying Masters to the epic and bloody finish. Player characters start as Novices in a familiar fantasy world of elves, dwarves, orcs, and men. They finish as Heroic adventurers in a land draped in eternal night and overwhelming horror. Evernight contains new Edges &amp; Hindrances, spells, weapons, and magical items. The Game Master has a complete scene by scene campaign ready to run, the truth behind Tarth's murky past, and a host of new and mysterious monsters!<br><i>Evernight requires the Savage Worlds ruleset.[/b]</i><br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Perry Chalmers</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.</strong>",
