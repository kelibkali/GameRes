It is a deeply personal journey into the mind of a young woman as she tries to stay afloat in Copenhagen during a summer riddled with hopelessness. Amid the desire for isolation there’s still a hope that one day, things will change. Maybe the shadow monster in her apartment can help her?<br><br>Stilstand is a personal and hand-drawn tale about the high expectations and the fragile limbo of feeling stuck in life. It is a whimsical and absurd portrayal of anxiety, loneliness, and despair, and brings the player with it on an adventure into the emotional landscape of a lost soul.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Flip through the pages of an interactive graphic novel and watch it come to life as you play.<br></li><li>Search for love and adventures, send text messages, and scroll through strange social media feeds.<br></li><li>Play unique mini-games.<br></li><li>Enjoy detailed and expressive black and white illustrations and a genre-bending cinematic soundtrack.</li></ul><br><strong>Stilstand has an average playtime of 1 hour.</strong>",
