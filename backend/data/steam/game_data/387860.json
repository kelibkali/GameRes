    "description": "A dark/sad/weird/funny first person exploration game. You play a man on his last night alive as he obsesses over a mysterious painting. More of a story game in that it emphasizes mood and character over gameplay. Takes ten minutes to play and has &quot;next-gen&quot; features like a shrimp tank with pet shrimp. <strong>Be warned, the game contains explicit handling of suicide.</strong><br><br>For people that have played the game elsewhere, this is the original version, not an expansion or HD remake. <br><br>Follow me on twitter at @jessebarksdale. I post updates about new things there.",
