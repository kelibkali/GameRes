Nudge an asteroid with your ship and it might come crashing down on you as you walk around on a planet minutes later. Day and night cycles are caused by the planets rotations and we even simulate temperature and air resistance. You are free to do anything within the confines of the simulation.

Parents can play with their young children. Or gamers can play with their less talented parents and siblings. Rookie mode makes the controls easier and stops the player from doing obviously dangerous things.",
