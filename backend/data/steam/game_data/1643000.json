    "description": "We find ourselves in the presence of a small, traditional point &amp; click adventure game demo, the first development by Alcachofa Soft. Created in 1994 (and a product of its time), it was proposed to Dinamic Multimedia for development. Eventually, some time later, it served for Alcachofa Soft to bring Dráscula: The Vampire Strikes Back to life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the game, in a distant galaxy, the inhabitants of a planet where life originated from sausage molecules embark on their Sausage-Wing ships to invade other planets and make sausages out of their inhabitants. After arriving on Earth and getting the inhabitants of Los Angeles on board one of their ships, Paco, a vegetarian Hare Krishna armed only with his evangelizing book, is going to board the ship to rescue his fellow citizens.",
