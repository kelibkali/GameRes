    "description": "The main forces of ISIS have been beaten, but the war is far from being over. Al-Qaeda is entrenched in Idlib, the remaining &quot;blacks&quot; are still roaming the country, and variously &quot;moderate&quot; jihadists are still waiting for their chance to strike a wicked blow from one of their numerous enclaves. Examples of bravery are plenty, both in the past and in the present, and many of the battles in this war we'd like to represent in our game. We're giving our players the tools to immortalize any of the battles in this war on their own!<br><br>The Syrian Battlefields DLC includes:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>the level editor;<br></li><li>level scripting and editor manuals;<br></li><li>free access to all game resources, including data on units, weapons and other objects in a format easily accessible with Excel or other similar editors;<br></li><li>Steam Workshop integration for publishing and playing user-made levels and campaigns;<br></li><li>several new missions by the developers, focused on the Kuweires blockade in 2015 and the events in Eastern Ghouta in 2018. In these missions the players will get to see familiar faces and learn how Tiger-4's career began and how the war ended for Anwar Amin.</li></ul>",
