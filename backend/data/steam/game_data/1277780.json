    "description": "This is a <strong>DEMO</strong> of the game <strong>Aeon of Sands – The Trail</strong> <i>(savegames are compatible with the full game!)</i>.<br><br>If you like it, please buy the game:<br><br><br><strong>Aeon of Sands – The Trail</strong> is a roleplaying game set in a post-apocalyptic desert world. It combines real-time exploration gameplay with classic gamebooks where you create your very own non-linear story adventure.<br><br>You play the vain and clumsy Setrani, a simple clerk aspiring to a simple life. But in the post-apocalyptic world of Aeon of Sands, nothing is ever that easy... A single missing caravan will set plans in motion, and seal the fate of our unlikely hero.<br><br><strong><i>What if your favorite “Choose your own Adventure” book was, instead of crumpled pages to turn and dice to throw, an epic FPP dungeon crawler?</i></strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >FEATURES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The world of Aeon of Sands may be lethal, but it is not humorless. Think “Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy” meets Interplay's Fallout!<br></li><li> Emphasis on exploration: the deadly world of AoS is filled with secrets, switchs, loot and eccentric characters to meet... or to fight!<br></li><li> <strong>Non-linearity:</strong> Follow the story at your own speed, or at your own will.<br></li><li> <strong>Replayability:</strong> Do it differently all over, face multiple endings!<br></li><li> Completely hand drawn 2.5D environment, 240 hand-drawn illustrations<br></li><li> Auto-mapping, with a writing feature<br></li><li> <strong>Real-time combat</strong>, with grid-based tactics<br></li><li> Organic character's customization: forget xp and levels, stats are likened to the gear you choose and the skills you use.</li></ul>",
