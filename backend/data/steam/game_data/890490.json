Experience an entirely new campaign that situates itself right into the pre-existing story. Play around with a modified version of the Gossip System for the Election Rounds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWho will you help become class president?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo play this DLC:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- You must reach the REBOOT ending of the base game.<br />\r\n- Choose REBOOT MODE at the start of a new game<br />\r\n- Choose ALT-U.",
