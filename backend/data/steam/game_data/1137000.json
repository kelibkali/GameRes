    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > D&amp;D Classics: FRC1 Ruins of Adventure (1E)</h2>A great evil force descended on the town of Phlan years ago. The townspeople were all either killed or driven away, and Phlan became (literally) a ghost town. Fifty years later, the survivors are ready to reclaim their town. But they need a band of strong and brave adventurers to lead the fight-they need you.<br>Ruins of Adventure is a set of connected short adventures written by James Ward, David &quot;Zeb&quot; Cook, Steve Winter and Mike Breault-four names familiar to all Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons game fans. It uses the same setting, locations and characters as the classic computer game Pool of Radiance by Strategic Simulations, Inc. In fact, many of the scenarios here in Ruins of Adventure will provide important clues to the successful completion of Pool of Radiance.<br><strong><br><i> We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today.
