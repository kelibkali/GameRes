    "description": "This is the teaser demo for Emily Wants to Play Too. You play as a young guy that works for a sandwich restaurant. Everyone has just left your apartment after a wild party. It is early in the morning. You haven't slept yet tonight, and you are exhausted. You've got work tomorrow... BLUH! Get some rest, get ready and head to work. Sounds easy? It is! Nothing scary about getting ready for work. ;)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince I missed a summer release, I decided to release the intro of Emily Wants to Play Too. Thank you to everyone that supported the first game, I hope you enjoy this demo. The full game release of Emily Wants to Play Too should not be far behind.",
