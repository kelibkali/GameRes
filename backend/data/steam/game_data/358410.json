    "description": "<strong>This is the classic, 1995 version of <i>Rise of the Triad.</i> For the 2023 remaster, please see the <i>Ludicrous Edition</i> store page.</strong><br><br>Tackle incredible game hazards, such as spinblades, gun bunkers, huge boulders, Firejets, pits, Firechutes, Lavawalls, gas grates, and more. <br><br>&quot;Like DOOM, Rise of the Triad is a high quality, fast scrolling first-person perspective 3D action game. Graphics are on par with DOOM. It has destructive enemies and lots of them, an arsenal of weapons from simple pistols to missile launchers, life-preserving armor, traps and ambushes galore, and the ability to play by modem or network. In all, there's a great degree of similarity between the two games. In addition, Rise of the Triad puts most of the other DOOM wannabes to shame - it's that good!&quot; -  Chuck Miller, Editor of interactive Entertainment<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><br><strong>Rise of the Real Estate</strong>: Super huge levels - up to one million sq. feet, and up to 16 stories high!<br><br><strong>Digital Diversity</strong>: Ten unique, digitized enemies in the game, plus four multi-stage bosses!<br><br><strong>Win Your Way</strong>: Thirteen hardcore weapons and play as one of five characters, each with unique attributes and abilities.<br><br><strong>Collateral Damage</strong>: Nearly every object can be destroyed - even mark walls with bullet holes!<br><br><strong>Connect and Kill</strong>: Modem and network playable, up to 11 players via an IPX compatible network.<br><br><strong>Controller Support</strong>: Partial Xbox 360 Controller support.",
