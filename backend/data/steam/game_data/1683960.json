    "description": "Meet the Virtues, they are magical beings who live in a secret city above the clouds and whose purpose is to help us, virtuans, learn to express our virtues. They may use their special Instruments (like a whistle) to make us feel brave or friendly in a blink of an eye, but they can only complete their missions if they make us learn how to express virtues by ourselves.<br><br>Courage is a Virtue with confidence issues who hasn't completed a single mission in her life, but when she has a fateful encounter with you, a spark of hope begins to light in her heart. With your help, she's supposed to make a little boy named Sam face a haunted mansion to make his adventurous friend Andrea happy, but is that the only courage issue on this mission? Or is there something more?<br><br><strong>[About this game]</strong><br>Glisten to your heart is an emotional story-driven game focused on you! You may be an invisible entity from a world beyond the game, but you’re also one of the main characters in the story and your decisions might get you new conversations, essences and even major story changes. The whole point of the game is to make you feel various emotions, as you get inside this world, play minigames, explore and interact with amazing characters and help them with your words, warmth and jokes.<br><br><strong>[Main characters]</strong><br>All characters are imperfectly-perfect and I hope you get to like each one of them.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1683960/extras/b252ca3bd3a767543d0385cb7133ee8e.apng?t=1635421111\"><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1683960/extras/b252ca3bd3a767543d0385cb7133ee8e.poster.avif?t=1635421111\" class=\"bb_img\" width=600 height=200 /></picture></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A heartwarming tale of courage and hope with over 4-7 hours of gameplay</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Make small decisions to get new conversations, items, jokes or learn more about the characters</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Make huge decisions that affect the story (even the characters will remember your past decisions)</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Get to know the characters with optional Free talks</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Solve courage issues, like the fear of being yourself or telling your friend you’re too scared to do something</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fill up your encyclopedia with Virtues’ vocabulary and rules, life lessons, jokes and fun facts about the characters</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Play minigames like Face your fears, Choose correct thoughts and more</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Break the 4th wall!
