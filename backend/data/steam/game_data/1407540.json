Just pick some levers, reels, and do some pulling and spinning. It sure will do the work, but the question is - how motivated are you to beat your own records? <br><br>Acceleration is the key, but well... Without some wings, propellers, and a proper body, the challenge might get harder than you'd like it to be. Luckily, we have a garage filled with all the necessary plane parts (and friendly robots, ready to help whenever you would need them)! Decide which ones do you want to use and assemble them as you like! <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1407540/extras/d867e3823c19b95ec72faee2a5a718c1.avif?t=1635240853\" width=600 height=120 /></span><br><br>Decorate it with colored sprays and additional parts if you want to see your artistic part taking over.
