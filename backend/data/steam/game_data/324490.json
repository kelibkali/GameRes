It has no ending as it is also an example of the non-linear nature of the full game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Synopsis</h2>Caffeine is a quirky first person psychological horror adventure game with environmental puzzles. <br><br>Set in the near future, the entire population of Earth is vigorously addicted to coffee. Massive space stations built by the biggest corporations roam the stars mining minerals to create a synthetic caffeine. <br><br>You awaken aboard one of these caffeine mining stations alone. Before long you realise that you are a young boy with no memory of what has transpired on this seemingly empty space station. <br><br>Naturally you set out to explore the depths of the huge structure to figure out what exactly is going on.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Full Game Will Include</h2>Horror – You are alone in a mysteriously empty space station. Who knows what’s out there! <br>Lore – Sticky notes, audio logs, whiteboards etc. This place feels lived in with each character having a rich back-story that can be deciphered from just walking into an office or quarters. <br>Puzzles – Interesting environmental and memory based puzzles. <br>Oculus Rift support <br>4K resolution support <br>Controller support",
