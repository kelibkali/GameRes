Gods help the city if they succeed!</i><br>Welcome to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Lair Assault program! You hold in your hands a module that contains an ultra-challenging encounter designed to be played in a single game session. Odds are the player characters will be annihilated, but that's part of the fun!<br>In this adventure, the heroes assault a temple complex dedicated to the fire primordial Maegera and come face to face with their own mortality. Only the most clever and canny adventuring party has any hope of survival.<br>As the DM, not only is it your job to challenge the player characters, but also to kill them outright-all in good fun, of course. (Make sure your players know that!) Don't play favorites or fudge die rolls, however. The encounter is difficult enough that you can let the dice fall where they may.<br>Here are just a few of the features you'll find in the <i>D&amp;D Lair Assault - Forge of the Dawn Titan (5E)</i> module:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>One large battlemap with a unique surprise halfway through the module.<br></li><li>Pre-placed encounters for party sizes of 4, 5 and 6.<br></li><li>Linked room descriptions<br></li><li>Stats for all necessary NPCs converted for D&amp;D fith edition</li></ul><strong>Requirements: </strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software with the built-in 5E Ruleset.<br><strong>Recommended: </strong> D&amp;D Basic Rules, D&amp;D Player's Handbook or D&amp;D Character Customization Pack<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Zeph Ponos</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included D&amp;D fifth edition ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
