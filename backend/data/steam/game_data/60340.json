Unlock all 20 achievements as you collect Ankh coins for extra lives and catch falling treasures for big bonus points. <br><br>\t\t\t\t\t\tSave ancient Egypt in the 100-level Adventure mode, or test your accuracy in all-new Blast mode—the 2-minute timed mode that challenges you to rack up the points.  Or play through People’s Choice mode, where we give you 15 of players’ favorites levels from LUXOR 2, LUXOR 3 and Quest for the Afterlife!  <br><br>\t\t\t\t\t\tMaster four new power-ups: the powerful Double Shooter, the devastating Black Hole, the ruinous Spiker Ball, and the deathly Lead Barrage.  Outfitted with 25 all-new backgrounds and pathways, LUXOR Fifth Passage also introduces the Eye of Horus—click the button when you’re in a real jam to eliminate all remaining spheres.  And, for the true LUXOR Pharaoh, an Insane difficulty level to test your marble-shooting skills!
