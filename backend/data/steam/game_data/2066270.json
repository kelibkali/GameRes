This island is home to creatures unlike anything you have ever seen before and trees that put all man-made buildings to shame. Although the environment is beautiful, be weary! Whether is it a wall of prickling thorns or pools of water that can cause Ezra's augmentations to short circuit, there are many dangers hidden beneath the tree's thick canopy. <br><br>Working with the local fauna to destroy obstacles in Ezra's path, you can clear obstacles littered throughout the island to progress ever closer to your crashed ship deep within the heart of the jungle. Along the way, using Ezra's high-tension leg and mechanical wing augments, you can easily jump around the environment and find three ship parts that fell off of the ship during crash landing. Have fun exploring and enjoying the fantastical island with your new friendly creatures, but be warned...there is something lurking deeper in the jungle.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2066270/extras/a40fc13b180859695c853dd6bb194d1f.avif?t=1670245275\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Interact with the local fauna<br></li><li>Solve puzzles to progress<br></li><li>Find the detached ship parts scattered throughout the island</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2066270/extras/a0314dc9cb71f37107ea1d9189626940.avif?t=1670245275\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><br>This game was developed as a student project at DigiPen Institute of Technology and was created for educational purposes only.
