Gone are the days of laborious quest chains as you enter into a freer world of milestones and opportunities where you choose who to help, what to do, and what you aim to achieve.<br><br>Backed by classic turn-based combat and stealth systems, and steeped in a universe from the mind of Ed Greenwood, creator of the Forgotten Realms – you are invited to shape the fate of the world.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1064120/extras/abdca382071fd4d6cc3dc4e7cc3b2917.poster.avif?t=1711554027\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1064120/extras/abdca382071fd4d6cc3dc4e7cc3b2917.webm?t=1711554027\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1064120/extras/abdca382071fd4d6cc3dc4e7cc3b2917.mp4?t=1711554027\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><strong>Actions Have Consequences</strong><br>Kalsundia is alive. Its inhabitants act, and react, with purpose. They own properties, have unique personalities, befriend some, and make enemies of others. They have likes and dislikes, and can form an appreciation of – or disdain for – factions, individuals, and you. How you interact with them builds your bespoke world and tells your unique story.<br><br><strong>Choices Shape Destiny</strong><br>The consequences of your actions are both far-reaching and powerful. With each opportunity, you may sow the seeds of chaos, unite people against tyranny, become a conqueror and more. As choices are made, your influence spreads across the world and dynamically changes not only how you are perceived, but how people and factions perceive and interact with each other. Everything eventually culminates into one final fate for Kalsundia.<br><br><strong>Comprehensive Customization</strong><br>Unleash your creativity with deep character creation systems inspired by tabletop RPGs. Customize your appearance, abilities, and backstory.<br><br><strong>Gather Your Party</strong><br>Set out and recruit others in Kalsundia who align with your goals. Unlike most RPGs, there is no limitation to who you can recruit, but keep in mind that everyone has their own desires and might not be willing to do things that are against their nature.<br><br><strong>Find Your Path</strong><br>Roll for initiative and carefully plan your moves in a CRPG turn-based combat system where the execution of precise tactics emboldens you to emerge victorious from each battle. Or, embrace the art of subterfuge with stealth systems, mastering the shadows to manipulate your surroundings and achieve your objectives undetected.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1064120/extras/c663962dec5a281b0910f20d6fd11ce2.poster.avif?t=1711554027\" width=600 height=250 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1064120/extras/c663962dec5a281b0910f20d6fd11ce2.webm?t=1711554027\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1064120/extras/c663962dec5a281b0910f20d6fd11ce2.mp4?t=1711554027\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Backstory</h2>The Great War between the Avondus and Nethick Empires brought death, destruction and subjugation to Horiza. The displaced and dispossessed sought sanctuary in the uncharted lands of Kalsundia.<br><br>When the once-mighty empires sought to conquer this new frontier, they were met by indomitable defiance from a united front. Not only had the fledgling factions of Kalsundia put aside their differences to repel imperial conquest and oppression, they had also discovered a means to break the compulsion bonds put in place by their former oppressors.<br><br>As a new era of freedom emerges for the lands of Kalsundia, you hold the reins of fate in your hands. Will you form alliances, sow conflict, or pioneer unseen destinies? The future of this ever-evolving world awaits your decisive action.",
