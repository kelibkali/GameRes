    "description": "The planet, shrouded in a never-ending slumber, now finds itself in the pathway of a wandering, interplanetary creature whose presence brings an impenetrable stillness to the world. The inhabitants of the planet have a last chance to find salvation before the inevitable collision will occur…<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEXAELLA is a 3D side-scrolling shooter game where you must guide the chief operator through the dark corridors of the Xonasu, the artificial sleep centre. On the way, you must solve multiple tasks given by A.I.(Artificial Intelligence of a complex), gather resources, and defend itself and the helplessly sleeping patients of a Xonasu complex.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe plot of the game is the alternative version of the events from the animation film EXAELLA.",
