    "description": "<strong>Wargame: Red Dragon is back with a free and brand new 10v10 map: Russian Roulette</strong><br><br>The Russian Roulette map features an innovative circular level design that has armies intertwined at the start, rather than facing each other. With six twin deployment zones available at the edges of the map, Russian Roulette alternates and provides each side with three, allowing them to directly flank one another right from the beginning.<br><br>Secure the flanks while moving towards the center to take hold of the command zones, or choose to regroup, thus leaving easy points &amp; reinforcement zones to the enemy.<br><br>Setting a few records for the Wargame: Red Dragon franchise, Russian Roulette features the largest playable area ever designed for the game, allowing large-scale maneuvers. It’s also the map with the highest density of fields and gameplay elements ever made, leaving ample room for ambushes and sneak tactics.<br><br>Do you dare play Russian Roulette?",
