It is easily adapted to any fantasy desert campaign.<br><i>  Just outside Per-Bastet, in the kingdom of Nuria Natal, lie the newly discovered remains of Anu-Asir, a city once believed to exist only in myth. The ruins of Anu-Asir lie submerged under accumulations of sand, floodwater, and tall tales. It is now a hub of activity for those seeking to uncover its secrets--and profit from them. Droves of the curious, hopeful, greedy, and eccentric congregate around the unearthed city.</i><br><i>  And just outside Anu-Asir, across the River Nuria, lies the most recently surfaced relic: the Pyramid of Tiberesh. Dare you explore its deadly mysteries?</i><br>This adventure premiered at Gen Con 2015 in Indianapolis, to much acclaim, and is presented here in an expanded version.<br><i>  Line of sight by: </i>  <strong>  Robert Duncan</strong><br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Wolfgang Baur</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included 5E Compatible ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
