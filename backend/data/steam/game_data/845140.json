    "description": "The P-47D (or the 'Jug' as it was affectionately known) was one of the heaviest fighters of World War II. This weight required a very powerful engine so the aircraft was fitted with the same engine that powered the Hellcat and the Vought Corsair - the Pratt and Whitney R2800. An impressive load-out capability coupled with very capable .50 calibre machine guns ensured that the Thunderbolt was a very capable medium-range escort fighter and an accomplished ground attack aircraft. It did, however, have an issue with visibility to the rear and the canopy was modified to resemble that of the Hawker Typhoon with an all-encompassing ‘bubble top’ which allowing better all-round vision. The new canopy resulted in the new designation P-47D-25 which was nicknamed 'The Superbolt' by pilots in the field.<br><br>This highly detailed Aeroplane Heaven P-47D add-on is modelled after the initial P-47D-25 bubble top specification.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>15 high quality authentic liveries.<br></li><li>Multiple innovative animations and an optional realistic animated pilot figure<br></li><li>Extensively equipped and highly detailed virtual cockpit<br></li><li>Colourful nose art<br></li><li>Modern high-resolution textures<br></li><li>Separate cockpit gauge lighting<br></li><li>Channel pre-selector controls (NAV 1 only)<br></li><li>Gun firing effects with visible gun casings and smoke<br></li><li>Load-out control for wing stores, 'cold &amp; dark' start-up and show/hide pilot<br></li><li>Choice of centre panel options: not used, gunsight or radios<br></li><li>Selectable wing options: pylons only, wing fuel tanks of 75/108/150 gallons and 500lb/1,000lb bombs<br></li><li>Authentic engine sound set including cockpit sounds such as switches, clickable knobs, pumps etc.<br></li><li>PDF colour manual that includes extensive information on cockpit usage and the engine starting operation</li></ul>",
