    "description": "<i><strong>From Harmonix, the creators of <i>Rock Band</i> and <i>Amplitude</i>, comes a fresh new approach to the traditional shoot 'em up! All the action in <i>A City Sleeps</i> is driven by an entrancing experimental hip hop / electronic soundtrack, with no beatmatch required. The game's Idol System also introduces a tactical layer on top of proven shmup gameplay to accommodate a range of play styles.</strong></i><br><br><i>A City Sleeps</i> follows Poe, the youngest member of The Silk, an ancient clan of dream exorcists that can enter the minds of sleeping hosts to rid their dreams of demons. When the residents of SanLo fall into an endless slumber, only Poe can rescue them from a never-ending nightmare. Equipped with her legendary Koto-sword “Heartstrings”, and flanked by her stable of powerful ghost familiars,  she must cleanse their dreams, and uncover the city’s dark secrets. <br> <br>Driven by an unforgettable original soundtrack that builds through player actions and enemy engagement, A City Sleeps infuses classic twin-stick hardcore shoot ‘em up sensibilities with moment-to-moment tactical choices.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A STYLISH, MUSIC-DRIVEN SHOOT ‘EM UP FROM HARMONIX</h2> <br><strong>MUSIC / GAMEPLAY SYNCHRONY -</strong> Level design and song authoring is done in parallel, ensuring a hand crafted and utterly unique audio-experience. Music drives player projectiles, enemy spawning, movement, and bullet patterns.<br> <br><strong>THE “IDOL” SYSTEM – </strong>Get tactical! Use Poe’s ghost familiars to possess inanimate objects of the dream world; these “Idols” will assist you against an endless enemy horde.  The soundtrack builds as you leverage a range of  both offensive and defensive abilities including AOE damage bursts, and healing bullets. Experiment with different ghost combinations to compliment your own personal play style.<br> <br><strong>GIVE UP THE GHOST!!</strong> – Reverie, Lucid, Nightmare; multiple difficulties for all skill levels.  Need backup?  Buff Poe with equip-able relics and unlockable ghosts types for a tactical advantage, or take a stab at the re-mixed “Cursed” variants for an even greater challenge! Compete against friends and the world in the global leaderboads!<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/316180/extras/fecbfe9721b2a25914aaf7d137ba478a.avif?t=1447362884\" width=616 height=1101 /></span>",
