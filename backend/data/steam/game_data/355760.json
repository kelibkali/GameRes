    "description": "In Drizzlepath you are set on a journey to the top of the Mountain of Fire. This game is what you'd call a &quot;walking simulator&quot;. It aims to be an atmospheric, relaxed and enigmatic experience. It was made in CryEngine 3 to achieve an immersive graphic quality. If you enjoy games that are about the experience of discovering of the world around you, you will probably love Drizzlepath.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you download the game, you also have the game's OST in your &quot;...Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Drizzlepath\\Drizzlepath OST&quot; folder.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote: Drizzlepath is a short game and has no save feature. The checkpoint system in game is for situations like getting stuck in a hole or dying by falling down from high grounds. It only works in game session and resets when you quit game to main menu or desktop.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPS: The core aspect of this game is the atmosphere. It is recommended for those who mostly seek to experience the mood.",
