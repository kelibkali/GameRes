Feast your brains...<br><br><strong><u>The Hoplite Dynasty</u></strong><br>You start off in command of the Hoplite Dynasty; a savage empire of ticked off &quot;rabbots&quot; who burrow into the enemy fleets with a fevered tenacity found only in the cold vacuum of space. They're an angry mob of cranksters; always more than ready to tear it up on behalf of your maniacal calculations.

They're a fierce army of mechanized Bees who live only to put the sting in your zing. The little ones die off easy, but they're cheap to replenish and 'death by a thousand cuts' is no joke. In fact, it's exactly the good times these swarmy little bast*rds crave as they smash against the windshield of endless war:<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/562230/extras/33683735fd5bda6efbff580b0153a16f.poster.avif?t=1728418218\" width=512 height=288 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/562230/extras/33683735fd5bda6efbff580b0153a16f.webm?t=1728418218\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/562230/extras/33683735fd5bda6efbff580b0153a16f.mp4?t=1728418218\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong><u>The Techno Slug Party</u></strong><br>Once you've pushed the Bzzerks through to victory and cranked the galaxy down another notch, you'll have sufficiently brought the Techno Slug Party under your iron rule. These slimy little dance party invertebrates don't know the meaning of sleep, or healthy choices... or paying rent - but they'll put some serious hurt on anything that stands in their way. As malleable and spaced out as they may seem, their chemical fortitude is yours to wield with lucid vicariousness. I don't want to give away too much, but unlike their more sober predecessors, they will literally go the extra mile for a true Tyrant.<br><br>We'd show you the Techno Slugs too, but it would be in violation of our low attention span directive.

Blue Wizard recently released the darkly comic sliding block puzzle/ 80's slasher movie tribute Slayaway Camp to Steam and iOS. The Space Tyrant team consists of a crew of gore-thirsting void pirates and psychic mutants barely contained inside a fetid barracks atop a Capitol Hill coffeeshop in Seattle.
