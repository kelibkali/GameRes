Earthlings are smaller and weaker than the violent men of Secren.  Demetri's only hope for survival is to bond with a strong mate who can love and protect him.  The heterosexual Italian-American refuses to do that.  He's not a homophobe, but he won't have gay sex to survive--or will he?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1500040/extras/68bd35def2340ebad0a41478826c7b99.avif?t=1646396433\" width=600 height=338 /></span><br><br>Based on the Bestselling novel series by author Yamila Abraham, and illustrated by the internationally renowned art studio Dany&amp;Dany!

Multiple endings can be achieved in every route!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1500040/extras/b53f95fe6f3324ad7491fbd2833c3b21.avif?t=1646396433\" width=600 height=338 /></span><br><br>Maelstrom is rated 'Mature Players' only.  There is no explicit sex or nudity illustrated in the game, however, it is heavily implied, vividly described, and alluded to.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1500040/extras/6d2cf6fede2d3382985b67c60b1b1d14.avif?t=1646396433\" width=600 height=338 /></span><br><br><strong><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> A 150,000 Word Game with Numerous Endings<br></li><li> Now with FOUR Love Interests Planned! <br></li><li> Many Steam Achievements! <br></li><li> Up to 30 Gorgeous CGs!<br></li><li> 17 Different Music Tracks<br></li><li> Your Favorite Characters from the Novels Plus Amazing New Ones!<br></li><li> Mostly Linear Storytelling, with Pivotal Choices Added <br></li><li> Happily Ever After Endings for Every Route!<br></li><li> High Stakes Drama Add Authenticity to Demetri's Inevitable Seduction!<br></li><li> A Sci-Fi Game with a Wild West Motif</li></ul></strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1500040/extras/1511daf2d418b5c9cff3a8a9a50ba55c.avif?t=1646396433\" width=600 height=338 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Characters</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1500040/extras/9a43d28c193b0a1f7851089f13f7c070.avif?t=1646396433\" width=600 height=387 /></span><br>Play as Demetri.  He disobeyed an order to try to save the lives of his squadron.  They died, and he ended up court martialed.  He has 20 years hard labor on Secren and thinks he can get by without becoming someone's boyfriend.  It's not like he's a homophobe, he just isn't into dudes--for now.<br><br>Sadly, having to bond with a man may be the least of Demetri's problems.  Planet Secren is a violent and dangerous world.  Things become real for him fast, and he doesn't know what he's going to do.  <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1500040/extras/5253ddc23adfd35bb451308c742468a6.avif?t=1646396433\" width=600 height=387 /></span><br>Helix was the only love interest in the original novel series (who was named Maelstrom) and is the 'cannon' route here.

When he injured his leg he couldn't mine anymore and had to join a biker gang of cannibalistic criminals.  He doesn't like what he's become, and takes drugs to numb his pain.  He'd become clean and walk away from it all for a guy like Demetri.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1500040/extras/0e924ef94b1beca7e14408b220c90c6d.avif?t=1646396433\" width=600 height=387 /></span><br>Zheng Li is the reason Secren is such a terrible planet.  He lives in his lofty fortress above all the suffering.  For him, miners are just disposable assets.  He thinks it's fine for the weak ones to die.  That just lets stronger miners take their place.  Now that he wants Demetri he'll have to open his eyes to how horrible he let things get.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1500040/extras/e0b3d68f4e1fe9cdce2a9a743d404415.avif?t=1646396433\" width=313 height=670 /></span><br>Introducing Sawyer, your FOURTH love interest!  We decided that three just weren't enough.  We've decided to up that to 4 with the introduction of the fired barkeeper Sawyer.
