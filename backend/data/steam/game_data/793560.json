Our art style is inspired by the gorgeous tactical shooter Due Process. ⁽ˡᶦⁿᵏ⁾ Mission objectives and team-play mechanics are similar to the visceral tactical shooter Squad. ⁽ˡᶦⁿᵏ⁾ Weapon handling is similar to the iconic Red Orchestra series. ⁽ˡᶦⁿᵏ⁾ Lastly, our maps are all deeply influenced by the legendary Battlefield 1942.<br><br>Our mission is to create an epic, tactical, large scale, spiritual successor to classic World War II tactical shooters`. We also enjoy single-player games such as Ravenfield ⁽ˡᶦⁿᵏ⁾ and are focusing on creating a robust single-player experience in future updates.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/793560/extras/5d47dd22b89c23d864d5f46a7c8932fe.poster.avif?t=1666814852\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/793560/extras/5d47dd22b89c23d864d5f46a7c8932fe.webm?t=1666814852\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/793560/extras/5d47dd22b89c23d864d5f46a7c8932fe.mp4?t=1666814852\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Warfare 1944 is built by Microprose Software on top of the OHDCore framework for Unreal Engine 4.
