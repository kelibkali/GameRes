    "description": "<strong>Sweep'n'Sweep</strong> is an exciting puzzle game very similar to Minesweeper, but with an upgrade: when you fill a line completely, it disappears and a new empty one appears on the top. Whether you're a hardcore Minesweeper enthusiast or just someone who wants to spend their five-minute break on something fun, this is the game for you.<br><br>As you clear more and more lines, the difficulty increases making it harder and harder to play. Try to beat your friends and reach the highest difficulty level!<br><br>Apart from the obviuos fun gameplay, this game also features a trendy look and plenty of fun achievements. With everything combined, Sweep'n'Sweep will keep you busy for tens of hours!",
