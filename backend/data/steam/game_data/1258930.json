There is no sexual content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTotal play time is expected to be 8 hours (the demo version is about 5 hours).<br />\r\nThe background music is a sophisticated piece of music written by several excellent Japanese composers.<br />\r\nFrom the first time you play, the game has a &quot;Start from any chapter&quot; mode.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory.<br />\r\n　2020, Japan. Boring everyday. Uninspired days. The world is still as rotten as ever.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n　I wish that everything would break down anyway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n　Even if I thought about that, I guess life would go on unchanged.",
