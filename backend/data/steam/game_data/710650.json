    "description": "Conquest of Gerazania is a platform game that is being developed by an Independent Game Development company named Zarkan Entertainment. You will be able to explore the rich story of Gerazania and learn about the Divine Realm and the Mortal Plane and how they interact with each other. The story will primarily take place on Gerazania and you will explore some of the conflicts that exist between the races as they clash for survival.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Elves</h2></h2>One of the original races of Gerazania, the Elves have a natural affinity to magicka, the power that allows the world Gerazania and it's inhabitants to survive. The Shan'Oiel seek to conquer all races they deem lesser than themselves and rule over Gerazania. These Elves feel they are the rightful rulers of the world and that they deserve the right to ascend to Godhood. However, there is a small faction within the races of Elves that do not see things the same way. The Dan'Keril do not agree with the Shan'Oiel's philosophy and their view as every living thing an instrument to a greater power. They seek a balance and peace within the world, they wish to preserve the magicka essence that flows through each living thing and even Gerazania herself.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Kerchadis</h2></h2>The Kerchadis are an amphibian-humanoid race that is amongst the oldest. Their primary kingdom Sitnalta is in the deepest parts of the oceans where nobody has discovered; the only reason the Kerchadis are a known race is because they have recently come ashore onto the small island of Finij. The Kerchadis have a basic understanding of water and air based magicka and there are extremely few and rare Kerchadis that understand fire based magicka. The Kerchadis make for excellent healers and can mend even the grievous of wounds.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Titans</h2></h2>The Titans are a nomadic race and are not separated into any type of tribe. The Titans are a relatively peaceful race and do not attack unless provoked. They do not seek to take sides in any of the wars in Gerazania and prefer to keep to themselves and their traditions. Their bodies are made up of the stone and earth of Gerazania and are powered by magicka in spite of have no understanding for magicka; the shamans of their nomadic herd only utilize the crops and earth of Gerazania for their medicines.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Humans</h2></h2>The race of Humans are a fragile one, the youngest race in the history of Gerazania. They have no affinity to magicka and they only understand simple magicka properties; enough for farming and raising livestock. However, the Humans are not rivaled by any other race for their ability to make the best armors and weapons. There are a multitude of tribes and kingdoms belonging to the Human race, however there are three main kingdoms that wholly represent all of humanity; Kingdom Sharala, Kingdom Trejun, and Kingdom Derunv.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Zarkonid</h2></h2>The Zarkonid horde are a brutal race, they only follow commands from the queen of their horde. They do not understand the concept of magicka and survive by devouring the earth and magicka of Gerazania, but that does not stop their thirst for flesh and blood. Nobody knows how the Zarkonid came to be; many think that are atrocities created by the recent overflow of magicka due to the Elves rising in power and abusing the magicka of Gerazania.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Severithian</h2></h2>The Severithian are an avian-humanoid race and are segregated into tribes. However, many of the Severithian tribes have been enslaved by the tyrannical Elves. Now, they are no more than property and used as tools for building and serving the Shan'Oiel empire. The Severithian have no natural affinity to magicka and are not very skilled in combat in any manner; their only advantage is that they are able to fly due to their avian features.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Divine Realm</h2></h2>The Divine Realm is a plane that exists parallel to the Mortal Plane. In the Divine Realm consist all manner of magical creatures such as Fae, Nymphs, Abyss Creatures, and all other oddities. However, the main thing for the mortals to worry about in the Divine Realm are the Divine Beings. These Beings have awesome unlimited magical abilities and can either create or destroy life and space as they see fit.",
