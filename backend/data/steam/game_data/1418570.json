    "description": "Zen Trails is a relaxing, simple sand box in which you can do only one thing: draw lines. When you press play, the lines rotate to create beautiful designs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are no puzzles, no objectives. It's simply an environment in which you can create beautiful spirographs, set to the most zen-inducing music and visuals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nZen Trails is very effective at relaxing and inspiring, as well as reducing anxiety. It gives the mind something to focus on which is low pressure yet still stimulating with a small amount of gentle math and a very satisfying payoff when seeing your designs come to life. And for those players who lived through the 90's, perhaps a little nostalgia if they ever played with a spirograph maker. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI'm a solo dev and I really hope you enjoy this little project of mine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n- Intuitive click and drag design process<br />\r\n- Community Hub where you can upload and download designs made by other players<br />\r\n- Robust tutorial, including tips for making designs beautiful<br />\r\n- Copy-paste<br />\r\n- Unlimited undo steps<br />\r\n- All possible colors<br />\r\n- Unlimited line thickness<br />\r\n- Save and load designs<br />\r\n- autosave<br />\r\n- Light weight, can run on low end machines.<br />\r\n- Very relaxing music",
