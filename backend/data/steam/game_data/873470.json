Certain buildings have Illegal variants that completely break the rules and provide their owner with a massive advantage: For example, while a Hospital might attract injured people and net you a clean profit, an <strong><i>ILLEGAL </i></strong>Hospital will kill those patients and take all their money and add them to your bank account.<br><br>In Zero Sum Future, you can only win if you master the art of sneaking in illegal buildings and can spot those placed by your competition.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES</h2><br>Because Zero Sum Future doesn't stop you from doing anything you want, the possibilities are endless. Do you want slowly replace a large portion of your human workforce with robots? Force-feed your colonists junk food and watch them swarm your hospitals with heart conditions? Bribe the central government to only allow you to trade on a certain planet? Establish a workforce planet with lousy living conditions but cheap labor?<br><br>And establish dominance over your friends in the process?<br><br>Only in Zero Sum Future.",
