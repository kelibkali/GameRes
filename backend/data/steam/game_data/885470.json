    "description": "Wire up electrical circuits and make your way through a derelict building to keep your appointment with a mysterious professor who lives at the top.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWired is an atmospheric puzzle-platformer set in a derelict building which has remained untouched since the 1970s. In each room, you will wire up the lifts, doors, switches and fuel cells in order to get through. The puzzle mechanics are built on an accurate model of how electricity behaves and as you progress through the game you will solve problems that are not usually encountered until A-level physics. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThroughout the game, you encounter cine projector screens giving information you need in order to progress and slowly unravelling the mystery of who you are, why you are there and why the professor built this strange thing in the first place.",
