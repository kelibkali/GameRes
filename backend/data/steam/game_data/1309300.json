    "description": "Ominous is a captivating 2D pixel art adventure platformer that takes you on a mystical journey through the world’s most enigmatic locations. You’ll step into the shoes of Gowan McDerrick, a decorated British soldier from the Edwardian era, as he pursues ancient artifacts and uncovers secrets that span from Mongolian monasteries to Mayan tombs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSet against the backdrop of Great Britain’s Edwardian period, Gowan’s adventure begins with an invitation from an old friend and former commander, Brigadier-General Sir Edward Bellingham. Sir Edward, who mysteriously disappeared for ten days during the Second Boer War, returned a changed man after being found miles from where he vanished, his spine broken and his spirit darkened. Obsessed with an ancient Egyptian manuscript discovered in the tombs beneath the lost city of Kweneng, Sir Edward’s invitation leads Gowan down a path filled with intrigue, mysticism, and self-discovery.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGowan, now faced with the choice of rejoining the army or venturing into unknown realms, takes a room in a humble dosshouse along the Thames, contemplating his future. What unfolds is a tale of exploration, history, and the supernatural, where every step forward brings Gowan closer to unveiling the mysteries that bind the past and the present.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEmbark on this extraordinary journey, where the boundaries of reality blur, and discover the truth behind the artifacts that have the power to change the course of history. Ominous is more than just a game—it's an experience that challenges both mind and spirit.",
