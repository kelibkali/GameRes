    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>It's Only Money</strong> is a 3rd person open world simulation game where you take the role of an Undercity resident – someone forced to live amongst the sewers and subways by the newly elected evil Mayor.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Along with other Undercity residents, you will venture to the surface to steal, fight and destroy. Take down corporations owned by the Mayor’s corrupt cohorts. Win back the city for everyone, block by block. Buy houses, businesses, clothes, cars and whatever else your materialistic heart desires. Play alone or bring up to three friends to share in the chaos. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1415220/extras/3155ffaa292842db44f8314c8ca657b3.poster.avif?t=1765411806\" width=616 height=320 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1415220/extras/3155ffaa292842db44f8314c8ca657b3.webm?t=1765411806\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span>Rockhaven is your playground. Explore a dynamic city filled with shops, houses, activities, and missions. Unleash your creativity as you exploit the open world to your advantage: pickpocket the wealthy, steal cars for a wild joyride, or jack a UFO and take it for a spin! Test your combat skills with new moves available at the Dojo, or take on the Mayor’s inner circle in epic Takeover missions, including boss fights against his lieutenants.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Feeling tactical? Recruit Homies from the Undercity, who follow, fight, and contribute to your street misdeeds, making every heist more thrilling.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1415220/extras/03f165bd63df495e01b6c850e982a0dc.poster.avif?t=1765411806\" width=616 height=320 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1415220/extras/03f165bd63df495e01b6c850e982a0dc.webm?t=1765411806\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span>As you claw back cash from the city’s elite, use your ill-gotten gains to purchase homes and businesses. Every house you buy brings more people back from the Undercity to the surface, allowing you to customise their living spaces for gameplay buffs and unique items. Invest in properties like the landlord you’ve always wanted to be. Become the 1%! Profit off the land and contribute nothing to society! Concentration of wealth? Sounds like a poor people problem.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Business ownership isn’t just about money; it’s about power. Manage the Slimeway to create a steady income stream and unlock new gameplay opportunities. Want more action? Rake in cash, REP, and other rewards when you dive into some of the city’s tantalising, <i>minimum wage earning </i>side-hustle minigames.Hustling for a wage too boring for you? We got you covered. Go bigger with the latest addition to Rockhaven’s underground scene - the 'Metro Dungeon'. A roguelite experience where every wave of enemies brings more upgrades and strange powers to make you feel absolutely unstoppable.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1415220/extras/4b8fcd855bba4be873b2db38ebaf70be.poster.avif?t=1765411806\" width=616 height=320 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1415220/extras/4b8fcd855bba4be873b2db38ebaf70be.webm?t=1765411806\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span>Make your mark on Rockhaven not only by dressing the best but also with fully customisable vehicles. Whether you're tweaking the headlight colour, installing hydraulics for jumps, or kitting out your ride with NOS, the possibilities are endless, with millions of part combinations. Unlock new parts by jacking and crushing cars around the city, then bring them back to your garage to build the wildest ride Rockhaven has ever seen. Just remember - without a seatbelt, crashing will send you flying.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1415220/extras/a3f5e67d3ddc8b55ffc112f28b26fc77.poster.avif?t=1765411806\" width=616 height=320 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1415220/extras/a3f5e67d3ddc8b55ffc112f28b26fc77.webm?t=1765411806\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><strong>It's Only Money</strong> is a playground for you and up to three friends. Steal together, fight together, and complete missions together - or just hang out in the Slimeway and gamble away your hard-earned cash on snail racing. If competition is more your style, dive into various PvP microgames like Prop Hunt or Gorb Rush, where you're thrown into a giant orb and tasked with being the last one standing on a sky high platform.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1415220/extras/5bee380ae4dc02779e9119c94d77d607.poster.avif?t=1765411806\" width=616 height=320 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1415220/extras/5bee380ae4dc02779e9119c94d77d607.webm?t=1765411806\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span>With tons of new content, including expanded player upgrades, new missions, and enhanced vehicle systems, Rockhaven is yours to take back. The Mayor took everything from you - now it’s time for payback.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Enjoy the ride, cause chaos, and, most importantly, reclaim what's yours.</p>",
