Surrounded by seven nations each harbouring it's own unique race, the inn acts as an important hub between them.<br />\r\nTry to meet their wishes and fulfill their desires while also maintaining a keen view at your finances and storage. Offer tired travellers a place to spend the night but keep in mind they might not like their roommate.<br />\r\nCook delicious food, serve your guests and most importantly take notes in a game which you have most likely never seen before.",
