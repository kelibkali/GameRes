To open the doors that block your way you must uncover the keys that belong to them! But sadly for you the keys are hidden behind puzzle bound objects. To uncover the keys and earn your freedom you must solve the puzzles! These puzzles are <strong>very challenging</strong> and will test you to the limit!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2>-<strong> Challenging puzzles:</strong> Many puzzles require your real world knowledge to solve! Also some knowledge of the Lord of the Rings would give you an edge! <br>- <strong>No hand holding:</strong> In this game you won't get any tips other than the instruction on the screen. All else you need to figure out yourself. So it will be a real challenge!<br>- <strong>Interactive world:</strong> There are some objects you can interact with during the game, it's up to you to find out how!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Hint:</h2>Use the alphabet and sometimes google might help you solve the puzzles!<br><br>To interact with objects you can use &quot;e&quot; and your left mouse button!",
