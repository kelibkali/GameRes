    "description": "Resolutiion was developed by two angry German brothers over five years, without any prior game design knowledge,or experience in pixel art.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver 270 pages, Polychromatic collects the art of Resolutiion from prototype ideas and sketches to final assets and promotional material. It captures the brothers’ game-dev journey and reveals how mad musings evolved into madder characters, and vibrant pixels shaped vast landscapes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt’s a chance for everyone to study, learn, and enjoy the process of making video games, Polychromatic is a manifesto on human creation: if these guys can craft their own digital realm, so can anybody.",
