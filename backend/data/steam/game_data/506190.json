Rumours abound as to his true identity. Some say he is the living incarnation of Snorri Longbeard himself; others that he was betrothed to the goddess Valaya, protector and bestower of magical resistance. Either way, he is a powerful living symbol of hope and pride for the Dwarfs and, in times of dire need, he may appear in the flesh to help the Dawi through their tribulations.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Unique quests</h2><br>Like all Legendary Lords, Grombrindal unlocks a series of unique quests as he levels up, each of which rewards him with his legendary wargear.
