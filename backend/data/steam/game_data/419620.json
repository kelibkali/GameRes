    "description": "This tutorial teaches you how to quickly sculpt and design 3 rough creature busts in ZBrush using block-out techniques. We review them and pick one design to take to final sculpt in ZBrush and learn how to render and light for final presentation of your model using Keyshot and Photoshop. The creature design and inspiration lecture provides a quick primer on basic creature design theory. Emphasis is put on design and exploring ideas using ZBrush as a tool. In the later chapters, we learn how to sculpt secondary to tertiary (micro-detail) forms.<br><br>This video tutorial covers every step of the process and shows you how to create the final creature model using various techniques.
