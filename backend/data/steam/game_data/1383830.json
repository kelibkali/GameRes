    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Welcome to Breadbox Game Pack</h2><br>This game pack includes 2 games at the moment and we are currently working on an updated and finished version of the game which will be free to play. Everyone who supported the development of Breadbox until the point of release will be given something special to show that they were early adopters. This version of the game that is up currently is still a fairly functional game. However the updated version will be miles ahead of the state the game is in currently.<br><br>This game is multiplayer over steam but uses room codes and Twitch chat integration so that you can play with friends or live stream viewers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Current Games</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Greedy Bread - A game of trust, or lack thereof...<br>If the majority of players take the bread they will explode, however if the players that take the bread are not the majority, the players who didn't take the bread will explode. If there is no majority, the players who did not take the bread will explode. Be the last bread standing to win or explode with the rest of your bread buddies.<br>The rounds continue until there is one person left, or everyone’s dead.<br></li><li> Breadstick Banter - The game of democracy and quick comedy...<br>The players all receive the same prompt that they will have to respond to. After all of the responses are in, they will verse each other and be voted on by all of the players in the match. This game mode also supports Twitch chat integration where the Twitch chat is able to play along by typing in left to choose the response on the left and right for the response on the right. The winner moves on to verse the next response and the loser will explode.</li></ul>",
