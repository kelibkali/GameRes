    "description": "Kidgilantes is a crafty couch co-op for two players. You and your friend will have to dress up as adults and go on an adventure to save all the animals from their enclosures! Hiding from the pesky zoo guards will be the kids' hardest task, meaning you must run through broken fences, take cover in bushes, and stack up to stay out of sight. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1383290/extras/6bfd32c2d87d03ca3fad930d5482db1e.poster.avif?t=1600836245\" width=500 height=282 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1383290/extras/6bfd32c2d87d03ca3fad930d5482db1e.webm?t=1600836245\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1383290/extras/6bfd32c2d87d03ca3fad930d5482db1e.mp4?t=1600836245\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>The best way to sneak by guards is by stacking up! Kids can get together and stand on each other's shoulders, donning a trenchcoat, hat, and not-so-obvious sunglasses to complete the perfect adult getup. Stacking is not only good for sly sneaking, it helps kids reach brand new heights they've never seen before! <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1383290/extras/095dc77f6cee0d1e832d0e9a105f7a38.poster.avif?t=1600836245\" width=500 height=282 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1383290/extras/095dc77f6cee0d1e832d0e9a105f7a38.webm?t=1600836245\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1383290/extras/095dc77f6cee0d1e832d0e9a105f7a38.mp4?t=1600836245\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>There are lots of animals that need saving, so kids will travel through various vibrant zoos to save animals such as polar bears, toucans, and more! No kids and no animals can be left behind in Kidgilantes, because cooperation and coordination are key. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1383290/extras/b8f880b56cf089d427068a937b0dcabc.poster.avif?t=1600836245\" width=500 height=282 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1383290/extras/b8f880b56cf089d427068a937b0dcabc.webm?t=1600836245\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1383290/extras/b8f880b56cf089d427068a937b0dcabc.mp4?t=1600836245\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Kidgilantes consists of feel-good and intuitive controls, made for anyone of all ages. The single player tutorial provides an interesting introduction to the core gameplay, but the real test comes with how well two players can work together! Each zesty zoo is guarded differently so kids will need to stay in constant communication to help those birds fly free.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1383290/extras/55de398e182b8b82e695ceb377d6abea.poster.avif?t=1600836245\" width=500 height=282 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1383290/extras/55de398e182b8b82e695ceb377d6abea.webm?t=1600836245\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1383290/extras/55de398e182b8b82e695ceb377d6abea.mp4?t=1600836245\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
