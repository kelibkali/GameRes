    "description": "Not all vehicles are fast. Not all of them look streamlined. But there is a particular vehicle type, that is slow and looks very differently: it's called street sweeper. Try it and believe me: cleaning was never such a fun!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt does a unique task - it cleans the streets of a city. It's is not only a commodity, but an important health issue as well. Cleaning the streets requires a different kind of skill set. Of course, as you are racing against the time, speed is very important. But most important is strategic planning where and how to begin to clean and how to proceed to get the best result.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour fuel empties quickly, your Waste collector fills nearly as quickly - plan well not to return to the base doing the cleaning, because then you loose a lot of valuable time. And when you earned enough money get a bigger and better sweeper!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo prepare yourself, go to the city with the best sweeper vehicle possible and clean all those streets - for the benefit of the society and for fun never seen before!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n• Nice looking 3D town area<br />\r\n• 6 cleaning vehicles<br />\r\n• 36 cleaning missions<br />\r\n• vehicle upgrades for better cleaning performance<br />\r\n• Tilt or directional arrow controls<br />\r\n• Easy but still fun to play",
