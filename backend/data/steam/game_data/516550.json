Freely move around and interract with the world using the motion controllers.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Complete freedom to explore your surroundings: Move around without restraints, from floors to walls and ceilings to explore a series of environments.<br></li><li>Tranform the surroundings: Lifts, bridges, doors and huge sections of the landscape may be moved to form new paths through this mysterious world.<br></li><li>Interract with the inhabitants of this strange land: Killer robots, face hugging crabs, dragons all stand in your way. Some may be avoided by move the landscape, others require stealth or maybe you'll grab a laser pistol to deal with them.<br></li><li>Enjoy a world built in areas linked together by teleporters you must power up. Many areas contain multiple teleports giving you freedom to choose your own path.<br></li><li>Customise the controls to suit your taste: Choose between teleportation for a comfortable experience, or trackpad controls for a more roller coaster feel as you transfer from floors to the walls.</li></ul>",
