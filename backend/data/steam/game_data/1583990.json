    "description": "Waking up in a room full of light, NoName #1892 is thrust into fighting countless monsters to stay alive without any memory of who he is or why this is happening to him. All he knows is that he has to keep moving forward. He has to keep fighting so that maybe, just maybe, he’ll find answers to his questions and find rest in a place that he can call home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith a classic top-down style 2D game and a slight twist on the traditional RPG, Awakening the Light takes the familiar dungeon crawler and emphasizes the power of choice for the player to progress through the game. Fighting enemies and even bosses are now optional. However, don’t be fooled into thinking that it will be a breeze if you choose to take the shorter route! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey features:<br />\r\n       -Customizable look of main character<br />\r\n       -Deep, resonating story of NoName #1892’s journey to find answers to his most critical questions about life and truth<br />\r\n       -Multiple weapons and spells to use to take out dozens of kinds of enemies<br />\r\n       -Immersive soundtrack",
