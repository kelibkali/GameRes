Upgrading financial buildings increases their gold yield, and upgrading military buildings increases the starting level of units produced with that building. Each faction has its own special building which, in addition to producing gold, can produce a unique special unit with varying abilities.<br><br>When commanding your army to march on a territory you do not own, you will seize control if it is undefended or engage in a fierce battle with the defending army. In the battle map, you will prepare your units by strategically placing them on your side of the map. When both players are ready, you will take turns maneuvering the battlefield to eliminate all enemy units.",
