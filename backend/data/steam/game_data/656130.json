But the ad hoc regent council refused and Erik was made King of Eromott regardless of his young age.<br><br>The Duke, in a fury, mustered an army of 10,000 men, consisting mostly of Saxons, then set forth to take the kingdom by force.<br><br>Two years later, Duke Lukion had conquered most of Eromott and vanquished most of King Erik's armies.  Victory was surely in the Dukes hands.<br><br>One night, a mysterious old man appeared before Erik in his chambers and bestowed upon him a beautiful golden scepter crowned with the largest ruby he'd ever seen.  The man claimed that the scepter had mystical powers as it was imbued with the souls of his ancestors... Erik's royal line.  The old man added, that the scepter could only be used at night.<br><br>With this mighty weapon in hand, King Erik set forth to vanquish his uncles armies and restore peace to the kingdom once and for all.<br><br>By himself.",
