    "description": "With motorsports temples such as Hockenheim, Silverstone, Nürburgring and Spa-Francorchamps already represented in our Premium Track Pack, the fifth track could only be one: the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza, host of the Italian GP since the very first world championship in 1950 with the sole exception of 1980, now available for Automobilista 2!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe historic value of Monza goes well beyond F1, as a regular staple on the calendar of the most prestigious international racing series through the decades. The modern track remains an unique high-speed challenge to this day, with the long straights being broken up by tight chicanes putting a premium on horsepower, braking precision and traction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Monza DLC will feature the modern version of the circuit along with a few of historical variants representing this classic venue through the decades - the dauntingly fast 1971 layout (the last one before the introduction of chicanes), as well as the one combining with the old oval and its insane banking - which even though hasn´t been raced in anger for decades now remains mostly intact to this day as a testament to the bravery of drivers from yesteryear.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Monza DLC will also feature the 1991 layout with the original high speed Lesmos offering almost no run-off area before their 1994 sanitization, as well as the double Retiffilo and faster Della Roggia chicanes from pre-2000 reform along with their challenging high curbs.",
