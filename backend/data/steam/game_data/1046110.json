    "description": "Shadow Runner is a speedrun-oriented platformer, where you must master three gameplay elements simultaneously to finish the level in the shortest possible time.<br />\r\nUse the classical dash and double jump to move between the platforms, and make the most of your grapple when possible.<br />\r\nBeware, as your character cannot stay in the light or in shadows without you manually switching which side you want. <br />\r\nControl the position of the sun to create the most efficient path to complete the level.<br />\r\nUnderstand these three gameplay mechanics and transform them into reflexes to finish in the shortest amount of time.",
