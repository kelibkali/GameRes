    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > Starfinder Adventure Path #37: The White Glove Affair (Fly Free or Die 4 of 6)</h2>The crew of the<br><i> Oliphaunt</i> have been living paycheck to paycheck for too long; now they've got a chance to become richer than they've ever imagined... by stealing one of the Kalistocracy's legendary treasure barges! But this heist turns out to be more than anyone bargained for when the crew ends up stranded on a hidden resort in the Drift where Kalistocrats outbid each other for the plundered wealth of the galaxy. The only way off this rock is to win the auction, steal the keys to the commerce barge, and outrun both the competition and the law!<br>&quot;The White Glove Affair&quot; is a Starfinder adventure for four 7th-level characters. This adventure continues the Fly Free or Die Adventure Path, a six-part monthly campaign in which players take on the role of a merchant crew with an experimental starship, trying to get rich, escape interplanetary assassins, and outwit their rivals. This volume also includes a series of &quot;Side Jobs&quot;--short mini-adventures the GM can insert into the campaign at any time--and shines a spotlight on the Prophecies of Kalistrade, including the golden commerce barges that carry their treasure off to Fortune's Heart, a secret auction house in the Drift.<br>Each monthly full-color softcover Starfinder Adventure Path volume contains a new installment of a series of interconnected science-fantasy quests that together create a fully developed plot of sweeping scale and epic challenges.
