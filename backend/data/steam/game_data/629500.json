    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Hellfrost: Siege of Watch Gap Fort</strong></h2><i>War Has Come to Watchgap Fort!</i><br><i>With night falling, the strong walls of Watchgap Fort offer sanctuary, somewhere to sleep in peace and eat a hot meal. Or so you thought, for no sooner have the heroes settled down when an alarm is raised -- a goblin army is besieging Watchgap Fort!</i><br>This adventure simulates a mass battle on the tabletop. Spread over several days, each scene is the equivalent of a Mass Battle combat round, giving the heroes fist hand of experience of the battlefield.<br>Victory will be determined not by spoils or bodycounts, but by survival. Those who stand and fight this dark day will have their reputations assured, but should the heroes fall the gateway is open to the rest of Heligioland, and perhaps even the Hearthlands.<br>Will you answer the call to arms, or will your courage fail you when it is most needed?<br>This adventure can be played as a continuation of Shadow of Darkness or as a standalone adventure.<br><strong>Requires the Hellfrost Players Guide</strong><br><i>Fantasy Grounds Conversion:</i> <strong>Kevin Doswell</strong><br><strong>Requirements:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Savage Worlds ruleset.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Kevin Doswell</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
