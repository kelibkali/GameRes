    "description": "Lucifer Lives in Lower Manhattan is a Visual Novel with non-linear game play and a subtle love letter to classic adventure games of the 80s and 90s.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Story</h2>It's the early 1940s, and you've been invited to an apartment building in Greenwich Village, NYC in the west side of Lower Manhattan. Immediately upon arriving, you are thrust into a murder mystery which is on you to solve, discovering all types of unique individuals along the way.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Style</h2>All backgrounds, characters and UI were custom created by a team of talented artists. The game has a noir style mixed with a traditional art aesthetic.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Experience</h2>Along with being a familiar format to other Visual Novel games, Lucifer Lives in Lower Manhattan also contains some classic adventure mechanics such as click-and-point backgrounds (without the pain of pixel-hunting), combining inventory items and non-linear game play.",
