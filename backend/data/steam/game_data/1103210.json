    "description": "<strong>WE BECOME WHAT WE BEHOLD </strong><br><i>&quot;&quot; game about news cycles, vicious cycles, infinite cycles&quot;</i><br><br>We Become What We Behold is a 5 minute game that looks at how social media magnifies small differences into gross monstrosities. It is a non-partisan game about politics, examining the horror of the viral nature of divisiveness and tribalism.<br><br>The player captures “news,” controlling what the circles and squares see on a screen and having sway over how they think and act.<br><br>warning: the following program contains scenes of snobbery, rudeness &amp; mass murder. Viewer discretion is advised.<br><br>This games was created and originally published by Nicky Case (this is not an official port from him). You can find the original web version at this link:<br>",
