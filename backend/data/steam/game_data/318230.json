You travel with your combat vehicles and convoy across a wasteland to find parts needed to repair your broken spaceship. During your journey you will encounter strangers in randomized scenarios by picking up radio signals.<br><br>Depending on the choices you make, signals can either lead to tactical combat, text based dialogue or chance based role-play. Whatever choice you make, you need to keep your convoy and its cargo safe from raiders, privateers and other enemies. Keep upgrading your vehicles, as death is permanent in Convoy. <br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>A new take on tactical combat:</strong> Combat plays out in real time as a high-speed car chase where you need to position your units and use abilities to maximise their effectiveness. <br></li><li>    <strong>Exploration pays:</strong> You will encounter many different radio signals, each with a text based event.
