Take a careful approach to platforming or go for speed! Somersaults boost your speed as well as your jumps, allowing Pixa to blaze through levels in a way speed runners are sure to love. Each level has a time attack and deathless challenge as well.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2023530/extras/d32cdb1c40ceadc297920b96fb077a83.poster.avif?t=1719486162\" width=600 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2023530/extras/d32cdb1c40ceadc297920b96fb077a83.webm?t=1719486162\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2023530/extras/d32cdb1c40ceadc297920b96fb077a83.mp4?t=1719486162\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Explore the World and Discover Your Magic</strong><br>You'll quickly enhance Pixa's base move set, unlocking the first three of 12 abilities in the first level. Somewhat of a hybrid between traditional platformers and metrodvanias, Pixa's Quest's mostly linear levels are connected by a world map. Similar to games like Mega Man X and Shovel Knight, you'll find special abilities inside of levels that will enhance your platforming or offensive capabilities. Re-exploring earlier levels with new abilities or items might lead you to new paths forward, or new story points. However, if you're not into that, you can also run through the game like a traditional linear platformer. <br><br>Unlike most metroidvanias, your platforming abilities, such as double jumps, aerial dash, fall speed control, and more, are front loaded towards the first part of the game. This way you'll have to utilize and master your abilities to conquer the game. Abilities are limited by your mana but are quickly recharged by defeating enemies.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2023530/extras/2c4412fcacda9f13b065737df9fa58b0.poster.avif?t=1719486162\" width=600 height=240 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2023530/extras/2c4412fcacda9f13b065737df9fa58b0.webm?t=1719486162\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2023530/extras/2c4412fcacda9f13b065737df9fa58b0.mp4?t=1719486162\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Treasure Abounds</strong><br>Show off your skills by finding and collecting treasures in each level that can be traded in town for all sorts of upgrades, including new weapons, equipment, and health and magic expansions.
