These abilities charge up as you kill enemies, and allow you short windows of massive power once activated. Each skill tree has its own unique Super.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >LEGENDARIES</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Legendary items can drop at any time, and provide unique and powerful ways to play and build your character.

Excel and gain access to Raid bosses which will test your build, reflexes, and strategy against unique and difficult encounters. Infinite Arena pits your character against waves of increasingly difficult enemies and bosses for a chance to top the leaderboards. All of these can be done solo and with a party. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >&quot;I WAS TOLD I COULD DUAL WIELD SHIELDS?&quot;</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Yes.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101400/extras/ce2f4c5ae7f15a62f8e665b6398e8cef.avif?t=1744249871\" width=582 height=846 /></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >&quot;CAN I PLAY AS A SUMMONER?&quot;</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Yes.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101400/extras/7f4d66c5d95c7f7a8aed1752e45e3170.avif?t=1744249871\" width=614 height=336 /></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Many of RK's skills, talents, weapons, and features originated as suggestions by players like you.
