    "description": "<strong>You must own the STEAM version of Music Creator or SONAR to use this DLC</strong><br><br>The Prophet-600 was a low-cost synthesizer based on the legendary Prophet-5 and was the world’s first synthesizer with a MIDI interface. It had six voices and the same Curtis synthesizer chips used in the Prophet-5. The envelopes and LFO were generated by the computer, and an arpeggiator and a 400-note polyphonic sequencer were also added to sweeten the deal.",
