    "description": "Third Person Perspective arcade game. Defend your base against hordes of aliens intent on taking over our Solar System.<br><br><br>When I was a lad, games were real games. TV was violent, with plenty of swearing and stereotyping and - most importantly - &quot;THINGS EXPLODING&quot;. Computer graphics weren't quite as good, but we made up for it with our imaginations!  But now you have to imagine no longer. The past has come back (for better or worse). Sol Galactic Defender is the old arcade shooter brought up to date with even bigger technicolour EXPLOSIONS. <br>Forget the stress balls, shooting things is far more stress relieving, especially when they explode. And as aliens aren't real, it is also politically correct - as well as morally acceptable!<br>A ballet of sound and colour, art in its highest form. WAR!<br><br>Now with even more &quot;feel good&quot; factor, as the first level is to play for free, as opposed to &quot;free to play&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Main Key Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li></li></ul><strong><br>*Shooting &quot;Despicable&quot; Aliens which explode with great panache!<br><br>*Different alien weapons including homing missiles.<br><br>*Retro game HUD and player life mechanic<br><br>*1980s Arcade Game shooting mechanic.<br><br>*Original Music Score and Sound FX.<br><br>*Sounds Optimized for woofer speakers.<br><br>*Extra lives and Base lives power pills.<br><br>*8 levels located on different planets in our solar system.<br><br>*Glossary of Aliens<br><br>*Interesting Information about each planet!</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >General overview</h2><br>As the player, you have a Hover tank and 3 lives. You shoot missiles which take time to reach their target. This is meant to simulate the old 2D arcade shooters. Your movement is restricted to an area around your base which normally has destructible defences on the periphery.<br><br> Various Aliens attack in waves, firing missiles at you, your base and defences. Different aliens have different attacks, some of these home in on you, some on your base. To counter these, you have flairs to confuse their targeting computers.<br><br>You must defend your base which has a number of lives (except on level 1). On some levels there are also shield bases. These provide the power for the shields around your base, if destroyed the shield drops and your base may be attacked. Different aliens have different weapons. Some of these will target you some your base.<br><br> On most levels the player shooting mechanism is confined to a single plane. This means that if an alien jumps you can no longer shoot him. On higher levels this mechanic is removed and I experiment with different variants of the shooting mechanism. This is one of the things I would like to get feedback on, and experiment with during the early access. <br><br>On level 6 I introduce a wave mechanic for the floor, i.e. your floating on a sea of very hot water. In this level there is an auto targeting feature, which is toggle on and off. This works on some aliens but not others whom have &quot;STEALTH&quot;",
