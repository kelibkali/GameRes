    "description": "Loosly based on WW2, you take control of your choice of plane (spitfire, lightning or zero). Try to survive as long as possible by dodging bullets and planes. The roll, canon and rockets will be needed on harder difficulties.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA side scrolling shooter with a bullet hell influence.<br />\r\nDoes it explode? Yes. Everything does. Enemies show their battle damage through having chunks be blown off. There are multiple enemies all with unique behaviours, all which are designed in junction with each other.<br />\r\nAs you get more kills an upgrade will spawn, this makes your weapons better in different ways.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnly a survival mode is available but a full game mode is planned.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMenus are in English only, though this may be updated.",
