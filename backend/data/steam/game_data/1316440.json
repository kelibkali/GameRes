Now, after selling his belongings and getting some money, he decides to buy a small cabin on an island in the South Pacific. You will be able to meet the people of this island, their customs and you will look for an occupation.<br><br>If you could just… close your eyes for a moment, breathe and open them again to realize that you’re in a different place… A place where the air is fresh and the sky is blue, a serene getaway free of the complexities of day-to-day social interaction, where your responsibilities are as simple as “eat”, “water the crops”, “go for a drive”. More than anything, a place that you can call your own.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1316440/extras/e3c0c8e6e7dae987bd5d7a727dab2e88.poster.avif?t=1712897256\" width=600 height=336 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1316440/extras/e3c0c8e6e7dae987bd5d7a727dab2e88.webm?t=1712897256\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1316440/extras/e3c0c8e6e7dae987bd5d7a727dab2e88.mp4?t=1712897256\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>This is Lonefarm.<br><br>In this fully immersive escape from anxiety, you take control of a farm on a small island in the middle of the South Pacific.
