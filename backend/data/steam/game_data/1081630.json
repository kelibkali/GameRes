As you play along and explore treasures, you’ll surprisingly found out all the weapons or abilities are based on Urban Dictionary (Agglomerate etc). For further developments, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA game of mystery and surprise as you face different challenges and experience each run. <br />\r\nAs a lone adventure, you will find yourself in an endless dungeon filled with grotesque creatures.
