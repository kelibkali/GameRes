To catch the fishes he enchants them by playing his banjo. Hit the numerical buttons on the keyboard following the beat to score (and to collect his diner).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >ORIGINAL CONCEPT</h2><br>A fishing game or a rhythm game? Why not both?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >RETRO VISUALS</h2><br>Pixel art animations and environments give the game an unique feel for this genre.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >BEAUTIFUL SONGS</h2><br>Amazing songs composed by Peritune. All inspired by classic Japanese melodies with instruments like the Shamisen.",
