    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > Radical Spectrum Volume 2 is an arcade-style platformer, featuring constant, endless action. </h2>With over 10,000 unique levels and 4 bosses governing each one with their own set of weapons, every new attempt will be a new experience. <br><br>RSV2 was made for instant drop-in-and-play action; there's nothing between you and the core experience. It's a distilled and efficient platforming playground with infinitely increasing difficult, multiple playable characters, boss battles, powerups, and probably lots and lots (and lots) of dying.<br><br>Doc DuBrane is gearing up once again to save Nucleusport. After a crushing defeat, the reckless alien Prince FaceBox and his minions have relocated to the in-construction Sine Wave Tower, the tallest building ever (almost) built. <br><br>Their heinous mission? To dump all the radioactive waste from their own planets on an already highly-irradiated Earth. Doc, using the genius invention the Prisma Cannon, is the only one who can climb the tower and stop those stupid jerks. So get out your haz-mat suit, finish whatever it is you were doing, and get ready to get radical.<br><br>Main Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Instant, endless platforming<br></li><li> Infinitely increasing difficulty<br></li><li> Over 10,000 unique levels<br></li><li> 5 playable characters<br></li><li> 4 radical boss fights<br></li><li> A killer soundtrack by Bit Level Up<br></li><li> Gamepad support</li></ul>",
