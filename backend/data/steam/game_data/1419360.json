    "description": "You uncover an ancient artifact that grants you telekinetic powers, and in doing so awaken its guardians to prove your worth as its wielder. <br><br>Hyper Psychic Gauntlets is an unorthodox VR bullet hell where you have nothing but two telekinetic gauntlets to defend yourself against the guardians of the temple. Dodge lasers, deflect bullets and throw around enemies as you prove you're worthy as the wielder of the gauntlets. Between split second thinking  deciding whether to dodge or deflect and the constant movement needed to weave yourself around lasers and bullets, you'll be drowning in sweat by the time you take off your headset.<br><br> <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1419360/extras/df307cb2800fae98777b6a621a0e8223.webp?t=1607014411\" width=612 height=56 /></span><br>There's no limit on how many objects you can hold at once, as long as it's within your ray, you can grab it.<br><br> <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1419360/extras/7b947273a21524f0350cfbdf4a8469d4.poster.avif?t=1607014411\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1419360/extras/7b947273a21524f0350cfbdf4a8469d4.webm?t=1607014411\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1419360/extras/7b947273a21524f0350cfbdf4a8469d4.mp4?t=1607014411\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br> <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1419360/extras/ef8eb8a702099b92193d345bd6f0fd8b.webp?t=1607014411\" width=612 height=56 /></span><br>Grab enemies to put them under your control and turn them into temporary weapons.<br><br> <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1419360/extras/713bc1e3e6b6a2cc7f28eddd7c05b9af.poster.avif?t=1607014411\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1419360/extras/713bc1e3e6b6a2cc7f28eddd7c05b9af.webm?t=1607014411\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1419360/extras/713bc1e3e6b6a2cc7f28eddd7c05b9af.mp4?t=1607014411\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br> <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1419360/extras/c7e0f517fa1d15e008a25f1d9778576c.webp?t=1607014411\" width=612 height=56 /></span><br>Rise the rankings as you play through 4 stages, 2 boss fights and 2 endless mode stages. Normal mode is where you'll really be flailing your arms around feeling the adrenaline but if you don't like dying constantly each stage has it's own Casual mode with a different spawnset. And I should probably mention this now, but both the guardians and you die in one hit, so be prepared to die a lot.<br><br><br><br><br> <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1419360/extras/26ce6c14238dea2f78c991b332727e32.webp?t=1607014411\" width=612 height=24 /></span><br> HPG supports mixed-reality and avatars through LIV, click here to see how to set it up. <br> <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1419360/extras/26ce6c14238dea2f78c991b332727e32.webp?t=1607014411\" width=612 height=24 /></span>",
