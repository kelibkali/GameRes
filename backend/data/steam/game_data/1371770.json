    "description": "Come play the new-and-improved version of Dust to Dusk on Steam!<br><br>Game Overview:<br>Set in a modern Japanese office, this horror-inspired adventure title employs the unique Zapping system,<br>which allows you to play the story from the point of view of multiple characters.<br>Although zapping isn't required to reach the game's true ending, it does fill in plenty of gaps and will<br>help you better under each character's motivation.<br><br>There are four different endings, with three &quot;non-true&quot; ending that conclude with a staff roll.<br>Try and find them all!<br><br>Although it is a horror game, there are no chase sequences, no jump scare-type images, or game overs.<br>Play the game and take in the after-office atmosphere at your own pace.<br><br><br>Story:<br>Rumors are abound at the Tsukimiya Corporation about a child ghost<br>that wanders the office halls. In fact, the hushed whispers and paranoia<br>have grown so readily that the office now shuts it doors promptly<br>at seven o'clock each night--the same hour this child comes out to play.<br><br>One night, Jun Tsukimiya, the corporation's chairman, oversleeps at his<br>desk and is left alone on the cusp of dusk. And what does this child say<br>to him when they finally meet?<br><br>&quot;You know nothing, Jun Tsukimiya.&quot;<br><br>Just what is it that he doesn't know? Whatever it is, the clock is stuck<br>at seven, and he has little choice but to find out.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1371770/extras/7320bb5400504f9f52ba336be54cc6a6.avif?t=1744236794\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1371770/extras_big/7320bb5400504f9f52ba336be54cc6a6.avif?t=1744236794 width=800 height=264 /></span>",
