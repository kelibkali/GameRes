    "description": "<i> <strong> Secrets of Egypt </strong> </i> is a casual puzzle game made in 2D graphics.<br>You have three attempts to destroy all the colored balls moving in a curved chain across the screen in the direction of the golden speed-bearer before the balls reach it. You must shoot balls, and chains of balls of the same color (three or more pieces) disappear when a ball of the same color hits them. The colors of the balls to be thrown can be changed for convenience. <i> Good luck with solving the secrets of Egypt! </i>",
