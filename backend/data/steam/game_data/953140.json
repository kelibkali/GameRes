    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Brand new Game Mode</h2>Boss Rush mode contains the classic, intense battles of facing reach boss within Hegis' Grasp one after another. It also contains a new way to enjoy the challenge. While you could buy your supplies to defeat each boss you face, there will also be hidden collectibles in each map for players to find mid-fight.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Exclusive Weapon</h2>Not only will we have actual maps instead of simply battle arenas to provide players more ways to face your foe, but this DLC will include an exclusive weapon - <strong>The <u>Daemon Slasher</u>.</strong><br><br><br><i>The Daemon Slasher is a golden sword that has power embued in it. The energy emitted by Nistello himself has blended with the golden steel and gives a damage boost to all who wield it!</i>",
