    "description": "When the Earth became uninhabitable, an unmanned aerial vessel called the ARC was sent to space bearing human DNA. The ARC's robot steward Buz-B — who has become stir crazy in the eons since leaving Earth — has finally identified a suitable planetary body that may sustain a biosphere for human life to flourish again. The planet is not inhabitable in its current state — but that is where the ARC's real capabilities (and you) come in. <br><br>Buz-B awakens you — the ARC's onboard advanced small craft piloting A.I. — from a suspended state. To bring the planet back to life, you'll need to pilot drone ships equipped with drills and a custom loadout of other tools, sending them forth to excavate ore from asteroids and fend off rival Harvester space stations that are also vying for the bounties of deep space. You and Buz-B must refine alloys from the ore collected to fortify and resurrect a new home planet for those would be born of the DNA that has come so far.<br><br>A &quot;ship shooter&quot; without bullets or weapons, Anisto rethinks the genre with unique tools and scenarios that test decision making, not just reflexes.<br><br>Features<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Destroy asteroids with drills and unique tools to harvest their valuable ore<br></li><li>Craft ore into alloys which power up your ship and its tools<br></li><li>Rebuild a dying planet as a new home for humanity, resurrecting life on the brink of extinction<br></li><li>Defeat the Harvester ships that threaten your burgeoning planet in epic boss fights<br></li><li>Keep track of your lifetime statistics and high scores</li></ul>",
