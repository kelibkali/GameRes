    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Once Upon a Time… in a Hand-Stitched Realm</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Jánoska</strong>, the brave (and slightly naive) youngest son, leaves home seeking honest work—but instead tumbles into a world filled with magic and mischief.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Wander through enchanted forests and sun-kissed hills  that feel like living embroidery. Meet hermits, merchants, and the occasional cunning scoundrel, all painted with folk-art charm. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>The Enchanted Realm of Behind the Beyond</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Your journey begins in a small village, but the path quickly leads you into the extraordinary: deep enchanted woods, the Sky-Tall Tree that bridges worlds, and even the King’s glittering palace—populated by royals, rogues, and everyone in between. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Magic, Choices &amp; a Clever Fox Companion</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Click your way through the story—look, talk, pick stuff up, charm, flex muscle, or slip past danger. Many puzzles offer more than one solution, changing not just outcomes but which paths you unlock further into the game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You will also meet a faithful companion, the <strong>Fox</strong>—sharp-eyed, magically gifted, and far more than a sidekick. Switch to her when stealth, spells, or cunning are key.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Time Waits for No One</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >As time ticks, the day-night cycle influences what paths open, when secrets emerge, and how the world unfolds.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Always Time for a Round of Cards</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Need to win respect or just settle an argument fairly? Challenge locals (even animals!) to <strong>Ulti</strong>, the clever, competitive Hungarian card game.

Check it out!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Tales Shared… by You</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Planning to stream? Flip on <strong>Streamer Mode</strong>.
