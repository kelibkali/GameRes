You can even render out your animation as an image sequence (and an MP4 file soon)!<br><br>If you're not too great at animation, you can still pose objects, characters, add particles and lights, and more, and render out cool stills or backgrounds!<br><br>With Steam Workshop support, you can even add your own content, whether that be weapons, props, characters, or even entire scenes!<br><br>With the addition of Live Recording, Pose Blending, and Collada DAE export, you can even use it as a quick-pose tool for your favorite 3D software!<br><br>Video tutorials: <br>Content Creation tutorial: ",
