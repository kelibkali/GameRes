The game aims to capture the open nature of home cooking, allowing experimentation across 100 different dishes. Players will use beautifully stylized 3D renders of ingredients to create these dishes however they like, offering a fun yet challenging experience. Players will even be able to choose their own plating styles, to make sure the dishes look as pretty and delicious as possible. <br><br>Soup Pot’s kitchen is a welcoming place, whether you’re a seasoned cook or don’t know which end of the whisk to hold. You’re free to experiment and try new things without having to worry about the pressure of failing. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e9759e7a16214544490b1e0/1615891910293-G64XYGEDIUBP16XF85NH/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kJQyhJNCPFaF3z6oMQ5KwFtZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpzhlCaEgGK9R2Fj-RtkyZyFbHKQz_-8cz-_kD00qBQm_sLaI7aC2mtvXSuxlNMVkDA/souppot+%282%29.gif\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Become a master of the kitchen,</strong> cooking more than 100 different mouth-watering recipes that incorporate hundreds of potential ingredients.
