Bugs emerge from the ground, many of which from random locations, at an increasing rate. Which is the greater enemy? The bug horde, or your own nerves?<br><br>To help, once you've earned certain amounts of points, you earn powerful bug bombs, and health-restoring building repair kits- but not even these can fight the bugs off for long!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/738720/extras/8ef5e6a3220908ebc1a92b6c22701423.avif?t=1672693103\" width=500 height=64 /></span><br>Want to team up with a friend?
