    "description": "This is a demo for the game Epocria. The full game takes place within a randomly generated world, however inside this demo you will experience many features Epocria has to offer. Including crafting, building, weapons enemies and boss fights. Taking place inside of a dungeon you must equip yourself with the strongest magical and technological weapons to escape.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEpocria is the result of over a year of development from one man. I have put in countless hours refining the games content and making it an enjoyable experience. This includes a multitude of boss fights, enemies and items. Another important feature to the gameplay is the dimension system and worlds to explore, visit the Underworld, Dig to the deepest caves or even remain in the Overworld. The choice is yours to explore.",
