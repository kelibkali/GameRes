    "description": "Patent9 is a noir sci-fi mystery visual novel set in a neon-lit, rain-soaked deco cityscape. The story follows Lang, a bioengineer plagued by strange visions of unknown origin which drive him to construct a series of artificial life forms dubbed &quot;Patents&quot;, with the goal of creating the ultimate being that could change his life around—for better or worse. However, the dark forces controlling the City have their own plans regarding Lang's enigmatic work, and set out to use their vast resources in furthering their agenda.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJoin in Lang's attempts at resolving the ultimate mystery of the visions as he encounters a series of often intriguing and alluring, but also dangerous characters stalking the shadowy sprawl of the City.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo what extent is one ready to go just to free himself from the darkness of daily existence? What if your path to salvation was based solely on otherworldly visions and seemingly dependent on only one person born out of those dreams? Could you make that leap of fate?",
