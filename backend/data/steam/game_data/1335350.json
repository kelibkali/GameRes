Playing is simple at first: You need to guide the lonely project engineer to the power transformer and avoid angry landowners, various obstacles and weather effects while you do so. You can even &quot;shoot&quot; land use contracts against your enemies and use drills to destroy rocks and other things, making your job even easier. However, things tend to change as you progress... <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1335350/extras/06985fbb2f6203e056484dd95453232d.avif?t=1704200290\" width=600 height=148 /></span><br><br>Get your planning career started right now! Travel through cultured fields with uncultured farmers. Stroll in the relaxing woodlands while avoiding burly lumberjacks. Experience over 35 levels with different terrains and inhabitants (mostly hostile) and meet all kinds of animals ranging from endangered flying squirrels to resurrected dinosaurs. Be always ready to step up though! You may get challenged to compete in various Boss levels every once in a while! After all, you are moving in their territory without a permit ;)<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1335350/extras/9ac647117257012c7f634d3944c34fee.avif?t=1704200290\" width=600 height=64 /></span><br><br>Kaapelipeli: The Cable Game is both fun and educative (Learn Finnish, the 6th most difficult language in the world) and discover how power lines affect the surrounding landscape. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1335350/extras/1c22e651959503ded88e57002ef08eb7.avif?t=1704200290\" width=600 height=148 /></span><br><br>Made with love, coffee and Gamesalad 1.25.",
