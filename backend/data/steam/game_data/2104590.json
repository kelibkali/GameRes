While the core controls let you play mostly passively, the active controls and interactive mechanics like Wall Slams / Corpses have a LOT of advanced tech that you can discover through experimentation.<br><br>If you enjoy technical action games like <strong>Devil May Cry, Nioh 2, or Kingdom Hearts 2</strong> then you will find a lot of familiar ways to create expressive combos that involve multiple systems reacting to each other, where there is no predefined strongest combo or best playstyle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Full Game Will Include:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>More Weapons, each with their own unique mechanical progression and variants.<br></li><li>New things to do during each run, and new challenges to take on. Runs remain short, but give you new ways to approach them.<br></li><li>More enemies, locations, music, and characters<br></li><li>Weather System will be enabled.<br></li><li>More Neural Clusters (The skill trees you customize on level up with sockets and randomized special passives).<br></li><li>More Spellbooks, each with their own Neural Cluster.<br></li><li>And much more in future updates after that!</li></ul><br>This is still a very early demo. The cooking has only just begun, and the final version will be SO much better, with far fewer blindspots in the game design.",
