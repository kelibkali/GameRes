Instead of XP grinding, it introduces a Tainting Mechanics. While traveling through the shattered reality of the Sanctuary, you will receive personality traits based on your choices. These will be the main source of your strength. To harness them, you will have to act accordingly. Becoming an alcoholic means that you will be rewarded for getting drunk, but from that point being sober might prove to be unbearable.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/530930/extras/0044f24e601df57cf7d2ea7890a8a540.poster.avif?t=1765282627\" width=620 height=348 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/530930/extras/0044f24e601df57cf7d2ea7890a8a540.webm?t=1765282627\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/530930/extras/0044f24e601df57cf7d2ea7890a8a540.mp4?t=1765282627\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Main Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> A unique Tainting Mechanic designed to encourage role playing<br></li><li> Tons of weapons, armor, and utility items<br></li><li> Dynamic and tactical combat build around stamina management and distance control<br></li><li> Optional stealth approach that complements fighting<br></li><li> Randomly generated, visually breathtaking levels<br></li><li> High difficulty level emphasized by permadeath mechanics<br></li><li> Gameplay­-driven narrative</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay</h2>Before entering each level of the Sanctuary you get to choose a Taint that represents a certain personality trait. That choice will shape your future experiences as each Taint unlocks a new way of gaining power - a custom mechanic designed to encourage role-playing. Tainting Mechanics channels your will to survive into actions that are aligned with your hero’s personality. Let’s have a look at some examples:<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/530930/extras/d76ff82e7c8c7698371bdc9b35d5c73c.avif?t=1765282627\" width=620 height=620 /></span><br><br>As you go deeper into the Sanctuary you’ll be able to add more Taints to your character’s personality making the shifting levels of the dungeon itself a skill tree of a kind. However with each new Taint you’re a step closer to the point of no return. Are you sure you know where it is?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Idea Behind Soulblight</h2>We look back with nostalgia at our pen and paper RPG memories. Back then, gaining XP and leveling up was only part of the fun. The thing we were most excited about was actual role-playing. For a brief moment becoming a character with all their merits but also with all their flaws. Sometimes their shortcomings would stand in the way of solving a quest at hand making the game more difficult. But because of that the characters felt more alive and that’s why we wouldn’t have it any other way.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/530930/extras/ca24e703e346f40e560587dfba62507c.poster.avif?t=1765282627\" width=620 height=348 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/530930/extras/ca24e703e346f40e560587dfba62507c.webm?t=1765282627\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/530930/extras/ca24e703e346f40e560587dfba62507c.mp4?t=1765282627\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>The situation with video games is different. For the most part players can’t miss an opportunity to get precious loot or XP knowing that the game will penalize them for it. That’s why no one expect players not to fight a giant spider just because their character might have arachnophobia. So if we want players to actually role­play there needs to be a special mechanic that will encourage them to do so. That is how our Tainting Mechanic came to be.",
