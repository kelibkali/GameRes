    "description": "Chair simulator is an exciting single player adventure for PC (Windows and MacOS) that puts the player right into the sitting seat. Featuring hundreds of chairs, multiple endings, and a balance between relaxing chair collection and challenging sitting-posture gameplay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChair Simulator has all your favorite chairs, from Eames, Saarinen, Starcke, Bertoli, Corbusier, Thonet, Emeco, Panton, Jensen, Breuer, Van Der Rohe and more!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuy chairs. Sit down. Accumulate Sit Points through the all-new Sit Point System. Spend your Sit Points on new chairs! The possibilities are endless. But be careful: sitting still for too long can get uncomfortable fast, and this leads to numbness, hemorrhoids, muscle atrophy, and ultimately permadeath. Chair Simulator is the Dark Souls of sitting simulators.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay as one of 14 unique characters, whom you may recognize from real life. Chair Simulator features pro sitters including MrBeast, Dillon Francis, Corinna Kopf, Nadeshot, JustMaiko, Evan Palmblad, Neeko, Muselk, Lazarbeam, Faze Kay, Faze Jarvis, 24kgoldn, Muselk, Cheetles, and Bingo Bob.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChair Simulator takes place over TWO exciting locations: your living room, and a sprawling blue and yellow chair store. Progress through an extensive unlock tree to attain ever more luxurious designer chairs. At the end of the day we all need to sit: chair simulator lets you sit in style.",
