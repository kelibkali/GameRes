    "description": "Impossible Runner is all about running and jumping! The goal of the game is not to complete every level, it's about having fun! The game is impossible after all, unless you can prove me wrong.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnjoy all 10 'Impossible' levels. You can choose these levels in the main menu!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is my first ever game. When I started this project I had no experience making games. I followed a bunch of tutorials and made Impossible Runner! This was a passion project, that's why I'm releasing everything for free. Please do not expect a AAA, flawless experience. Many things might be missing in the game and you'll maybe find a few bugs here and there. Just know that everything was made with love and passion and this won't be my last game!",
