    "description": "Chiasm blends mind-bending time and spatial puzzles with a unique, pensive aesthetic.  Time here is a freeway, if you switch lanes, you will be headed backwards.  Can you master the strangeness of inverted time?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChiasm is a sokaban-style game where time is inverted on half of the level. When you cross over, that side is now going forward, and your previous side is now flowing backwards. Watch your previous self work backwards through your actions. Other objects also have their own frame of reference, adding layers to the puzzles. Over 30 levels challenge your mastery of time.",
