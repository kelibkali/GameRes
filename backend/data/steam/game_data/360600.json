    "description": "<strong>99 Waves to Die</strong> is a twin stick arcade shooter, inspired by the arcade games, and 8-bit home consoles &amp; computers of the 1980's. <br><br>Remember when video games used to be insanely difficult? <br><br>When you used to spend $’s in the local arcade trying to get the high score? <br><br>When having your three letter initials/acronym at the top of the table meant you were the king? <br><br>Well we do, and that is why we have created <strong>99 Waves to Die</strong>. <br><br>A ship, 3 lives, limited smart-bombs and scarce power-ups is all you have to try and survive the waves of enemies that rally against you. <br><br>With voxel based graphics, inspired by 80′s video game classics &amp; excellent 8-bit audio fx, <strong>99 Waves to Die</strong> will take you back to those seedy, dark, smoke filled arcades of your childhood. Re-live the 80′s heyday of the arcade, but without the quarters. <br><br>Can you survive to see Wave 99?",
