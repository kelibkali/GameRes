Each opponent is a creature of Slavic mythology.<br></li><li>Bosses are unique, both gameplay and visual. Among them there are both familiar ones, like Likho or Koshchei, and the iron man present only in Belarusian mythology.<br></li><li>One of the features of opponents is the adaptation mechanics. This is an ability that allows the enemy to react to the player's actions. It is present in half of all bosses, and it is unique for everyone.<br></li><li>The action movie is a cross between Dark Souls 3 and God of War 2018.
