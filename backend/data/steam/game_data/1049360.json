    "description": "Orbitron<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOrbitron is a robot created by man to search the Universe for power orbs as our energy on earth has perished.  It is your duty to control &quot;Orbitron&quot; as he collects all the orbs on the path, and has to avoid being destroyed by DeathBots and DeathBalls that are throughout the course.  Stay on the path, and avoid all obstacles.  Make it to the other side and Rainen will take you to the next level. Use the arrow keys to control Orbitron and the (Shift key) to make him sprint.  This second person controlled 3D game consists of a One Quest Level Objective; along with a bonus credit level at the end.  If Orbitron is killed; he will start from the beginning.  Do your best to stay on the path and collect all of the energy orbs.  Good luck the world is depending on you.",
