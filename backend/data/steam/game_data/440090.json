    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >COMMUNITY-MADE MOD FOR RED ORCHESTRA 2/RISING STORM</h2><br>Heroes of the West is a mod created by the RO2 community which brings the RO2/RS experience to the Western European theater, pitting the US forces against the German Wehrmacht. It also introduces a whole new faction, the British, bringing the 'Tommies' to the RO2 experience. The mod has been developed with support from the developers, Tripwire Interactive. It includes 4 new maps, 5 new character sets and 10 new weapons.<br><br>The initial release of Heroes of the West on Steam will feature 4 maps:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Omaha Beach - The US 29th Infantry Division storm the bloody beaches of Normandy during the 'Longest Day', June 6th 1944, battling against well dug-in Wehrmacht troops of the 352.
