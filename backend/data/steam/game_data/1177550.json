Smash those pumpkins and defeat the spooky bosses to collect as much candy as you can!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDestroy the incoming waves of pumpkins and other horrors by aiming and firing the magical candle on them. Do not let any of them reach the village!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis casual arcade game features 10 stages with a boss fight at the end of each stage. The stages contain various waves of wicked pumpkins and other unimaginable creatures with pickup-able power ups and - of course - additional candies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHave fun and kill some time!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRumly",
