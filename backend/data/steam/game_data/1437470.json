You play as the titular Rodent, a small rat that gains incredible power when he unwittingly comes into contact with a sentient piece of cosmic driftwood. Not long after this chance meeting Rodent finds himself up against the mysterious Knights of the Round. Who are they? And what could they possibly want with Plank?<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1437470/extras/3f5e3ee967674f1cf32c3a154f168070.poster.avif?t=1762646189\" width=360 height=202 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1437470/extras/3f5e3ee967674f1cf32c3a154f168070.webm?t=1762646189\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1437470/extras/3f5e3ee967674f1cf32c3a154f168070.mp4?t=1762646189\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1437470/extras/5fea365e803f6b938a85afee76928229.webp?t=1762646189\" width=200 height=40 /></span>              <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1437470/extras/4736ab0b052831ea18b59ac2bd3a4256.poster.avif?t=1762646189\" width=300 height=40 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1437470/extras/4736ab0b052831ea18b59ac2bd3a4256.webm?t=1762646189\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>Players can choose from one of four starting weapon types.
