As soon as <strong>Amnesia</strong> franchise started to pick up we saw an opportunity for a new mix. The general conception is that as soon as you have weapons to fight with, the horror part of the game fades away. We believe this is incorrect and <strong>Blinding Dark</strong> is our attempt to prove otherwise. Scarce ammunition, powerful enemies and limited options to recover health, creates a lot of tension and fear of death. Pair this up with the fact that there is a serious repercussion when dying and you have the danger / tension element back in the game.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/319390/extras/5599661d8d9468c94e6c267e91beee43.avif?t=1447363287\" width=350 height=78 /></span><br><br>You wake up in an entrance hall of, what seems to be, a mansion.
