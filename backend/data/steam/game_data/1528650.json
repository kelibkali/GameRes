He and his family are known martial artists, but his father is a deadbeat; a gambling drunkard constantly getting into fights. Meanwhile, he refuses to work, claiming it to be part of his training.

At first, he planned to cook it, but Suzuka vetoes the idea. Instead, he names it &quot;Haru&quot; and keeps it as a pet. As he grows fonder of Haru, dragonkin suddenly invade from space! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The dragons are about to take over earth, but Haru suddenly transforms from a lizard into a beautiful lady and persuades them!
