The Sacred Grove now lies empty.  You answer their call for help - your quest; to find and restore the crystals before the next storm arrives.  It soon becomes clear however, that all is not quite as simple as it first seems.<br><br>RuneSage is an immersive open world Virtual Reality RPG Adventure game for the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift &amp; Touch.  As a sage from humble beginnings, you'll search the land for nature's runes of power, then use them to cast spells to solve puzzles that aid you on your quest.  Explore mazes in a forest teaming with wildlife, sail across lakes to reach distant shores, delve into dark and ancient caves, and search the ruined castle and its dungeons while menacing vultures circle overhead. Can you find the scrolls of knowledge, recover the lost crystals and protect the world from the gathering storm?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/542030/extras/7047da60bc77c1f52337c65313317a08.webp?t=1572558274\" width=616 height=60 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Experience 10-15 hours of immersive adventuring in one of VR's longest games.<br></li><li>Interact with NPCs in an engaging story with over 40 quests to find the missing crystals.<br></li><li>Cast over 35 unique spells to help solve a wide variety of puzzles to complete the shield.<br></li><li>Explore 20 stunning biomes with over 80 items to find and collect.<br></li><li>Become the wisest of the magic users and save the world.</li></ul><br>Please note that RuneSage is <u><strong>not</strong></u> (yet another) fast paced generic action VR wave shooter.  There are no monsters to kill.  You are never &quot;in danger&quot;.  RuneSage is deliberately a more gentle experience; a magical &quot;scavenger hunt&quot; designed for those wanting to explore an immersive open world, discovering its secrets at their own pace.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/542030/extras/3ad6481d04f5591c429ea305f3f7e627.webp?t=1572558274\" width=616 height=60 /></span><br><br>At the heart of RuneSage are runes and spells.    <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Runes echo the forces of nature; wind, water, fire etc and you'll discover their forms as you explore the world.<br></li><li>Spells channel the power of the runes into physical form - for example, draw the shape of a wind rune, then cast it to create a blast of air.  <br></li><li>The power of runes can also be combined - for example, draw a wind rune followed by a water rune, then cast it to blow water in a powerful jet.</li></ul><br>Use your knowledge and wisdom of the natural world to investigate your surroundings, discovering new combinations of runes to solve puzzles to aid you on your quest to find the missing crystals and save the world.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/542030/extras/76cd728bf46bc6754fca5916675c9c3a.webp?t=1572558274\" width=616 height=60 /></span><br><br>RuneSage is designed from the ground up for Virtual Reality with full support for both the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift &amp; Oculus Touch.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Movement.

To climb up / over objects, press down the trackpad/thumbstick controller to teleport.</li></ul><br></li><li>Rotation.
