A very robust tropical wood was used in construction of the ship. San Pedro Apóstol was laid down in 1747 and launched in 1749 alongside her sister ship Fenix. In her early years, the ship was used to carry particularly important passengers from the European royal families. In the beginning of the nineteenth century San Pedro Apóstol was sent to Cartagena Shipyard for complete refitting and later participated in the battle of Trafalgar.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>About premium consumable vessels.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Premium ships cannot be captured by players or traded.
