Cursed Treasure 2 is an addictive tower-defense game that puts the power of darkness at your fingertips. As a creature of ultimate evil, you don't ask for much... just to raze the odd kingdom and have your cache of all-powerful magical gems safely hidden away. Too bad the (ugh) good guys are out to steal them. Using the powers of the orcs, demons, and undead, you'll build unique and powerful towers along paths to destroy any hero that dares get close.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1478890/extras/ct2example.png?t=1650960076\" /></span><br><br>Upgrade your undead crypts to instill fear in foes that make them flee in the opposite direction, or turn your demonic temples into mighty icons capable of turning the ground to lava beneath anyone's feet.
