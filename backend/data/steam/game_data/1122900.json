    "description": "Defend Sine Wave City from the evil WaveLord. Control the phase and frequency of your sine wave shield to match the incoming lasers, and save your city!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSine Wave City is an arcade game in the style of space invaders, where the player controls a sine wave to stop incoming lasers. The sine wave is only effective at the peaks of the wave, so the player must shift phase and frequency to stop all incoming attacks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSine wave city is only playable with a gamepad. The left knob controls phase, and the right knob controls frequency. Each new level brings new challenges and varying laser patterns, but the sinewave shield gains new abilities to defend against the new threats. Try for a perfect score, and don't let any lasers hit the city!",
