    "description": "From The Grave is a zombie Survival game where you are placed in a medieval dungeon to fight endless hordes of zombies. This game includes a fully voiced main protagonist, a fully made custom map to explore, and a set of 6 different unique weapons to fight the undead. This creepy atmosphere adventure will feel like a throwback to old zombie games where it's just you, a pistol, and a horde of zombies trying to kill you.",
