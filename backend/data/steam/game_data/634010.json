    "description": "When the Aqua-Fu calls, you answer. Nowadays the Aqua-Fu also tends to send a text message when it can't reach you by phone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen Dizzy got the text she set off on a pilgrimage to the Aqua-Fu home nebula: the Waxxon spiral. There, she met with Noodle Smiggs, a man with a terrible name but mythical Aqua-Fu skills. She spent three gruelling years in training, lifting rocks with nothing but the drops of sweat on her forehead, washing dishes while manipulating the flow of water from across the room, and cleaning spaceships down in the spaceport for some extra cash.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter years of training, Dizzy was introduced to the secrets of the Scrolls of Xi-Pang and her training entered it's final stages. The scrolls had given her untold insight into how Aqua-Fu Masters were all that stood between hidden, unspeakable horrors and the people of the galaxy, and the role she was set to play in events yet to unfold. She had become Kunoichi Dizzy, Master of the Aqua-Fu.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis DLC contains a custom skin for Dizzy in Awesomenauts. You need to have Dizzy available as a playable character in order to access the skin in-game. Owning this skin will also unlock the special portrait for use in-game. This skin contains a fully customized voice set.",
