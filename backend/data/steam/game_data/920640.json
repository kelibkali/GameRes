    "description": "A fast-paced, first-person experience set in a future taken over by deadly hi-tech drones. As humanity's only hope, it's your mission to identify this threat's origin and neutralize it. But are you ready to face an army whose single target is yourself? <br><br>&quot;Hi guys, I'm Mickael Morgado creator of Emitters, it's my first game I'm developing as hobby indie game which consists of a first-person shooter sci-fi survival drone invasions game with some Starwars, aliens or Matrix style. In this game, you have to find and collect stones/batteries to power-up the level. It has multiple weapons, guns, enemies or friendly actors like drones/androids/turrets/airstrike support and bosses, all programmed with the AI system of unrealengine4, go-ahead to test the demo and don't forget to follow my other social networks to keep up to date about new updates or features.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/920640/extras/042ef31b45a114fd4c50818f4ab80597.avif?t=1703011138\" width=616 height=260 /></span>",
