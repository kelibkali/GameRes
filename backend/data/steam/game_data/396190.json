Join Bernard the monk as he makes his way through the hostile reaches of the kingdom on a quest to recover the sacred instruments that hold the world's music together.<br><br>This XL edition is a partially remade version of the original game from 2011, adapting the game for widescreen as well as improving a host of things that were missing the first time around. This free version lets you play up until the second boss.<br><br>The full game features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Nearly 300 individual challenges, enough to last more than your lifetime (if you're a medium-sized insect)<br></li><li> Steam Achievements - some of which aren't patronizing and useless!<br></li><li> Absolutely no water or ice levels!<br></li><li> The Synthesizer, which lets you create magic artefacts to help you on your quest with mere hours of grinding for items!<br></li><li> Use the Music Castle's free wifi to post your scorecard online and laugh at your lesser friends!<br></li><li> The engine behind Five Nights at Freddy's doing something that isn't lastingly traumatic!<br></li><li> Programmer art galore!</li></ul>",
