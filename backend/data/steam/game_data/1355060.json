You may also be able to recover the old and damaged components, repair and repurpose them!<br>After you set up cash registers and other basic tools you will be able to conduct your first transactions. Invest your profit in better equipment, seasonal decorations and additional amenities, but be sure to leave some savings for a rainy day!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Select products and employees</h2>Equally important is the choice of your inventory. Each product has its price, minimum order quantity and availability. You won't be able to buy and sell all of the items from the beginning. Some will require your business to grow to a given size or meet other requirements of the supplier.<br>Obviously you cannot manage the store all by yourself!. Supermarket Manager will allow you to recruit and fire employees, expand their knowledge and skills. Some of them may possess or develop hidden talents that when used correctly will give you the edge over your competition!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Balance income and expenses</h2>Running a business of this size requires always keeping an eye on your finances. A special menu will allow you to control revenues and expenses and create visualisations and charts that will help you keep track of the shifts in the market . Detailed information on the amount of products sold, taxes, maintenance and transport costs will also be available for those who want to feel as a true store manager.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Repair and improve the store</h2>Wear and tear of venues and equipment is inevitable but to maintain the value of your brand you will need to keep your stores in perfect order. Replace outdated elements with new, more efficient ones. Buy, clean, repair or remove appliances and furniture and fill them with your best products. In the worst case scenario, close down the market temporarily and conduct a major renovation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gain new customers and increase your sales</h2>Good marketing department is the cornerstone of your business. Decide on your marketing strategy, choose you target customers and advertise through various means. Change your marketing budget depending on the season, location of your store and other factors. Plan ahead and ensure a steady stream of customers coming through your doors!<br><br>In the end, only time will tell whether you can save your business from bankruptcy and develop a successful, lasting supermarket brand.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1355060/extras/dd9124abe6bf6bd35dcf2aaae8e252b0.poster.avif?t=1743684043\" width=736 height=60 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1355060/extras/dd9124abe6bf6bd35dcf2aaae8e252b0.webm?t=1743684043\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1355060/extras/dd9124abe6bf6bd35dcf2aaae8e252b0.mp4?t=1743684043\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
