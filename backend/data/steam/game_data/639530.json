    "description": "This pack contains the following items:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Firebird<br></li><li>Wasp<br></li><li>Firebird Steel<br></li><li>Inferno Paint</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/639530/extras/1_GIF.PNG?t=1570494448\" /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Firebird</h2>The Firebird is the key to urban warfare. It proved its effectiveness when Antaeus subdued the islands and metropolitan areas of the Pacific. This turret knows its stuff: set fire to your enemy's tank, and then move on. The burning napalm will devour enemy equipment without need for any outside support. Heavy tanks will have no chance. Does it seem like the weapon is taking too long to recharge? You can still shoot burning napalm at the enemy even from half-filled fuel tanks.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Wasp</h2>This hull was specifically designed to cater to the needs of private armies around the world. The Wasp makes short work of old-style tanks, and it is also a valuable tool to fighting modern wars. It can quickly cover distances, and it is easily able to escape enemy fire. It is designed to intercept and engage a cornered enemy in a Blitzkrieg-style battle. This hull poorly resists blows and can even flip over when hit by heavy shells. But it will faithfully serve those that can avoid enemy fire.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Steel Skins</h2>The unofficial skins have gained popularity and because of the value drop of the gold, the mercenaries have started to demand higher quality. This is how Steel was born — a new equipment modification tier.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Note!</h2> You can purchase only 1 Pack per 1 Tanki X account. Refund is not available if you purchase 2 different packs, which include the same weapons, hulls, and skins or you already have the items from the pack! The items will be granted to the account that you use to log into the game through Steam.",
