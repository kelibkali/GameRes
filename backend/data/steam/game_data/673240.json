He’ll need to repair objects, unlock doors, and fix generators and radios to communicate with the “outside world”. Hunted by the mysterious creature in the woods, Daniel isn’t armed, so he must use his wits to escape and hide from dangerous situations as he makes his way to safety. The objects in the game are spawned randomly in the map with each play-through, providing a unique experience each time.   <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>UNARMED: During the gameplay, you’ll have to be stealthy and hide, in order to avoid the dangers or, in extreme cases, run as fast as can.
