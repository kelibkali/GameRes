Wizz created Spellic for a game jam in 2015, but sadly he quit and the development of the original Spellic stopped. I worked with Wizz together on Spellic, and after years of grief I created a new version on my own too keep this awesome game rocking.<strong> I hope someday you find this Wizz</strong>. I miss you, <i>old friend.</i>",
