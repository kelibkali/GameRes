    "description": "Asteroid Deflector is an indie game based on simple physics. You have to prevent asteroids from hitting a planet by changing their trajectory with various projectiles (shells, laser beams, atomics...) while working with - or against - the gravity of the planet and the sun of this solar system. Whilde doing that, you have to take care of weapon research, the planets economy and population.<br><br>This is my first game done in spare time. Expect some hours of fun and a good laugh at the goofy story. There is also an endless game mode to hunt for high scores. Please don't expect a refined, multimillion dollar blockbuster game. I'm always open to suggestions and improvements.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br>- Career mode with 12 levels.<br>- Endless mode.<br>- 23 technologies for research, including four distinctive weapons and a mighty planetary force field.<br>- Manage money, infrastructure, population and keep the people motivated.<br>- Seven (YouTube friendly) spherical songs will help you get in the flow of deflecting asteroids.<br>- Atmospheric sound effects.<br>- Special endgame in story mode (maybe there is more to the asteroids...).<br><br><strong>Gameplay</strong><br>- Simple physics-based fun.<br>- Don't destroy the asteroids (lame), deflect them!<br>- Asteroids burning up in the star generate money (because... why not?).<br>- Expensive research will improve your weapons.<br>- Impacts on the planet will decimate the population and their moral (may result in losing the game).<br>- After a first learning curve, the gameplay can get quite hypnotic or meditative.<br>- Unlimited continues in career mode, saves are done after each level.<br>- It's all about gravity, mass and kinetic energy - but in a fun way!<br><br><strong>FAQ</strong><br>* Are there costly ingame purchases or will there be expensive DLC?<br>- No ingame purchases, it's the full game. <br>* Is this a mobile port?<br>- No, but I may port it to mobile (and remove some features in the base version with the &quot;XL&quot; in the name, in case you were wondering).<br>* A space cannon would never work!!!<br>- First of all - it's just a game. And you may be up for a surprise, if you do some research on &quot;Project HARP&quot;. Also keep in mind: the mass of planets differs a lot and so do escape velocities.",
