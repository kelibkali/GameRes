    "description": "Kira is a FREE mini-experience that immerses users in a Faerie workshop full of mysterious structures, magical devices, and colorful beasts. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis experience is designed to highlight the immersive qualities of VR for friends and family, allowing them to explore each nook and cranny of a fantasy scene. Kira was originally designed as a way-point navigation experiment and so the only interaction is moving from place to place in the environment. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIts a simple experience and not intended to be experienced as a 'game' but it's a project that we really liked so we wanted to share.",
