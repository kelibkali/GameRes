The goal was to take the most beloved characters and competitive elements of franchise platform fighting games and distribute them for free on PC so anyone, anywhere could enjoy them online. <br><br>Fans of platform fighting games will feel right at home with elements of Icons: Combat Arena's roster with a space animal, sword fighter, rushdown brawler and grappler.

However, you may want to consider trying the game out for yourself for the following reasons:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Community</strong> - The friendly, passionate and welcoming Icons Community is now global. Our Discord would love for you to join them: <br></li><li><strong>Fun</strong> - Experiment with a lighthearted twist on a familiar game design with a roster of fan-favorite archtypes and a handful of characters<br></li><li><strong>Support a new platform fighting game</strong> - Icons: Legacy Edition was made possible after a former teammember purchased the company out of its going-out-of-business sale. They plan to effectively continue development on Icons but under a new name and vision. You can read more about them below.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About Vortex &amp; Their Target First Impression for the New Game</h2><br>Vortex, led by a former Wavedash co-founder, is effectively continuing development on Icons: Combat Area, but under a new name, Vortex Rising.<br><br>We want Vortex Rising to look and feel like it offers something new to players:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Collaborative and Competitive Core.</strong> Our online play will feature cooperative team-based gameplay. What does a 2v2 or 3v3 fighting game look like? Is it pure chaos or can it be tamed into something much more competitive? We hope to answer these questions with Vortex Rising.<br></li><li><strong>Unique Gameplay.</strong> Our default gameplay includes beloved elements from other fighting games for the first time into a platform fighting game. We are experimenting with several risky but original ideas to push these concepts even further.<br></li><li><strong>A Perception of Being Easier to Learn.</strong> Tutorials, controls and core gameplay will vary in new and unique game modes to help beginners and button mashers graduate to advanced levels of competitive play.
