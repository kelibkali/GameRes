Then, both players spawn on their map and battle each other in Arena-style combat. Pick your weapon, line up your shots, use rockets to destroy a wall, or dash around a corner to gain the advantage and eliminate your opponents.<br><br><strong>Disclaimer</strong><br>This game is an Indie game, and it is my first published game. Since it is free for everyone, the server isn't the greatest, and you may notice a little more lag than most games. The game is also only playable in online mode, so there must be a player queuing at the same time as you to enter a match. If nobody is currently online, try getting a friend to play the game with you! It's free, and it only takes a few seconds to download.<br>You can join the official Discord server and look for people to play with here: <br>Follow the YouTube channel to see any big updates: ",
