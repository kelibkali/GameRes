    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >  D&amp;D Classics: MC10 Monstrous Compendium Ravenloft Appendix (2E)</h2>They lurk in the shadows. They linger in your dreams. They strike from the darkness. They are foul and horrible creatures that dwell in the dark dimension of Ravenloft and they are waiting for you. Inside this book are elven vampires, the dreaded Dark Ones who have broken the trust of Vistani, and dozens of other creatures sure to add a taste of fear into every Ravenloft campaign. But be warned, those who enter the Mists of Ravenloft are seldom heard from again...<br><i>  We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today. Some older content may reflect ethnic, racial, and gender prejudice that were commonplace in American society at that time. These depictions were wrong then and are wrong today. This content is presented as it was originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed. Dungeons &amp; Dragons teaches that diversity is a strength, and we strive to make our D&amp;D products as welcoming and inclusive as possible.
