Domestic Defense is a unique horror game in which you must use wit, reflex, and audio cues to try to defeat your adversary. In addition, you can monitor your house through selectively placed security cameras and other devices, and this will enabled you to better locate your enemies.<br><br>GAMEPLAY<br>_______<br><br>An intruder has broken into your home with the stated goal of murdering your girlfriend. Your girlfriend arrives at 4:00. Until then, you must locate the intruder within your home to try to shoot him. This is tricky, because he is always on the move and will attempt to avoid or attack you when you near him. In addition, you must also contend with other family members who will pose major distractions. Domestic Defense provides you with an inventory system to aid with your goal. Items include security cameras which you can use to monitor parts of your household, and drinks to give you energy. When the time reaches 4:00 and you have not eliminated the threat, then you must protect your girlfriend from the intruder until one of them has been vanquished.
