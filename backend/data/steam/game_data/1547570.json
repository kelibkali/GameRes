    "description": "The new Krachware User Interface Pop Fantasy pack from Gee Kun Soft offers creators hundreds of options when it comes to freshening out their next game’s UI. With a multitude of options for makers to fancy up their display, they will get to select from designs in a color palette that includes a blue, red, grey, and black color.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Krachware User Interface Material Pop Fantasy pack provides the necessary tools including various options from buttons for controls, now loading screens for transitions, and game over screens for when things didn’t go so well. But let’s restart! This pack also contains nearly 100 borders to jazz up a display with both widescreen and fullscreen sizes for those who want something more current or are going for a total retro kick. Although, perhaps your game will use both widescreen and fullscreen borders to tell a present day story that also references the past.
