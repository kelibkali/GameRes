That is to say, she has killed someone. The victim being missing will lead the young girl into dark and interesting decisions whether at her school or in her everyday life, especially with police and the detective hired by the victim's family.<br>You play as Korokuro, or more precisely, her conscience. In order to choose your own path you can, for example, either help Kurokuro get away with her vicious crimes, help the police and reveal everything you've done, or to simply try to get into some funny and awkward situations: THE CHOICE LIES WITH YOU. Have fun and good luck trying to pull off this <strong>Perfect Murder</strong>.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1143310/extras/8632b64347a151309a2cc4794fdd559a.avif?t=1600881311\" width=450 height=70 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Multiple routes, different endings</li><li>Replayability</li><li>4 to 6 hours of gameplay</li><li>Minigames to hide/discover things</li><li>Steam Achievements</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1143310/extras/06bf3cd3c65d8a88065465bb736c501d.avif?t=1600881311\" width=450 height=70 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1143310/extras/7f07dd73d5492cb76e08313f4ca0bf6f.avif?t=1600881311\" width=275 height=446 /></span><br>You play Korokuro, a 17-year-old sophomore Japanese student, who isn't like any other girl around her.
