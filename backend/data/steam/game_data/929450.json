Are you ready to dive in the 3D-fight in the comfort of your home?<br><br>It's time to fight in a ruthless battle and defend your territory. The walls of the castle are strong, but there are too many enemies. Your main task is to save the crystals in the citadel and withstand the onslaught of invaders arriving simultaneously from 3 portals.<br><br>Each level of complexity needs its own strategy. Think over tactics, choose your weapon and use different types of strikes, starting from single ones - a sword, a hammer, an ax, a crossbow to massive ones - a bomb or a castle cannon. To withstand the chain of attacks look for the different types of weapons on the battlefield and cause even greater damage to your enemies. <br><br>If the enemy has advantage, teleport to the castle and help your folks with long-range weapons. The attack can be strengthened with cannon volleys or with the help of a freeze spell by clicking on the Magic Book on the balcony of the castle.<br><br>Crystals are a non-renewable citadel resource. Protect them carefully from destruction and enemy's attacks. By approaching the crystal, you can reload your crossbow.
