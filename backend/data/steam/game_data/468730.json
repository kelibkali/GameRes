Only one thing stands in your way: None of you have the faintest clue what any of your spells actually do.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><br>•\tTrial by fire, experiment to find out what you can do. Try to work out how to use your power before you’re destroyed by the consequences of using it carelessly.<br>•\tMillions of possible spellbook layouts, different powers every game.<br>•\tFace over a dozen threats including imps, fires, floods, haunting and demons.<br>•\tThreats that combat each other. Don’t have a spell to put out that fire? Just open a hole to the water dimension instead!<br>•\tColourful characters. Each associated with a collection of spells that have different effects when cast by them.<br>•\tFair play mechanics. Disasters are drawn a round in advance to give you time to prepare rather than being blindsided by the RNG.<br>•\tScenarios change the objective of the game and add unique rules.
