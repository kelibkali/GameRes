To grow your farm you'll need to catch eggs from the chickens, work at the market to gain income, sell your fatter chickens for a tidy profit and cash in on the egg catching combo meter.<br><br>The further you progress the more fun the game becomes, with chickens gaining cool abilities allowing differing income strategies and interesting ways to play.",
