    "description": "<strong>Beating A Dead Horse With A One-Trick Pony</strong> is a first-person RPG (ArtPG) with a narrative, mild melee combat, and some platforming elements. The game is a sequel to, <strong>Jeff Koons Must Die!!!</strong>, and is set in the same destroyed museum that the previous game ended in.

You will enlist the help of some old friends to help along the way and, hopefully, uncover your own path.<br><br>Some Level Themes:<br><br>Aftermath: Revel in the destruction of days past. Contemplate your actions or inaction.<br><br>The Church of Kitsch: Escape the confines of a rigid structure. Visit the church and pay respects. <br><br>Art and Commerce: Visit the opportunity hub in order to generate some currency, attend the learning annex, and apply to exhibit at Art Basil Minneapolis. Keep an eye on your relevance though, you will need it.<br><br>Art and Celebrity: Visit a mystical land where you will learn how to become an art star. Create your own personal mythology and acquire currency from collectors. Be careful though, you might lose yourself.<br><br>Redemption: Re-visit the past and connect with your roots. Excavate. <br><br>The Road Home: Escape the final structure and light four beacons in order to finish the game. <br><br>Easter Eggs:<br>There are multiple easter eggs and hidden areas in the game.

If you quit the game in the middle of a level you will need to start over when you reload it (other than the last level).<br><br>Note from the dev:<br>This game was created over a year from November 2017 through November 2018. It was a very personal project that deals with my struggles navigating the pitfalls of the art world and my realizations and epiphanies regarding the complex systems within that world. It is a love letter as well as a Dear John letter.",
