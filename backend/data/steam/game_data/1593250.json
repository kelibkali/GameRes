    "description": "This is a funny kinetic visual novel with minigames where an insurance agent named Jim is sneaking out of the office to meet a girl his dating app matched for him. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe text is filled with office humor and mature jokes about dating and the absurdity of life. The minigames are not too hard, and you can skip them if you like. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story has 5 chapters written so far. In this Early Access version we publish only the 1st chapter where Jim is finding his way out of the office building. If you like the game, please let us know in the comments. Before going on with implementation of the rest of the chapters we'd happy to get some feedback. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanks!",
