    "description": "XENOCAVE is a retro-styled, scrolling platformer that elevates the genre with a unique fusion of ability and fine-tuned mechanics inspired by the classics. Specifically, imagine an amalgam of Mario's fluid controls, the double-jump and rapid-fire of Ghosts 'n Goblins, and the themes of Crystal Caves.<br><br><strong>You spot a cave entrance in the distance.<br><br>Setting your ship down on an alien planet, you grab your pickaxe and blaster with a gleam in your eye. What nefarious obstacles and challenging foes will stand before you and the mountains of treasure you know are hidden within?<br><br>Step forward, fire up your jetpack and enter, the XENOCAVE.</strong><br><br>That's right -- there's no princess or world to save, no clichéd plot. As an explorer and archaeologist, curiosity and the will to overcome great odds are all the motivation you need!",
