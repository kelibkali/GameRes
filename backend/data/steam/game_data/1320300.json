    "description": "<i>The Cubedex of Brass and Wood</i> is a puzzle game consisting of five mysterious electromechanical devices linked by the Cubedex itself. Like puzzle hunts and escape rooms, sometimes the goal is obvious but the solution is challenging; and sometimes figuring out the goal is itself part of the puzzle.<br><br>The demo contains special versions of two of the puzzles, connected by a (not-in-the-full-game) meta-puzzle.",
