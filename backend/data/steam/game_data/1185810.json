    "description": "<strong>Cyborg Mechanic</strong> is a simulation game where you face challenges as surgeon / mechanic working on cyborgs, bionic people and augmented humans. You will diagnose, repair and improve your customers’ bodies, as well as develop you workshop and acquire new equipment. You will operate in the underground, gaining fame and money – but also avoiding cyber-raids by the authorities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Augment your clients</h2>Your job is to make your customers happy by solving their problems. It's your way to fame and money. And of course it's all you live for. Your task, as a cyber mechanic, is not only to diagnose problems, but also to introduce modifications and improvements to bodies, minds and shells. But be careful as any procedure can end in your client suffering pain, disability, death or something even worse...<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1185810/extras/f862d6ddee6453529822dabbf5173e45.poster.avif?t=1726140631\" width=640 height=360 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1185810/extras/f862d6ddee6453529822dabbf5173e45.webm?t=1726140631\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1185810/extras/f862d6ddee6453529822dabbf5173e45.mp4?t=1726140631\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Assignments</h2>Your clients works in the underground world – they are traffickers, bodyguards, soldiers, madmen addicted to implanting new cyberware, street samurais, mnemonics and more. Many of them have interesting stories to tell, but all of them want repairs or improvements. Job orders vary in their level of complexity and the equipment requires to complete the task. You don't have to accept every client, but implanting augmentations is your way of life...<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1185810/extras/063825c3ffc7eafc84b05e2c5b384099.poster.avif?t=1726140631\" width=640 height=360 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1185810/extras/063825c3ffc7eafc84b05e2c5b384099.webm?t=1726140631\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1185810/extras/063825c3ffc7eafc84b05e2c5b384099.mp4?t=1726140631\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Augmentations</h2>How’bout a russian mechanical arm from a decade ago. Maybe some wolverine-like claws of your own design. The most modern laser eyes are on offer. You also have high-end coprocessors. The list of implants requiring simple or very complex procedures increases with your skills, fame and resources. Over time, your clients' bodies, minds and shells won’t have any secrets for you...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Workshop management</h2>Money is just a way to achieve your goal which is to create the best workshop in the city. What equipment will help you find more customers? Do you need to purchase a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) right now or is it better to invest in a state of the art amputation saw first? Laser soldering iron or surgical scalpel – tough choice? Posters, colourful LEDs or slot machines? Cause looks are also important!<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1185810/extras/12f2f5fccbcb3737617c29c0dcc7704f.poster.avif?t=1726140631\" width=640 height=360 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1185810/extras/12f2f5fccbcb3737617c29c0dcc7704f.webm?t=1726140631\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1185810/extras/12f2f5fccbcb3737617c29c0dcc7704f.mp4?t=1726140631\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Cyberpolice</h2>You work as an outlaw - without any license, out of control and not worrying too much about a sterile environment in your workshop. The more famous you are, the more illegal implants branded by you appear on the streets, the more vigilant the cyber police will be. Be sure they will be looking for you. Maybe they'll lock you up right away? Maybe you can bribe them? Or maybe they will ask you for a small favour, who knows!",
