    "description": "<strong>WordMaster</strong> is a simple word making game. A round lasts 1 minute with 7 randomly selected letters (with at least a single vowel among them). You score points by creating long words or by using letters that are used less frequently in English. You may repeat letters within a word. The trailer shows exactly what the game is and takes you through a full round, post game, and leaderboard update. <br><br>For example:<br><br>Suppose our round letters are W I N E R S L. We could spell wines, winners, sewers, sinners etc. <br><br>Here is a breakdown of the scoring:<br>Letter points:<br>AEIOULNSTR = 1 pt<br>DG = 2 pts<br>BCMP = 3 pts<br>FHVWY = 4 pts<br>K = 5 pts<br>JX = 8 pts<br>QZ = 10 pts<br><br>Word length:<br>3 letters = 1 pt<br>4 letters = 2 pts<br>5 letters = 3 pts<br>6 letters = 5 pts<br>7 letters = 8 pts<br>8 or more letters = 10 pts<br><br>This is my first attempt at coding. I'm a teacher and wanted something my students could play that would be somewhat educational.",
