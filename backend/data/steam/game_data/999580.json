    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Meanders Map Pack: Undervaults and Dragon Lairs</h2>Featuring 24 new terrains from creatures high above to underground labyrinths far below, dungeons and catacombs take as many varied forms as the lairs of the many dragons. Pose them as individual challenges or lead players through them to the lairs via a large assortment of differently themed catacombs, prisons, dungeons, a castle and various sections of the Undervaults. From crystalline nightmarescapes that look out into another dimension to hazardous meanders through elemental labyrinths of fire, ice, spiders, slime and stone - this pack offers a huge assortment of dangerous dungeons to get lost in. Lead your players into the gold hoards of the great wyrms in the core four jungle, ice, forest and desert terrains with dragon occupation including touches of dragon eggs, dragmarks, and bloody mountains of skulls and carcasses from feasts past where your adventurers will need to overcome not just the large beasts you deem to inhabit here, but the challenges of the terrains themselves to claim the rich heaps of glittering gold. Bubbling swampy mud, frozen climes, close quarters, the advantage of foes elevation and hints of one or two smaller but no less dangerous wyrms somewhere on the loose...<br><i>Featuring 24 ready-to-go maps:</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Four Dragon Lairs<br></li><li>Four Castle Dungeons<br></li><li>Three Ice Dungeons<br></li><li>An Ice Castle<br></li><li>Ice Caverns<br></li><li>Four Fire Dungeons<br></li><li>Five Underdark Undervaults<br></li><li>2 Drow-Themed Maps</li></ul>Maps are sized specially for FG at 1350x900 and under 500 kb each to help prevent slow-down during play.
