Each day the captain picks the crew they trust to play in, and those pirates can either obey the captain if they be trustworthy, or disobey if they’re looking to cause some trouble. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >At the end of each day, the crew vote to throw a pirate overboard. Throwing over a ghost is good news for the crew, as the ghost leaves the ship and the humans can celebrate! But woe betide the crew who throw over an innocent human, as the spirit of the drowned will haunt one of the pirates who accused them, turning them into another ghost…</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Nobody’s voyage is ever over because they were thrown overboard in Paper Pirates though, and after being voted off you come back on board as the ship’s new stowaway! You can’t win the game if you stay as stowaway, but if you can convince the crew to throw someone else overboard, well...  you’re sure to rank up and earn that promotion.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234220/extras/80725d0c4b3c25303f9932c3db1b7945.avif?t=1770463110\" width=600 height=166 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Start out with a Classic game for some original Paper Pirates ghost hunting action, then try a Scored game to give each pirate a secret objective, earning coins to show who can be the toughest, meanest pirate on the seven seas.
