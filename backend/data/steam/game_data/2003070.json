    "description": "Here you have full game, please wishlists if you like our game:<br><br><br>In the free Orc Warchief prologue, you'll be able to manage your Orc Village. Collect resources, expand your city and pursue politics. You have to keep order because orcs like to be naughty. Gameplay will be limited to a few quests compared to the full game.<br><br>Many years have passed since the Great War and defeat that the Orcs suffered from vile humans. From that time they hunted us like animals and pressed deeper into our lands. But you decided not to back down one step further. You’re a young Warchief lusting for blood and your warriors want revenge. Reclaim your lands, rebuild your villages and bring doom on our enemies. Raise our warbanner and gather The Horde. We will follow you to death or victory! Lead our Warchief!<br><br>Rebuild your destroyed villages and gather resources you need. Hunt for game and prepare supplies for your army. Train your warriors and prepare your weapons. Build your war machines and defences. And bring the revenge your people deserve.<br><br>In this strategic city builder your goal is to rebuild the might of The Horde. You need to gather necessary resources to build your buildings and expand your village. Gather food to feed your growing population. Mine metal and forge weapons necessary for your army. Train your warriors and equip them with various armour and gear. Build defences to buy time for preparations and strike when you're ready for war.<br><br>You need to manage your resources well and balance between expansion and needs of your clan. Your clan members have different skill sets and will help you in unique ways.<br><br>Raiding human settlements or ambushing their caravans increases your Fear and builds your name as a true Warchief. This attracts new Orcs and allows you to expand your population. <br><br>Unlock new buildings and special units to grow your military might. Worship your Gods to gain their favour and forbidden powers. Such powers can have a devastating effect on your enemies as well as your subjects and vary depending on the chosen God.<br><br>Incite fear among enemies to gather support necessary for warchief but remember that your growing settlement will also attract human attacks so prepare your defences and train your warriors well. Defeat is not an option. A true Orc is born and dies in battle.",
