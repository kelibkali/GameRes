    "description": "Schizophrenia is a indie horror game meant to be played at your own pace. Figure out the story of a child looking for her mom while experiencing her mental illnesses with a variety of different scenes and exploration to proceed with. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplore with the intention of finding out where the ending really is. Schizophrenia is the game to play while enjoying its beauties, being relativity short but satisfying. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMade by one developer looking for constructive criticism. Get the game for the price of a cup of coffee and tell me how I can improve so I can create something that is more enjoyable.",
