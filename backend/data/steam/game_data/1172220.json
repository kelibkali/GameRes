    "description": "You start inside a spaceship where the only thing you have to do is sit down in the control chair and start travelling at hyper speed.<br />\r\nThen you receive a message from H.Q. They found the enemy base. You have to enter it and destroy the mainframe computer that controls all the robots.<br />\r\nYou have to control the spaceship, avoid the base walls, and fight with the robot squids. They'll fire at you, but you can parry with an energy shield.<br />\r\nYou rotate the ship with the WASD keys or arrow keys, fire with space and raise the shield with the 'S' or 'DOWN' arrow key.<br />\r\nThe game is quite similar to the Asteroids and River Raid. You won't lose your progress because of a checkpoint system.",
