    "description": "<i>He waited, standing like a statue just inside the entrance of the Administration<br>Wing. He had not moved in a thousand years, having no need of food or rest, and<br>never suffering from fatigue. He existed to serve his master, which gave him pleasure.<br>And every moment of those thousand years was pleasing, for his Master had bid him<br>to wait.</i><br><i>Then a whisper of thought brushed his mind. His eyes regained focus and he turned<br>his head, recognizing the pyramid of mummified Harlass Orn corpses he had carefully<br>assembled so long ago. He sensed his Masters voice, faint yet unmistakable. The<br>rift had opened again, and Agurth-Plaga called to him.</i><br>Months have passed since the Harlass Orn were freed from the Veilwalker Dreamseeker<br>in The Dreamers Awaken adventure. One of the survivors, the scholar-mage Zzhastor<br>Brune, learns that the people of Kithtakharos have begun using the ancient Harlass<br>Orn Teleportation Towers. These towers precipitated the Harlass Orn downfall, for<br>the magic employed in tower teleportation opened a rift that allowed the extra-dimensional<br>Veilwalkers to enter normal space and destroy the Harlass Orn.<br>Brune fears that the rift has been reopened, and knows of only one method that might<br>seal it before the Veilwalkers once again overwhelm the swamp. Someone must enter<br>the Harlass Orn research facility called Nhamah and retrieve the Aether Bind, a<br>device designed to close the rift.<br><i>Seal the Rift!</i> is an OGL 3.5 adventure for 4-6 characters of Ninth and Tenth<br>Levels.
