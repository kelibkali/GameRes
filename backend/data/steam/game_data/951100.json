Just head to the game website. <br><br>This paid version on Steam features achievements and automatic updates, but is otherwise much the same. This edition helps support the development of the game as further episodes are released covering the continuing insanity of Australian politics.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >THE GAME</h2><br><i><br>The Adventures Of Team Australia</i>, formerly <i>Tony Abbott and the Quest for the Suppository of Wisdom</i>, is a role-playing game in which you take control of Australia's favourite* ex-PM as he leads a band of conservative warriors in an insurgency against the filthy moderates who have taken control of the Liberal party.<br><br>There are currently two episodes: <i>The Suppository of Wisdom</i> and <i>Dutton Rising</i><br>The first episode is more of a pilot prologue, and is not included here. You can download and play it for free from the website.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >FEATURES</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Traditional RPG elements in an Australiana aesthetic<br></li><li> Dozens of Australian political figures in all their pixelated glory<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/951100/extras/1c60a62abd763827a75813285cd7a8ff.avif?t=1644101299\" width=522 height=176 /></span><br></li><li> Face-off against all sorts of enemies, including bin chickens, neckbeards, Russian trolls, keyboard warriors, hipsters, and students  <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/951100/extras/e33ef6f616c9b32fff0728255262a2cd.avif?t=1644101299\" width=549 height=108 /></span><br></li><li> Stupid political satire<br></li><li> Many spelling errors<br></li><li> Continuous development, with new episodes being released periodically</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >FAQ</h2><br><strong>This game starts with Episode 2. Is it Star Wars?</strong><br><br>No, it is not Star Wars. You can find Episode 1 on the official website, and download and play it for free.<br><br><strong>That sounds like a lot of work. Do I need to play Episode 1 to understand this game?</strong><br><br>No, you definitely don't. In fact, Episode 2 is much better, so I would encourage you to start here, and if you enjoy this game, go back and play Episode 1 afterwards. Huge improvements were made between the two episodes.<br><br><strong>If I can get this game for free from the website, why should I pay money for it here?</strong><br><br>You're certainly not obliged to! And I encourage you to check out the game for free first, if you have any reservations about investing your human dollars. The Steam version is exactly the same, but has the convenience of being on Steam with all your other games, Steam achievements, an online community (if enough people get into it), and automatic updates, including all future episodes!<br><br><strong>How frequently are these questions actually being asked? Wasn't this game just released?</strong><br><br>None of these questions has ever actually been asked before. <br><br><strong>If that is the case, who is asking them?</strong><br><br>I'm just asking them here in anticipation of the sorts of things people might be wondering. <br><br><strong>But if you're the one asking them, then who am I? Do I exist?</strong><br><br>I guess you're just also me. I don't know, I just wanted to make an FAQ, not have an existential crisis. <br><br><strong>So I suppose you're just talking to yourself. That does sound like us, actually.</strong><br><br>Yeah, but it's like talking to yourself in public, but also in this incredibly specific way on this incredibly specific online forum. <br><br><strong>Yeah, it's cool though. No one is going to be bothered reading through all this crap.</strong><br><br>Yeah, like is anyone even going to buy this game?<br><br><strong>I dunno. We did work pretty hard on it, and I think it's looking pretty good now. I'm excited to make the next episode, too</strong><br><br>Oh yeah, how is that coming along?<br><br><strong>It's going well! Lots of new graphics with a more ~Australian~ feel; red dirt, gum trees, that sort of thing.</strong><br><br>Also, why am I asking the questions now?<br><br><strong>Well, we're the same person, so it totally makes no difference</strong><br><br>That's true enough. Anyway, I gotta go. <br><br><strong>Oh yeah, me too actually. This beer isn't going to drink itself</strong><br><br>Toodleoo!",
