Your set of marbles starts in the notches of the outermost ring.  When a ring is rotated, a marble will drop through any aligned notch.  Drop through the center and you leave the board. Clear all your marbles from the board and you win.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Play solo against different computer strategies.<br></li><li>Multi-player against others in the Steam Community.<br></li><li>Select from various game options for number of players, count of marbles, starting positions, scoring, exit constraints, ...<br></li><li>Configure the board and marble appearance.<br></li><li>Game play is based on a physics simulation of ramps and rolling balls.</li></ul>This is a purposefully slow-paced, non-violent, turn-based game that gives you plenty to contemplate as you consider your next move.",
