Zusi 3 Aerosoft Edition is a train simulation for PCs, the professional version of which is also being used in railway companies for engine driver training purposes. It features faithful track recreations, authentic driving and braking behaviour, prototypical signalling and timetables, as well as various variants of the train protection systems PZB and LZB.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1040730/extras/65fe3be434e970274af063dab54f66c6.avif?t=1770892307\" width=602 height=110 /></span><br><br>Zusi 3 Aerosoft Edition is especially suited for ambitious hobby train drivers.
