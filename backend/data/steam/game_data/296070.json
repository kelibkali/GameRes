    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Change the entire environment!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Wrapped in a mind-bending tale, the gameplay of “MIND” focuses on<strong> changing the very weather in order to solve puzzles</strong>: the player will cycle between day and night, modify the levels of fog and rain and even travel in time between seasons, changing the environment to advance the gameplay-driven story —indeed, the mechanics are directly related to who the protagonist is, what has happened to him and everything he is doing: a man trapped in his own mind, he must use all the tools at his disposition to escape to reality. Accompanied by the snarky yet heartfelt narration of this comatose patient, the player will guide him through fantastical forests, dark caverns and deceptive worlds of water and ice that directly relate to his emotional state at each point in his journey.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Enhanced Edition Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Play the game in Virtual Reality for a full immersive experience.
