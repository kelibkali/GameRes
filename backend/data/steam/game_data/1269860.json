    "description": "Mazed and Bemused is a maze game, but it is also a puzzle game.  In this game the player guides an avatar through a series of mazes.  The mazes differ in size and complexity.  While in the mazes players search for clues that will be needed to solve a puzzle.  The puzzles differ in style and difficulty.  Each maze includes clues for a different puzzle.  Each puzzle leads to a four digit code that is needed to escape from the maze.",
