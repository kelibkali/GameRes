This is my first Virtual Reality game so please let me know if there are issues or concerns and I will do my best to address them ASAP. Please expect 'Ding Dong VR' to be a small, re-playable, arcade score-chaser game where the only basic goals are to constantly beat your previous score and unlock a handful of cosmetic skins for the character. This VR version adds 3D depth and effects to make it more immersive while retaining the same one button arcade pace of the non-VR version.<br><strong>Average time users played non-VR Ding Dong is approx 45-90 minutes</strong><br><br>Thank you for taking a moment to read this; I really hope you enjoy playing my game.<br><i>Adam Nickerson - Adamvision Studios</i><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/897690/extras/6088010867a41fdb9d24f907f60df774.poster.avif?t=1765917606\" width=616 height=80 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/897690/extras/6088010867a41fdb9d24f907f60df774.webm?t=1765917606\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/897690/extras/6088010867a41fdb9d24f907f60df774.mp4?t=1765917606\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Ding and Dong between the top and bottom of the screen as you attempt to avoid obstacles, collect points, and smash helpful power-ups.
