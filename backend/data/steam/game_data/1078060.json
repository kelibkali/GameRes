    "description": "A poor stonecutter notices the lifestyles of those higher in the social hierarchy and wishes to become them.  A spirit hears his plea and grants his wish.  Despite having his wish granted, The Stonecutter is still unsatisfied and wishes for more.  He dreams to become more powerful by embodying the forces of nature.   Decide The Stonecutter's fate by choosing what he should wish for! This is the ENHANCED Steam version of our Visual Novel that was released on Nintendo's Wii U.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBrave Rock Games is an independent organization that makes interactive software for young audiences.  Our current goal is to bring classic stories to digital platforms.  We believe reading is fundamentally important to any child's growth.  Some children dislike reading due to lack of visuals.  We are bringing visual story tales to these children. We have learned that disabled gamers, also enjoy our software due to simplicity of the controls and production value.  Lastly, many adults have approached us to give thanks for creating an application they can enjoy with their child.",
