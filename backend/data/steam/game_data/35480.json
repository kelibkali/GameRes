    "description": "'Dwarfs!?' offers an addictive, fast paced arcade-like experience, with plenty of difficulties and game modes to play around in!<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tAs the new overseer for your underground Dwarf base, your job is to manage the small colony and make it as rich as possible, before they meet their inevitable doom! To survive as long as possible, you’ll have to steer and guide your greedy little fellows to the richest points in the caves, while avoiding all the dangers – so they don’t end up destroying your Town Hall and its essential supply of beer.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tThey explore for you, they mine for you and they fight for you - but if you don't keep an eye on them, they'll do what they do best: die for you and take everyone else with them. But, if all else fails when the Spider Queen comes for you – use the Outpost’s Dwarf Cannon and shoot Dwarfs at her!<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are only 3 certainties in this world: death, taxes and that Dwarfs always dig too deep!<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key features</h2>\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  <li>Fun for all ages and skill levels of gamers, with randomly-generated caves so the game is different every time.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  </li><li>Madly Addictive Arcade Mode: 4 difficulty levels ranging from casual to crazy hard-core, time limits from 5 minutes to endless, randomly-generated caves and all the gold and monsters you can handle!<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  </li><li>Base Defense Mode: Tower Defense gameplay, except you don’t have a tower.
