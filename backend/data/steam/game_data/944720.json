    "description": "<i>Hellbanger </i>is a ripping, smashing, <strong>crushingly-brutal</strong> top-down action game.  Crank up the combo meter as you bash your skull through swarm upon swarm of <strong>demonic monstrosities,</strong> fueled by a randomly generated face-melting <strong>death metal soundtrack.</strong>  Shatter the skulls strewn about the arena to collect coveted treasure, but don't let your greed cause you to drop your combo! Compete with your friends and the rest of the world to set a<strong> high score!</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>All Gameplay, No Bullshit: No experience points, no story beats, no microtransactions. Nothing to unlock.</li><li>Insane Speed: Like the death metal it takes inspiration from, the lightning fast pace of <i>Hellbanger</i> will push your reflexes to the limit as you dodge fireballs, avoid puddles of slimy ooze, and charge in to attack your foes. </li><li>Endless Enemies: Survive as long as you can while being bombarded by the demons of Hell, and jump right back into a new run when you inevitably fall in battle.  Random enemy spawns mean no two runs are ever quite the same.<br></li><li>Killer Soundtrack: Experience a brand new, randomly generated death metal track every time you play.  Each track is given a new title based on the most grotesque death metal tropes.</li></ul>",
