    "description": "<strong><i>Incel, a portmanteau of “involuntarily celibate” is a term coined by a female Canadian academic known as Alana in the 1990s. There are potentially tens of millions of involuntarily celibate people in the world, usually among the younger generations. Interestingly, the press has labeled all or most of them as terrorists, due to the actions of a couple of self-identifying incels. Most violent crime globally is committed by sexually active individuals. The people at Soiree Games neither identify as incel nor condone violence, instead we merely hope journalists re-disocover their integrity.</i></strong><br><br>Can YOU defeat 7004 enemies in one sitting?<br><br>Incel Clicker is fun, casual grinding with raging boomers, miniguns, and all the major Soiree hallmarks, including a rousing soundtrack and plenty of challenge.<br><br>• Select your protagonist from a posse of six dynamic champions, including Bats, the only female with Klinefertel Syndrome and Sober Cole, a time-travelling alcoholic<br>• Collect coins and purchase special attacks, such as a righteous volley of minigun fire and the legendary Autistic Screech!<br>• Play the Wheel of Incel (if you dare) to either win amazing prizes - or a terminal case of untreated depression<br>• Use Pick Up Artist books to summon beta male orbiters who will either work for you or the enemy<br>• Face off with manchildren, trolls, furries and hundreds of other powerful foes<br>• Open chests to discover special items, such as cucumbers, lube, fedoras, and many others",
