    "description": "Retro Rocket Robot is a 2d platformer game. But instead of jump &amp; run your locomotion options are fly &amp; slide using the rocket backpack and motion force field. Manage the robot through the caves, find a way out of the mazes by collecting all the energy coins in them. Survive evil traps, solve little puzzles and avoid touching enemies and lava walls, some of them can be destroyed by plasma laser or bombs. This is 80's gameplay, freshened up with modern graphics and game elements like checkpoins and level selection.",
