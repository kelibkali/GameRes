    "description": "High school is a wild ride. A cesspool of body image and toxicity. A rancid petri dish of raging hormones left unattended and sprouting fungal infections that use the word 'gay' as an insult. And you just started your first day of Freshman year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy Story is a difficult precision platformer with a strong emphasis on narrative, so strong that it's embedded into the blocks you jump on. Jump and dash through friendship, trust, betrayal, and a mildly concerning amount of caffeine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContent Warning:<br />\r\nMy Story contains themes of suicide, mental illness, and cringey dialogue",
