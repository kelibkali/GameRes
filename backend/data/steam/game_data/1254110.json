    "description": "<strong>Quarres </strong>(&quot;squares&quot; in Middle French) is a 2D puzzle in which your goal is to match the tiles in your board with the pattern on a sample board. <br><br>BUT THERE IS A CATCH! You cannot move only one tile at a time. Moving a tile will move either its whole row or column. Think of it as a 2D version of those popular physical cube puzzles.<br><br>PROCEDURALLY GENERATED PUZZLES. Quarres generates it's boards using a pseudorandom number generator. This allows for a giant amount of possible combinations while also letting you share with friends specific puzzles by using a seed number.",
