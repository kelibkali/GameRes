    "description": "It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships striking from a hidden base have won their first victory over the evil Galactic empire. However, during this battle, our brave hero Abda lost his father. After his death, he remained the only one of his kind. Everyone he loved died. After the funeral, he inherited his father's old starship. After fixing the flying saucer he had inherited, Abda got ready to go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThus began the story of Abda Redeemer.<br />\r\nIt's time for redemption.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this game, you play as the main character, whose name is Abda.<br />\r\nThe gameplay is inspired by old retro games.
