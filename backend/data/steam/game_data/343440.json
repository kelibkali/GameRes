Connectivity is never a problem!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/343440/extras/7afc7a900b5f400993d018c165e2201a.avif?t=1599138737\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br>Ready for a car RPG leveling system that we’ve gone crazy?!<br>Every car has four statistics: top speed, nitro, acceleration and grip. By using nitro, you increase this car’s nitro capacity, by driving at top speed you increase your top speed...you get the drift? When a car has all of it’s four statistics raised to 10/10, you will gain an overall level which allows you to buy a new car and earns you prestige on the in-game scoreboard and the Steam leaderboard.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/343440/extras/748219e6abb8ab180c899205a81ce972.avif?t=1599138737\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br>Since the tank is such a popular vehicle in the main game modes, we decided to dedicate one entire game mode to it. In CD2: Tank Battles you choose one of five unique tanks and strive to dominate the arena. Shoot or bump opponents off this sky arena to score points, extra points are awarded for special achievements such as multi kills, revenge, air shots and so on.<br>When playing this game mode offline, bots(A.I.) will fill the opponent slots. This way the singleplayer is also fully playable.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/343440/extras/ce15a0ebfe1c9b419f375461e8d35f29.avif?t=1599138737\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br>Crash Drive 2 originally started as a tablet game.
