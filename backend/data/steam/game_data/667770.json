Two more chapters are in the works and will be released as they are finished. The price of this game will increase as more chapters are added. We're in early access and still have some kinks to work out, but it's quite stable and offers approximately an hour, to hour and a half, of play time.<br><br><br><strong>Gameplay features include:</strong><br>- Rich and detailed environments.<br>- Puzzles and interactions built for tracked motion controllers.<br>- Teleporting not required. In fact it’s not even recommended! (unless your play space is under the minimum Room-Scale measurements of 2.8m x 2.8m).<br>- Lots of logical and dexterity puzzles.<br>- Graphic and control settings options.<br>- Floor height adjustment setting (especially useful when letting a taller, or shorter, friend have a play session).",
