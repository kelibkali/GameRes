    "description": "Congratulations, you got the job! You're the new keeper for the lighthouse on the Pale, an abandoned island off the coast of Maine. Unlock the mysteries of the island's dark past in this 90s inspired survival-horror!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Pale is an oldskool, atmosphere-first PSX style horror game straight outta the 90s. It's locked to 240p (please do not adjust your television sets) with a crisp 4:3 aspect ratio.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe demo is the first full act of the game, about an hour of playtime. The full release is planned for 2023.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can support by simply playing the demo, wishlisting it for when it's ready, and leaving feedback on the discords to help guide development,",
