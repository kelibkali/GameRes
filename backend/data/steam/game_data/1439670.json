While its zombie laborers have long and successfully tended to its fields, creating produce that is essential to Geb's political standing with its neighbors, some of these shipments haven't been making it to their intended destinations, and the Pathfinders have been asked to serve as neutral arbiters during an investigation that will take place near the docks of Geb's greatest port.<br><i> Written by:</i><br><strong> Cass Reyfield and James Case</strong><br><strong> Scenario tags</strong> : None<br><i> This product is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
