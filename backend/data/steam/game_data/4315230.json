The temple serves as  congregation spot between  fortune tellers and their Gods, also known as the Celestials. Entry to outsiders was strictly forbidden but Iblis tricks the fortune tellers to get inside. He learns  that In order for divinations to take place the God's  demand 'unique' offering. Unique in the sense something they have never been offered before. Thus recent news about biblical relics moving out of a renovating museum serves as a golden opportunity for Iblis to snatch what he believes, is something different. While the relics are flown mid-air by civilian chopper, they are taken down with ease. One injured survivor find a way out. He is your Grandpa Albert Perry, a museum curator who engages in a brave tussle with Iblis for the priceless relics. Grandpa sends a SOS message to John, mentioning his whereabouts before going silent. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4315230/extras/01360161c15b4f809e3d4d3364d4b52d.poster.avif?t=1772121376\" width=426 height=240 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4315230/extras/01360161c15b4f809e3d4d3364d4b52d.webm?t=1772121376\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4315230/extras/01360161c15b4f809e3d4d3364d4b52d.mp4?t=1772121376\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > <strong>Gameplay:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Foul Deeds of Iblis is a  <strong>horror game</strong> where you play as John Perry and must serve <strong>two objectives</strong>.
