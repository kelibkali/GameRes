Expand your Trainz collection with a huge range of additional routes, sessions, locos and rolling stock, all at <strong>75% off</strong> the regular pricing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >SEE ALSO - Trainz Railroad Simulator 2019</h2>The latest version of Trainz delivers better graphics, improved performance and greater stability (plus a whole range of new content). Search the Steam Store.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><u><strong>What makes Trainz so special?</strong></u></h2><br>Trainz: A New Era is far more than a train simulator. Sure there are hundreds of locos and dozens of routes and sessions you can drive in the Platinum Edition Bundle. But the real power of Trainz comes with all the extra things you can do beyond the builtin-in content set.<br><br>All the tools to build your own railroad are included, and in fact, every route you see in Trainz is created by customers just like you. There are now well over 10,000 routes available on the Trainz Download Station (DLS) that you can download for free and enjoy. So when people tell you &quot;you have to buy lots of DLC&quot; remind them that the choice is theirs, with plenty of high quality free routes and content available on the DLS.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><u><strong>Key Features</strong></u></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >All-new graphics engine with full world shadows and per-pixel lighting</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/315660/extras/456564d5326e057b63307300b9980425.avif?t=1723526427\" width=616 height=445 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Multiplayer</h2> <br>Share your enthusiasm with other rail fans and combine your efforts with others to operate a working rail line!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Our most accurate simulation yet with real time world physics and editing tools!</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/315660/extras/a2a32ab00ff728a98c402c9c4cb6655d.avif?t=1723526427\" width=616 height=311 /></span><br><br>Our physics use a variety of configurable inputs such as engine powers, train weight and rolling resistance whilst taking into account factors like track gradient, curve resistance and track adhesion for each train car when accelerating or decelerating. The brand new real time physics editing tools allow players to tune physics 'on-the-fly' to take their simulation's performance even further.<br><br>Brand-new Real-time Physics Editing tools enable users to enter known specifications to accurately monitor all the forces at work. Things like tractive effort, drawbar pull or brake pipe pressure can be monitored at a specific point along the train and input values adjusted &quot;on-the-fly&quot;. By analysing and tuning performance without leaving the simulation, real-world train characteristics can be matched perfectly. (It's a bit like running a virtual dynamometer car).<br><br>If physics aren't your thing, don't worry. You can leave the fine-tuning of your favourite locomotive's performance to the experts whilst still having the choice between 'Realistic Mode' or 'Easy Mode' driving options.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Procedurally animated spline junctions</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/315660/extras/954d52bae70885876bd074325d6f841d.avif?t=1723526427\" width=616 height=260 /></span><br><br>An updated set of track laying tools are provided in Surveyor to automatically adds frogs/vee, blades, and checkrails in the correct place on the tracks when making a switch, turnout or junction.
