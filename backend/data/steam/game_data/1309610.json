Configure your command lines to filter out certain units to flank your enemies, dig-in or feed distant frontlines.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1309610/extras/5217b79140411a4888169fcc47955b21.poster.avif?t=1746615438\" width=614 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1309610/extras/5217b79140411a4888169fcc47955b21.webm?t=1746615438\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1309610/extras/5217b79140411a4888169fcc47955b21.mp4?t=1746615438\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1309610/extras/0184fb7c3cef350b45b6ecc17cd0dea0.webp?t=1746615438\" width=614 height=50 /></span>This game has a never-before-seen approach that lets you focus on drawing commands and executing a strategy rather than managing individual units.
