The world has turned dark. A shadow government comprising of high level officers, top leaders of powerful nations and some extremely rich multinational firms have come together to create an A.I. that has taken over every aspect of human life. They have employed cybernetic beings as guards that monitor and make sure you are a &quot;good citizen&quot;, otherwise you are eliminated.<br><br>This oppressive rule soon led to a war after which we see the events of Spark Five unfold. Humans were almost wiped out, except for some colonies in moons of a certain gas giant. Complete the Spark campaign to save humanity, it is up to you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>About The Music</strong></h2>These are ambiences that define the mood of each chapter of the Spark Campaign. The title tracks are named after Spark Campaign chapters. The music is not found within the game, in-game music is not for sale.<br><br><strong>All audio files are .wav 44,100 Hz, 16 Bit, Stereo.</strong>",
