    "description": "When a probe discovers remains of an ancient civilization on a distant moon, an exploration of the site becomes the top priority of the United Earth’s space agency. Due to the extreme distances and the harsh uninhabitable environment of the moon, it will be possible to get an expedition there - but not back.<br><br>In its final week the expedition realizes that one of the alien devices at the site may be used to travel between worlds. What seemed to be a one way trip could suddenly turn into an intergalactic odyssey. But first, a course must be set by unlocking the vehicle's holographic navigational system.<br><br><i>Toran is a sci-fi puzzle adventure &quot;short game&quot; in virtual reality.</i>",
