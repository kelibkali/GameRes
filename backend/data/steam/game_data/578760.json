    "description": "In a black void, several hundred thousand tiny cubes dance and flow around gravitational fields emitted from the Vive controllers. Endless hypnotic and beautiful behaviours emerge from the simplest of physical laws.<br><br>Psyia is a custom GPU-accelerated physics system. Enter the StarLab and become a rainbow wizard (or witch), casting innumerable multicoloured particles around a void. The world pulses and morphs in time with the music and every detail of the simulation is tweakable to your exact tastes.<br><br>Or, for something more relaxing, enter Meditation mode, with support for laying, floor-sit, chair-sit or standing modes. Put your controllers down and watch as the particles dance and flow the meditation crystals, a peaceful and never-repeating ambient soundtrack of chimes guide you inwards.<br><br>Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> GPU-powered physics-controller particle system with hundreds of thousands of particles possible on VR minimum-spec PCs<br></li><li> Audio-reactive: automatically picks up the audio playing from your PC (so works with Spotify, YouTube, etc)<br></li><li> Includes the album 'Escape the Tangle' by ColorPulse by default<br></li><li> StarLab Mode, where you can customise tons of options creating almost anything you can imagine<br></li><li> Meditation Mode, where you can lay back on some pillows and just watch the patterns emerge</li></ul>",
