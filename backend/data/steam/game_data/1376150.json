The most popular event is the &quot;Carnage Circuit,&quot; a deadly race where drivers battle not only to win, but to rack up points by running over pedestrians scattered along the track. These races take place on sprawling urban highways, twisted industrial zones, and abandoned cityscapes, all filled with traps, hazards, and innocent civilians caught in the chaos. The only rule is there are no rules.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Each race features a roster of fearless, violent competitors, all vying for supremacy. Drivers are armed with heavily modified vehicles, equipped with spikes, cannons, and mechanical claws designed to cause maximum destruction. The racetrack itself is a warzone, with pedestrians acting as both obstacles and targets. As the drivers tear through the streets at breakneck speeds, they are rewarded for every life they claim, with bonus points for particularly gruesome kills.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Points are accumulated based on the number of pedestrians hit, and extra rewards are given for particularly spectacular or violent takedowns. The more damage a driver inflicts, the higher their rank, and the ultimate prize is not only victory but the status of being crowned the most ruthless racer in the world. The race is broadcast to the masses, who cheer and jeer as the competitors vie for dominance, fueling the twisted entertainment of the dystopian world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Survival is key—race after race, the line between driver and monster begins to blur, with many of the competitors succumbing to the madness of the game, willing to sacrifice their humanity for fame and fortune. In this world, victory is measured in blood, and only the most merciless prevail.</p>",
