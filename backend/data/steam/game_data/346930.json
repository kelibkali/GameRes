    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > COMMAND YOUR ARMY. HACK YOUR ENEMY TO PIECES. TURN THE HILLS RED. </h2><br>Deadhold is a gore infused, fast-action, tactical RTS. With support for up to 4 coop players, the gritty dark fantasy world of Deadhold comes to life through its story driven campaign. In multiplayer, Deadhold supports up to 8 players in teams or 4 players in free for all, and a variety of game modes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > A NEW KIND OF RTS </h2><br>Deadhold’s gameplay is a unique mix of real-time tactics essentials like strategic positioning, unit classes, and physically based simulation similar to such classic games as Myth and Dawn of War 2, combined with the items, loot, and leveling found in action RPGs like Diablo and Path Of Exile. The result is a fresh take on the tactical RTS that should delight fans of both RTS and ARPG genres.<br><br>Battles in Deadhold are physically modeled. The flight of an arrow is realistically simulated and will embed inside a units head, arms, legs or chest. Unit movement is based on physics, increasing the value of tactical positioning: A line of warriors can block incoming enemies or force them to engage or go around. The explosive bomb wielded by the Sapper can literally dismember units as body parts explode and fly into the air. Injuries and severed limbs stain the ground realistically with blood.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >CAMPAIGN</h2><br>A dark force has risen in the west, obliterating any who stand in its wake. The last living races have banded together to change the course of fate, setting Deadhold's campaign in motion. Told from the perspective of the narrator, you'll uncover the history of the blight, and the truth that lies behind their creation. The 16 mission campaign challenges you to wield the power of the gods, using tactics and strategy to overcome the onslaught of an overwhelming evil force.<br><br>In campaign, the scale of Deadhold’s player choice becomes clear. As a paragon of the Empire, players will choose a Deity in which to specialize. Spells are unlocked as players earn experience, allowing them to customize their play style. Players can further customize their builds by slotting relics, runes, and gems, which can drop from defeated enemies. <br><br>A tier based leveling system adds significant replay value to the campaign missions. As players progress through each tier, new and greater challenges and rewards await them: boss-fights, different enemy patrols and tactics, additional mission objectives, and higher quality items.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >MULTIPLAYER</h2><br>Competitive multiplayer in Deadhold supports team and free for all play, with up to 8 players in a variety of maps and gamemodes. Leaderboards and tournaments are planned additions during Steam Early Access.",
