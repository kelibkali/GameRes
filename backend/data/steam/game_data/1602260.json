    "description": "With this simulator you will be able to live the real, hard and tiring experience of a steel worker.<br />\r\nIn the metalworking workshops there are different tasks to be carried out. <br />\r\nIn the simulator I have summarized just some of the activities, the ones that I consider most significant to make you understand what it means to work today in the steel industry.<br />\r\nMachines can't do everything a man does. For this reason you will see that the work is carried out partly with your contribution and partly with the help of automatic machines or anthropomorphic industrial robots.<br />\r\nIt is up to you to keep the work environment clean, start up the plants and robotic islands, load the conveyor belts and manage the transport of the material using the forklift.<br />\r\nWhat you will see in this game are not invented things, but are approximate reconstructions of industrial plants that really exist.<br />\r\nI myself have lived this experience live and now I want to tell you about it...",
