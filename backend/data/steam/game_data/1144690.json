    "description": "In short: Project SolarBot is a Metroidvania!<br />\r\nYou'll visit the freely explorable planet E.R.S. as a SolarBot. Recover long forgotten technologies and upgrades to unlock new abilities and save your home!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut keep your solar meter constantly in mind.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAvoid dark places and stay in the light to avoid surprising shutdowns.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the last salvation of a civilization you'll be sent on the mission to gather as much information and data as possible in order to <br />\r\nprevent the decline of your homeland. Maybe you'll find a new home for your creators?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nE.R.S. is a planet full of different landscapes and complex cave systems. Often times you'll reach dead ends, whose overcoming will cost more<br />\r\nthan mere force of arms. Always think of your energy supply while researching though. If the &quot;SU&quot; drops to 0, it means Game Over! Look for light sources and solar tanks to keep your systems up and running.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n--- Watch out, Speedrunners! ---<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the built-in timer function you'll have your current time always displayed on screen. <br />\r\nBut watch out: in this game, sprinting costs valuable energy. So what do you prefer? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWeak and fast or slow and strong? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWill you find the route that'll lead you to that one run?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n--- The influence and inspiration--- <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis one is obvious: It's Super Metroid through and through. And I tried to reflect that in every pixel and every note played, without transforming into<br />\r\nan uninspired copy.",
