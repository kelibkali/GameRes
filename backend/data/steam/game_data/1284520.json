    "description": "Experience one of the first and most popular Dota 2 Music Packs, now in a Soundtrack form!  Heroes Within mixes exhilarating, colorful action music with edgy rock and fantasy overtones. Dota 2 - Heroes Within by composer Daniel Sadowski was one of the first Music Packs to come out for Dota 2. It went on to become very popular within the Dota 2 Game Community. The &quot;Roshan&quot; track went on to become very popular at Dota 2 Tournaments. For the first time ever, you can hear all of the tracks as they were meant to be heard, as a cohesive Soundtrack. Sometimes within the game, certain layers and stems of music will be deactivated, so it is hard to hear the music as a whole, but as a Soundtrack you can hear all of the music together. Many Dota 2 fans have requested Heroes Within as a Soundtrack Album for a long time. Now it's finally here! Also included with the Soundtrack is a new Bonus Track that never made it into the game.",
