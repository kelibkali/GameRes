It's about the kind of heroes that are defeated, and how much cash you can get after defeating them. To defeat heroes, though, you need a dungeon. You decide to form your own Hero Defeating company and franchise a location from Exemplary Villain Industries LLC. They help you lure heroes and assist with payroll and you have a place to defeat heroes.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2087230/extras/0cb828c40720158fda30c6af949a6688.poster.avif?t=1748640080\" width=800 height=450 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2087230/extras/0cb828c40720158fda30c6af949a6688.webm?t=1748640080\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2087230/extras/0cb828c40720158fda30c6af949a6688.mp4?t=1748640080\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong><i>Managerial Duties</i></strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >As a boss, having minions under your command is a perk, and keeping them on payroll is in your best interest. Minions risk their lives with Royalty Acquisitions, as any good evil doer needs to have a couple lures for heroes. Depending on the Royal acquired, new, stronger heroes will attempt to challenge you, leaving you more money as they're defeated. Minions also construct traps, and if you give them some armor and a sword, they'll stand guard at checkpoints, too. Minions are not little playthings, however. They have feelings and mouths to feed as well. Pay them well and they will treat you well, else you might have to negotiate with union leaders. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2087230/extras/aba3c77b92ae47ec68ab1b6d4bf3047b.poster.avif?t=1748640080\" width=800 height=450 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2087230/extras/aba3c77b92ae47ec68ab1b6d4bf3047b.webm?t=1748640080\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2087230/extras/aba3c77b92ae47ec68ab1b6d4bf3047b.mp4?t=1748640080\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Managerial duties goes beyond just the first lair your company owns.

Everything out of the dungeon will be liquidated in order to keep the company afloat. People still have mouths to feed, after all. If the company goes under, then it's game over.</p>",
