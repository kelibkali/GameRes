No purchased assets except sounds and music. Making it a real solo indie game.<br><br>The number of helicopters will also increase, as the city size. Updates will come regularly. The game is not heavy, but requires a good processor. By adjusting options you can reduce LOD levels, shadows, reflections and other options making a very light game, working even in old notebooks with integrated graphics like Intel HD 4000 and a Due Core Processor.<br><br>This game was formally released in alpha as MegaCityCopter outside Steam.",
