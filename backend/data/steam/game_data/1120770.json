    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gods of Havoc heralds a return to the classic God-Game.</h2>Gods of Havoc is a three-part series offering difficult, turn-based strategy. Each game places the player as a god in different eras of a planet’s history. 'Gods of Havoc: Fall to Earth' takes place in a medieval setting on a global scale.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gods of Havoc: Fall to Earth</h2>You take the roll of a god, to a sentient, and self-governing populace. With no interference from you, your people will spread out across the land, create villages, temples, taverns, and castles; go to war, build fantastic structures, and reshape the landscape… that is, they would, if there weren’t other gods, and other races, waiting to stop them.<br>As a god, you have the power to aid your people with powerful magics, and to guide their progress with suggestions and dreams. Even with your help, it may not be enough to defeat the brutal and magical forces building against them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Series</h2>Don't forget to check out, and wishlist, the another pending game in the series, Gods of Havok: Into the Void<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Game</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A turn-based strategy game.<br></li><li>Battle against six other gods.<br></li><li>see the landscape change based on which god owns it: swamps, volcanoes, deserts, tundras,wastelands, and arctic.<br></li><li>An intelligent simulation of population expansion, exploration, and exploitation.<br></li><li>Use a ‘Pass-Time’ option to move the game forward,<br></li><li>And customise a log to alert you when certain events happen.<br></li><li>A fiendishly difficult AI with various difficulties.<br></li><li>Crafted from a love of Populous, Megalomania, and other ancient god-game classics!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Your People</h2>At the core of the game, is the civilisation you are nurturing. They will begin by building up the world around them, training warriors, priests, farmers and foragers, establishing defence armies, sending out prophets to convert their neighbours, and eventually begin work on a grand city and magical armies. So long as no other race stops them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Your Role</h2>As your people’s protector you can help them on their expansion across the globe. The more followers you have, the more powerful you become.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Create webs to slow enemies, trapsto damage them, or summon werewolves, rabid lions, or werebears.<br></li><li>Empower your people’s army to become a holy crusader and let them seek out enemies, or guide them on a crusade.<br></li><li>Bless and manufacture your people’s villages to increase their population and produce more mana for you.<br></li><li>Cast winds, floods, fire, and plagues on enemy villages to kill off their population.<br></li><li>Convert or destroy enemy armies using the Hand of God.<br></li><li>Turn ancient monoliths into powerful angels and demons, or magical castles to fortify your people’s position.   </li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Enemies   </h2>                     <br>Unfortunately for your people, you are not the only god.
