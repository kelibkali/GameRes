    "description": "You have to know Superman and his supernatural powers. Batman, who's speeding through the streets of Gotham in his Batmobile. Or Spider-Man, who jumps on blocks without any problems. So meet SuperMoose. Here doesn't have a car, he doesn't jump on blocks (in fact he's afraid of heightS), he desn't even have a beautiful beloved one. He's just a moose, but not so ordinary! Maybe he don't know karate, muay thai, and jujitsu, but he has a huge heart! When someone needs help in the woods, he's the first... to run away!<br />\r\n So far the forest lived peacefully. There was no indication of the upcoming tragedy. The Company engaged in construction of houses, wants to take over the forest and cut it out completely, depriving animals of their natural home, and build blocks of flats. Animals are not too happy. Someone wants to evict them without leaving anything in return. Everyoneis panicking! They don't know what to do! Is there someone who can help them? It seems that there's one animal that didn't show any sign of fear ... it's SuperMoose. But not because he is so brave, he just went asleep and missed the whole ruckus. Now he has to stop people before they damage the forest. Animals cannot lose their natural environment. All hope lies in the hands (or hooves) of SuperMoose...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFEATURES: <br />\r\n- The game honors the best old casual games.<br />\r\n- Six levels with various tasks.<br />\r\n- Caricature, cartoon characters.<br />\r\n- Your character has a lot of skills like a real superhero, use them to carry out their missions!<br />\r\n-Explore the colorful world and have fun!",
