    "description": "&quot;Sky Seeker&quot; is a game that aims to drop the enemy at the target location.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's easy to play and you can win by hitting an enemy and pushing it out of the field.<br />\r\nPlayers will lose if they fall outside like the enemy.<br />\r\nTherefore, avoid it so that it will not hit the enemy's attack, or stay inside the field so that it will not fall outside.<br />\r\nThe enemy has stamina and can be reduced by attacking.<br />\r\nThe less this stamina, the larger the pushing distance.<br />\r\nAnd the protagonist can charge the attack, and the more he does, the bigger the enemy can be pushed out.<br />\r\nIf you can blow away the enemy by hitting the maximum charge attack with the enemy's stamina reduced, you can feel very exhilarating so please try playing.",
