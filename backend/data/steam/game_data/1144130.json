    "description": "Milrendir is said to be brimming with riches long forgotten, left behind after the Dwarves that inhabited were forced out of the area by something sinister. <br>You (and a friend? co-op) are the latest to attempt to plunder the depths of the stronghold, in your quest for untold wealth. What you were not told is that many before you have tried, and none have returned. <br>In the depths of Milrendir something evil stirs. Do you have what it takes to destroy the evil within, claim the riches that lie beneath and more importantly be return with the prize?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Procedural Dungeons</h2>Smash Dungeon is a new game from indie developer Plastic Cow Games taking inspiration from arcade classics to bring you procedurally generated dungeon mayhem creating dungeons with traps, secret areas, shops and special rooms.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Hordes of Enemies</h2>There are many enemies to defeat in the dungeons beneath Milrendir, from shambling skeletons, charging metal hulks, exploding skull tossing crawlers, farting pigs and more - and that's before you reach the bosses.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Relics</h2>To help aid you in your quest for riches there are many Relics scattered throughout the dungeon such as a Dragons Tooth granting a chance to ignite an enemy, Orbs of protection, and many different types of Armour to help bolster your feeble stats and many more. Who knows you may even find some Legendary Relics.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Power ups</h2>To further help in your quest some enemies drop single use items such as bombs that can kill enemies or uncover secret areas, phoenix flames to incinerate your foe, extra health and more. Not to mention Weapon Boosts which can provide chain lightning, projectile slash effects and repel giving you that little extra to clear a room.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Runes</h2>Runes are sometimes granted when you clear a room of enemies. These give the ability to passively improve your character from areas like attack &amp; defense to defying death itself and more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Help is at hand</h2>But if it all seems a bit too much to handle don't worry, play with a friend in couch co-op. <br>Fight through the hordes of enemies, dispatching them in a variety of ways such as Melee, bombs, Phoenix flames, chain lightning, towers and more.",
