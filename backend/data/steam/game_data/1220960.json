    "description": "Be a slime monster and go on a journey to become a king, god, demon, pie and more! Take the medieval world by storm as your purposeful actions and occasional bumbling shapes the future!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInspired by choose-your-own-adventure books, your every choice will lead to new and exciting things. Experience a part of the ~50,000 words of story that ranges from absurd and silly to bittersweet. (It's mostly silly though.) <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Revolutionary 'Back' button technology! Don't like the ending you got? Just go back and make different choices. No more trying to remember the dozens of decisions you made just for it to lead to a slightly different finale.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-37 of the over 150 endings! Unlock new paths, artwork and options as you find 'em all!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Secrets! Lurking among the text and blank spaces are hidden endings, can you find them?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Hand-drawn artwork of adorable slimes! Did you ever want to see a slime in an apron, undersized ranger garb or fabulous crown? Well, you can see those and more in the demo!",
