After graduating from UCLA with a degree in Music Composition, Velasco pursued his passion to write music for visual media; his first major release was composing for Sony’s blockbuster God of War. <br><br>A prolific and versatile composer, Velasco has become one of the most sought-after composers in interactive entertainment, scoring many major titles including Company of Heroes 2, Mass Effect 3, Borderlands 2, ZombiU, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine, God of War 3, Tron: Evolution, Borderlands, God of War 2, Darksiders, Clive Barker’s Jericho, and many more. <br><br>Velasco also composes for independent films, trailers, and commercials for high-profile clients such as Coca-Cola, Disney, Lexus and Mercedes. His music has been licensed for numerous movies, documentaries and television shows. In addition, Velasco arranged, orchestrated, and conducted multiple arrangements of the Monday Night Football theme currently airing on ESPN. <br><br>Cris Velasco’s orchestral music is performed in concerts worldwide and has received numerous accolades including &quot;Best Original Score&quot; from the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences, &quot;Best Original Music&quot; nomination from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, NBC News' &quot;Best Video Game Music of 2012&quot;, GameTrailers' &quot;Best Soundtrack of the Year&quot; and IGN's &quot;People's Choice Award - Best Overall Music&quot;.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About Sascha Dikiciyan</h2><br>German-born Sascha Dikiciyan is one of today's most sought after interactive soundtrack composers. Working under the name Sonic Mayhem, Sascha's unique blend of cutting-edge electronics and cinematic score compositions has driven some of the most successful game franchises of the last fifteen years, including Quake, Mass Effect, Tron and Borderlands.<br><br>Sascha's approach, combining unique sound elements with an intensely detailed cinematic layer, has won him both critical acclaim and industry accolades. <br><br>The canvas of today's gaming landscape is vast, and Sascha's approach to the epic soundscape pays homage to cinema while simultaneously exploring the outer reaches of sound, capturing the singular flavor of hyper-interactive battles. As the gaming sector surpasses film in both budgets and creativity, Sascha is one of the few composers working today capable of keeping pace and charting new territory. Sascha is also an original recording artist and sought-after remixer, and his first artist release 'Doomsday' will see a release sometime in 2014.",
