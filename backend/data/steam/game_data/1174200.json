He can increase his health, armor, speed, and his average damage by using potions, honing machines, sacred rocks, and beetles. There are three types of potions available and they affect Heragos' core stats when used whereas sacred rocks help him fight against his enemies during missions and combats. Heragos can use the honing machine to improve his weapon in three different specs: sharpness, weight, and durability. An NPC blacksmith is required to upgrade the weapon to the next level. Players can collect beetles by slicing clot worms, digging up beetle nests, and opening beetle chests, and can use them in the stat menu to dynamically increase/decrease sub-stats of Heragos. These sub-stats give players a chance to elastically adopt a gameplay style that serves their desire. See the stat menu below for more details and a better visualization:<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1174200/extras/23b82ad935b8f95332edc5d03b9118b3.avif?t=1606052898\" width=600 height=312 /></span><br><br></li><li> <strong>Customize Your Character</strong><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1174200/extras/f107771c6286651164bda89abb089881.poster.avif?t=1606052898\" width=576 height=324 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1174200/extras/f107771c6286651164bda89abb089881.webm?t=1606052898\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br>Along with many other features, Lands of Pharaoh: Episode 1 comes with a dynamic market system.
