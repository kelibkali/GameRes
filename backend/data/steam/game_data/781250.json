    "description": "Congratulations Don Jonz! You have just won a Virtual Adventure Vacation on Eternam, the biggest and best planetary Funpark in the galaxy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHard working intergalactic Space Marshals like yourself deserve to experience the ultimate gateway. Travel through 3D landscapes to more than a half-dozen past human eras, populated with life-like-bio=tech creatures offering tongue-in-cheek remarks. From the age of the pharaohs and the realm of medieval knights to the French Revolution and beyond, you'll have the adventure of a lifetime...or several.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut, Mister Jonz, there is a slight problem... Dragoons still inhabit Eternam wanting to reclaim the park and have joined forces with your arch-rival Mikhal Nuke. They plan to ruin your vacation in a big way!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt least you can count on help from the beautiful Tracy, a technician on the Eternam coordination team. Unfortunately, to escape Nuke's evil clutches,, she has dematerialized into the Funpark's computer network, so Tracy will communicate only via a computer screen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou'll need intuition, courage, wit, diplomacy, charm and a surreal sense of humor. Only you can save Eternam - and yourself. But who wouldn't face all challenges to win Tracy's smile. So...Enjoy your vacation, Mister Jonz!",
