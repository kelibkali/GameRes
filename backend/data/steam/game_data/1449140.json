    "description": "<strong>Brief history of the game.</strong><br>Foglight is the first Unreal Engine game from DangerousBob. If you are visiting this store page you are one of the few to have discovered this little horror game that helped build the foundation for DangerousBob Studio LLC. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449140/extras/7203af2dc7291fde1ff056760e08e6cb.avif?t=1683725773\" width=600 height=251 /></span><br><br><strong>Foglight </strong>is a single player horror game set around a pursuer, Farberto, that pushes the player to fight for their life. All the while you play, Farberto is learning and getting stronger. <br>You play as a new Lighthouse Keeper, known as a Wickie, that finds out they are not alone on the night's watch. Open world, the game has multiple endings depending on how you play. Best of luck!<br><br><strong>Features: </strong><br><br><strong>An AI that does not &quot;Cheat&quot;</strong><br>Unlike in other horror games, this AI plays by the same rules as you. The AI gets harder as time goes on, and reacts to your actions.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449140/extras/16f52f83f9f3a002b1a759046fb08d17.poster.avif?t=1683725773\" width=600 height=250 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449140/extras/16f52f83f9f3a002b1a759046fb08d17.webm?t=1683725773\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449140/extras/16f52f83f9f3a002b1a759046fb08d17.mp4?t=1683725773\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Free Roam</strong><br>The game is set on an open Island, that you are free to explore. Save spots are rare, as the game was intended to be very challenging. <br><br><strong>Survival Horror</strong><br>You will be faced with a Foe that will never stop coming after you. Never. The AI is on a bell curve that will make it try harder as time goes on. Jump scares naturally happen, and you have to stay alert at all times.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449140/extras/ca89116ff10c841b6307600e1d901797.poster.avif?t=1683725773\" width=600 height=250 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449140/extras/ca89116ff10c841b6307600e1d901797.webm?t=1683725773\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449140/extras/ca89116ff10c841b6307600e1d901797.mp4?t=1683725773\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Challenging Puzzles</strong><br>The Island is packed full of secrets and puzzles for you to explore.
