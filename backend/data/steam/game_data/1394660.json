(2/26/26)</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A 15-year-old boy genius named Cole Andrews finds himself in the Virtual World, unsure of how it happened. Upon further reflection, comes to the conclusion that a machine he created brought him in by mistake. Later, panic ensues after realizing that he didn’t finish the architecture or functions that allow a manual exit to be created. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >As he begins to meltdown, a sound emits from afar. This sound communicates with Cole, giving him hints on what to do. The sound gives Cole the feeling of “motive”, imploring him to go higher. Confused, he then received some vital information: He’s high in the sky, and that there IS, in fact, an exit at higher altitudes. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Now knowing there’s a chance to escape, he begins his journey to reach the exit. However, the further he goes, the more he realizes just how big his problems really are, and how his “Perspective” really changes things... </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Remember, </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >“Everything is not what it seems…”</p>",
