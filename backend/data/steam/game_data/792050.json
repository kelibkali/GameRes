    "description": "<i>A relaxing hiatus from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Sit in a remote corner of the world, drop a line, and see what bites.</i><br><br>Beneath the Surface is a short and relaxing fishing game. The gameplay involves simply dropping a line and waiting for a bite. You can upgrade your fishing rod to be quicker and your line to go deeper. The deeper you go, the more curious and delightful your catches get!<br><br>This is my first indie venture after working for some bigger studios. I've had practice making mods and fishing games in the past so I thought I'd put my experience toward something that could help me relax a little. I hope it helps you too!<br><br>Music by Kevin MacLeod.",
