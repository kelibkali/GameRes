Learn what the entertainment industry is all about and expand into new areas. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1530540/extras/d677ed1a3523986b5eac3031bda9b03e.poster.avif?t=1713259048\" width=616 height=180 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1530540/extras/d677ed1a3523986b5eac3031bda9b03e.webm?t=1713259048\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br>Buy a devastated resort and start your renovation with basic repairs, such as: cleaning, repainting walls, repairing utility elements of the building and much more. Watch your funds closely, make sure you plan your spendings wisely. Your limited budget won’t let you hire professional workers every time, sometimes you’ll have to handle some difficult repairs by yourself. Before you start repairing the electrical system make sure you read the instructions on how to connect the wires - safety first! Do as much work as possible by yourself in order to save money and gain vital experience as a real handyman.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1530540/extras/54a1bcb73e8e330cae73e88ac97b6c7d.poster.avif?t=1713259048\" width=616 height=180 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1530540/extras/54a1bcb73e8e330cae73e88ac97b6c7d.webm?t=1713259048\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br>When the first guests finally arrive at your resort, you won't be able to be everywhere at the same time. That’s the time when you’re gonna need to rely more on your staff. Check carefully qualifications and hourly rate of each employee you take onboard. A sophisticated hotel management system will let you monitor all the HR matters - if your employees are satisfied with their positions, when their contracts end, do they expect to get a pay raise? Pay close attention to your employees’ satisfaction, the competition is just waiting to poach your best people.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1530540/extras/12aa0a3dec4a3150e36b16bd45e66f0b.poster.avif?t=1713259048\" width=616 height=180 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1530540/extras/12aa0a3dec4a3150e36b16bd45e66f0b.webm?t=1713259048\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br>A nice room with direct access to the beach may not be enough to encourage tourists to choose your resort. You have to invest in a variety of attractions! How about... kayaks, motorboats, jet skis, wakeboarding, water bikes, windsurfing, sauna and many other water and beach activities you can offer to your guests in Lake Resort Flipper! Don’t forget to expand your indoor facilities as well. Offer your guests additional services of a masseur or a trainer and let them spend some time in one of your restaurants and bars.<br><br>Remember that Lake Resort Flipper is not only hard work but also heaps of fun! Enjoy the attractions offered by your resort - try motor boats or jet skis by yourself. Your business is your passion, so have fun!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1530540/extras/55634ea5097eaa07636a3a913e063d29.poster.avif?t=1713259048\" width=616 height=180 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1530540/extras/55634ea5097eaa07636a3a913e063d29.webm?t=1713259048\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br>The more money you earn, the more expansion opportunities will become available to you.
