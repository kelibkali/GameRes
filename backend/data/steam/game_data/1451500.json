    "description": "The Curse of Fafnir is a roguelike fantasy dungeon crawler that features things such as magic, mana, basic enemies, mini bosses, bosses, and a multi floor dungeon! You play as a rogue mage who tapped into dark arts to try and gain more power but as soon as you opened a dusty old book, Fafnir was summoned and not pleased, which caused him to place a curse on you and sent you to a eternal dungeon. To survive you must battle through all the floors until you make it to Fafnir so you can break the curse and return back to the overworld.",
