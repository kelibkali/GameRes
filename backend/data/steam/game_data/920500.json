    "description": "Construction Charlie tasks players with a simple goal: get to the elevator. This is accomplished by collecting items, defeating enemies, and jumping between platforms. Although the gameplay may feel familiar to fans of the casual platformer genre, Construction Charlie puts a modern twist on the genre, keeping even hardcore enthusiasts on their toes. Moreover, the fun doesn't stop after the main game is finished! A detailed level editor puts the developer's toolkit into <strong>your</strong> hands, allowing you to build and play whatever levels you can imagine!",
