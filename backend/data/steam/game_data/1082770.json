Certain needs apply certain effects, so when citizens eat food, they will regenerate a small amount of health, but left without any food, citizens will soon grow hungry and will start to lose health each time they miss a meal.<br><br>The <strong>economy </strong>is closely tight with the demands of citizens. If taxes out of balance with demands, citizens will grow unhappy much faster, at the same time gold is one of the main resources in the settlement and is needed to build defenses strong enough to stop barbarians from killing the king.<br><br>The <strong>science desk</strong> is not just a regular technology tree, it is more like real science, where certain technologies can be acquired just by lack, or with precise planning. Each day scientists will come up with a proposal of a number of science books they came up with and then it is up to the king, to decide which technologies are right for the settlement and invest science points. By acquiring 3 same science books, scientists will be able to further advance this exact technology by combining 3 same science books into 1 tier 2 science book. The same can be done with 3 tier 2 science books in order to receive 1 tier 3 science book. Though bookshelves are only limited to 10 active technologies, so planning settlement development strategy and investing in the right technology’s is the key to survival.<br><br>The <strong>industry </strong>is flexible and allows to build different workshops at any scale in order to produce goods necessary for the settlement.<br><br>Replenish the settlement treasury by <strong>trading </strong>exceeding goods to merchants or boost the production of goods by buying missing items.<br><br>In hostile medieval lands, the settlement is always in the danger of raids. Walls can be built to shield citizens from barbarian raids, but the army must take care of barbarians in the end. Barbarians are strong and fierce warriors so facing them in the field is always an option, though beating them with strategic planning will guarantee less loses. Different <strong>defensive structures</strong> such as ballista and traps can be built and luring barbarians to thoroughly prepared ambush probably will give an edge over them.<br><br> <br>The goal of <strong>Medieval Surviving</strong> is to survive for as long as it is possible.",
