    "description": "Play as the main character &quot;Stringy&quot; and his friends as they embark on a journey, traveling through multiple levels, and learning to use unique abilities to destroy the greatest evil the Stringverse has ever faced.. The Gold Eye Nebula. Little is known about this creature other than her deep desire to wipe out everything held within this Lunar lit realm.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStringtropy is a game in progress that utilizes some quantum physics themed abilities in order to enhance the typical experience of a bullet hell styled game. The game is primarily a game where you and the enemies will attempt to eliminate one another, but be careful. You may quickly come to find you are your own worst enemy as your primary attack will bounce an infinite amount of times until it may come back to bite you in the butt! Can you beat the level before you become more dangerous to yourself?",
