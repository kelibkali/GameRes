And you are invited to their favorite party of all time, King of the eggs! The festivities include: Beating eggs, beating friends and sick beats (Disclaimer: Not to  be confused with sick beets, Mr Alpaca Games does not endorse the consumption of disease ridden vegetables ). You’ll fight in a variety of stages, smashing the  competition and proving yourself a worthy successor to the throne.<br><br>Crack went the king’s shell when he fell off his throne. Now the nations of Eggorias have sent their strongest champions to fight for the right to rule the kingdom. A competition like no other this tournament features different trails to test the might of these eggs: “King of the hill”, “Survival”, and “Hotball”. Prove yourself in each of these challenges and be crowned the King of the Eggs!
