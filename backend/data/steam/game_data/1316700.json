Crafty players can complete the game in 30 minutes, but the average time is around 50 minutes.</i><br><br><strong>If this is a short game, what stops me from refunding after I finish it?</strong><br><i>As a gamer you understand the work that goes into creating these experiences, and are in principle up for paying for ones that entertain you. We hope that after escaping from Kyoto House you’ll feel good about the price you paid.</i><br><br><strong>Will there be more content?</strong><br><i>We will soon release a 'Horror Mode' which remixes the puzzles and greatly increases the difficulty, adding some terrifying new mechanics (and perhaps some evil spirits...) to the game. This mode will be free for people who own the game.<br><br>If Escape from Kyoto House proves to be popular, we really hope to release more escape experiences in the near future.</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Multiplayer co-op for up to 4 players</h2>Spend an evening with your friends exploring the mysteries of the Kyoto House.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1316700/extras/803bc2f2597e1b6878e156bca37de654.poster.avif?t=1741181876\" width=500 height=228 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1316700/extras/803bc2f2597e1b6878e156bca37de654.webm?t=1741181876\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1316700/extras/803bc2f2597e1b6878e156bca37de654.mp4?t=1741181876\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Discover the secrets of the Kyoto House</h2>Mysteries, riddles and more await you.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1316700/extras/9ed86549d3f8b991ae63cd363b771eb2.poster.avif?t=1741181876\" width=500 height=228 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1316700/extras/9ed86549d3f8b991ae63cd363b771eb2.webm?t=1741181876\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1316700/extras/9ed86549d3f8b991ae63cd363b771eb2.mp4?t=1741181876\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Over 20 different characters to choose from</h2>Pick from a big selection of characters.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1316700/extras/cb4ffcc3d43ba12130d587fb2243da00.poster.avif?t=1741181876\" width=500 height=228 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1316700/extras/cb4ffcc3d43ba12130d587fb2243da00.webm?t=1741181876\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1316700/extras/cb4ffcc3d43ba12130d587fb2243da00.mp4?t=1741181876\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Play now!</h2><strong>Grab some friends and Escape from Kyoto House!</strong>",
