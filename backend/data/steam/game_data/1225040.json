    "description": "You have just received a letter. Someone challenges you. You go to the indicated place and discover a painting gallery like no other...<br>Indeed, your challenge is to gather <strong>more than 200 paintings by solving puzzles!</strong><br><br>In <i><strong>A Mysterious Gallery</strong></i> you have to get paintings by solving three kinds of puzzles.<br><br>Most of the puzzles are inspired by <strong>hidden object</strong> games. Indeed, some paintings have a problem: <strong>an element has been erased</strong>. It's up to you to identify that element. For example:<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1225040/extras/f1707f83991d95ab3a5a92ef0b5724ed.avif?t=1745489845\" width=266 height=200 /></span> Pretty easy to guess what's missing! It's often less obvious. But <strong>there are always clues</strong>, just observe the painting carefully (position of the characters, pattern...).<br>Then, you have to find that element, because <strong>it is hidden among all the other paintings</strong>.<br><br>Then there are riddles with a <strong>code to find</strong>. The numbers or letters of the code are placed in the paintings. <strong>But they are invisible!</strong> You have to use a special object, the revealing magnifying glass. Its flash makes them appear.<br>Fortunately there are always <strong>clues</strong> to know in which paintings and in which places the numbers and letters are hidden.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1225040/extras/f707dd19a6089d411e0d3ab27a13979c.avif?t=1745489845\" width=200 height=200 /></span><br><br>Finally, there are <strong>more classic</strong> puzzles requiring action, memory, observation...<br><br>When a puzzle is solved, the paintings associated with that puzzle are added to the gallery and <strong>can be viewed freely</strong>. Most are in high definition.<br><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The controls are simple and may be suitable for casual players.<br></li><li>More than 200 paintings by real artists such as Degas, Rubens, van Gogh, Monet...<br></li><li>Discover works of art in an original way!</li></ul>",
