    "description": "Dark Deception Chapter 3 is the next chapter in the Dark Deception story. Face off against 2 new nightmares - Dread Duckies and the GremClowns. Dark Deception mixes the fast-paced style of classic arcade games with fun horror game design. Trapped in a dark world full of nightmarish mazes and ridiculous monsters, the only way out is to face the darkness and find a way to survive. <br><br><br>Features:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fast-paced Arcade Horror: No hiding in lockers here. Run for your life and run fast. Enemies can be stunned and avoided, but not killed. <br></li><li>Power System: Earn XP and unlock powers as you progress that will allow you to even the odds and survive longer against horrendous creatures. <br></li><li>High Quality: AAA-quality graphics and creative designs give players a variety of unique and terrifying worlds and enemies to survive. <br></li><li>Hazardous Environments: Enemies are not the only danger. The mazes themselves are full of traps, hazards, and other dangers to watch out for. <br></li><li>Unique Enemies: Every nightmare presents a unique creature that has its own distinct AI. Players will have to change up their tactics in order to survive. <br></li><li>Dark Humor: While scary, Dark Deception is not a bloody or gory game and features it's own stylized brand of dark humor. Dark Deception was designed to be enjoyed by everyone.</li></ul>",
