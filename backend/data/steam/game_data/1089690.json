In Zombie Mode, <br>it’s up to you whether you can survive and achieve a <strong>Highscore</strong>. <br>The Highscore can be improved every time. However, <br>it only stores when you die. If you go to the main menu or leave the game, <br>it will not be saved. In <strong>Training Mode</strong>, you can improve your skills. <br>In addition, you have a Highscore independent of the Zombie Mode, <br>which you can also improve again and again. You just have to be fast enough. <br>Of course, you have to be careful not to kill civilians. All opponents <br>in Training Mode are made of wood. In the <strong>Training Area</strong>, <br>it’s up to you how you want to improve. You also have a lot of freedom <br>and can try different things. <strong>Tutorial Mode</strong> teaches you the basics. <br>It is also a good start for <strong>Shooter Beginners</strong>.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1089690/extras/72fd9c55df045db8f957400edc876eda.poster.avif?t=1763734305\" width=600 height=128 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1089690/extras/72fd9c55df045db8f957400edc876eda.webm?t=1763734305\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1089690/extras/72fd9c55df045db8f957400edc876eda.mp4?t=1763734305\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><u><strong>Game Modes:</strong></u><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Zombie Modus<br></li><li>Training Area</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Training Mode</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Tutorial Mode</li></ul><br><br><strong><u>Zombie information:</u></strong><br><br>The zombies get <strong>stronger and faster</strong> with each wave. <br>They also drop <strong>random items</strong> that can be collected. <br>These items are immensely important to survive a <strong>high wave</strong>.<br><br><strong><u>Items:</u></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Money - [with the item you get money immediately]<br></li><li>Health - [replenishes your health to a certain percentage]<br></li><li>Max Amo - [refills your ammunition completely]<br></li><li>Instakill - [you will be put into a mode where you kill the zombies for a short time with a shot or a punch]<br></li><li>Nuclear Bomb - [kills all zombies while collecting the nuclear bomb for the current wave]</li></ul><br><br><strong><u>Mystery Crate Information:</u></strong><br><br>The <strong>Mystery-Crate</strong> is a crate that you can find in <strong>Zombie Mode</strong>. <br>At the crate you can buy a <strong>random weapon spin</strong> to get a primary or <br>secondary weapon.
