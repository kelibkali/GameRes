    "description": "In ancient mythological times, there was a king who had a beautiful daughter named Ariadne. Cruel god Hades wanted to marry her but she refused, and as punishment, he imprisoned Ariadne in a labyrinth guarded by a ferocious monster. Your goal as the hero is to descend into the maze and rescue the princess while staying clear of the Minotaur!<br><br><strong>Minotaur Maze </strong>is a simple action puzzle game about navigating a maze and avoiding a monster. Somewhere out there lurking (maybe just around the corner), The Minotaur is honing in on your location and hunting you down! With each level of the labyrinth, the difficulty increases because the maze gets larger and the Minotaur gets faster. Do you have the heroism to solve your way through <strong>Minotaur Maze</strong>?<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Maze-navigating action-puzzle challenge<br></li><li>3D pixel art and first-person camera<br></li><li>7 levels with increasing difficulty</li></ul>",
