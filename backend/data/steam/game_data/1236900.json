    "description": "Developer Note: In the interest of honesty I wanted to add this to the game description.  As of now Verdant Village is under reconstruction.  An engine change has been deemed necessary for the improvement of the game.  The current version on Steam is functional and all reviews posted are of the game in its current form.  This message is here to inform any potential buyers of what is going on with the game.  Currently any bugs that are found will be left.  When the new version is comparable to the live one it will replace the current live game.
