    "description": "Speedy Ferris is a nice 4x4, with the mission of testing rally tracks. For that, he will need you to assume the role of your Navigator in this adventure and be the mind behind the accelerator. It will be necessary to analyze the traces, observe obstacles, dangerous curves, straight lines and other deadly dangers to then position the action behaviors in strategic locations. With the job done it's time to give the green light so that Speedy can finish the lap as quickly as possible!",
