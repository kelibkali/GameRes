    "description": "Welcome to Outset.<br><br>Outset is a 2D platformer RPG being developed for PC and Mac. You control an Explorer, a wanderer tasked with searching the surrounding world and ideally finding something useful to bring back to your home - the village of NOTDON.<br><br>But how will you do that? With your GRAPPLING HOOK!<br><br><br>This stylish tool lets you speed across gaps and barrel through the world in a gameplay loop that combines fast-flowing platforming and nonlinear exploration. It'll even impress the other Explorers (for better or for worse) and make you the talk of the town, for the first time ever!<br><br>Along the way, you'll encounter ferocious foes, navigate the world, and maybe uncover some secrets about the world around you and your place in it.<br><br>...<br><br>Nah, of course you won't! It's just a game where you fight robots and try not to die! Just a fun, friendly, little game...<br><br>...right?<br><br><br>FEATURES:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Master your grappling hook and its slew of upgrades to discover new locations and secrets<br></li><li>Learn about the world around you through gameplay, new discoveries, and LOTS of (mostly optional) flavortext<br></li><li>Forge your own path... nonlinearly! Every dialogue choice and navigational decision will significantly change the story and the path forward.<br></li><li>Explore the 6 distinct regions of a massive, interconnected world (this is an indie game, though. It won't an AAA open-world game in 2D. But it will be big. But not that big. But still big. But not...)<br></li><li>Get hustled by no less than 2 very similar shopkeepers<br></li><li>Witness the evolution and impact of humanity firsthand (this means that major areas in the game will change and adapt based on the story)<br></li><li>Take a nap<br></li><li>And many more!</li></ul><br>On track for a release in early 2022... hopefully!<br><br>Made by Will Farhat<br>Programmed in GameMaker Studio 2",
