    "description": "Electro-Motive’s quintessential diesel switcher, in the classic form of the EMD SW1200 outfitted in stunning D&amp;RGW (Rio Grande) livery, comes to Train Simulator!<br><br>After offering customized diesel switcher models in the early 1930s, EMD hit its stride in 1939 with the 6-cylinder 600-horsepower SW1 (660 units built) and 12-cylinder 1,000-horsepower NW2 (1,143 units). Throughout the late 1940s and into the 1950s, EMD continued to update and refine its switcher models and, with the SW7 of 1949, Electro-Motive upped the horsepower of its 12-cylinder models to 1,200-horsepower. The SW9 of 1951 and SW1200 of 1954 continued the progression of 12-cylinder models while retaining the 1,200-hosepower rating.<br><br>Electro-Motive’s SW1200, which visually was nearly identical to its SW7 and SW9 predecessors, utilized the 567C version of EMD’s successful 12-cylinder power plant and enjoyed a production life extending from 1954 through 1966. Over those dozen years, more 70 buyers lined up to purchase 1,024 SW1200s which went to work throughout the Americas.<br> <br>Among the Class 1 railroad buyers of the SW1200 was the Rio Grande, which acquired ten units (D&amp;RGW 130-139) in December 1964 and January 1965. Dressed in the railroad’s flashy black and aspen gold livery, the SW1200s could be found working at notable locations on the D&amp;RGW, including Provo, Salt Lake City, and the famed Geneva Steel Works north of Provo. Rio Grande’s reliable SW1200s enjoyed successful service careers than spanned four decades, with the final units of the class not retired until the summer of 1998.<br>   <br>Created for Train Simulator by DTM, the SW1200 features realistic operating characteristics and details – and the SW1200 even allows users to customize a range of details, including exhaust stacks, cab sunshades, pilots, and handrails. And that’s not all! The D&amp;RGW SW1200 pack also includes a Rio Grande 50-foot insulated boxcar; 46-foot gondola (with multiple loads); 2-bay covered hopper – and Rio Grande’s handsome 01400-class caboose in six authentic liveries.<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Included Scenarios</h2><br>Four career scenarios featuring the D&amp;RGW EMD SW1200 on the Train Simulator Salt Lake City Route Extension (route available separately) are included:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>01-The Organizer<br></li><li>02-Collecting Goodies<br></li><li>03-Getting Ready<br></li><li>04-Working at Geneva</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
