They decided to take over the new world. While Anu was flaunting his power, Una was quietly creating the world, and after she filled the planet with lush, green islands and beautiful landscapes, she decided to create its inhabitants. She moulded various animals out of clay and left them in the sun to dry and mature so that she could give them a breath of life.While she was resting the mischievous Anu, out of jealousy, broke the clay figures into small pieces.  Now Una must put the fragments together to give each land its inhabitants.",
