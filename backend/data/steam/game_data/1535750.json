    "description": "BroodStar is a classic arcade shoot’em up with heavy roguelike elements. Careful, though... the vastness of space contains many formidable enemies. If you fall along the way, you have to start over — the only thing you’ll bring with you are the upgrade modules you collected in your past runs, in the form of research points that augment your ship. Will they be enough to get you through hordes of unknown creatures and monstrous bosses, and fulfill your quest of defeating the living planet — the BroodStar?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>12 Fully Randomized Stages<br></li><li>6 Main and 6 Sub Weapon Types<br></li><li>Over 160 Unique Upgrades<br></li><li>Research System<br></li><li>Seed System<br></li><li>Challenging Bosses and Boss Variations<br></li><li>Stage Modifiers and Events</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Stages</h2>There are 12 campaign stages, each with its own unique theme and enemy types.
