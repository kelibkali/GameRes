You are a repair robot sent to diagnose and fix utilitarian machines that were created to serve humans and automate tasks in dangerous locations. Careful planning and precise movements are required to complete each stage without falling. As the story begins to unravel you may discover that your role is not exactly what it seems...<br />\r\n<br />\r\n• Physical climbing controls that require you to look around often and be aware of your surroundings<br />\r\n• Physical running controls by swinging your arms (*not required to play - you can use simple trackpad locomotion if you prefer)<br />\r\n• Unique and beautifully detailed machines that animate to provide a dynamic and exciting climbing experience!",
