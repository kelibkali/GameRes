    "description": "A 54 page-long dive into the art of Gibbous - A Cthulhu Adventure, and how its world came to be.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures an in-depth look at the origins of the plot, the character, world building and lore of Gibbous. We take a look at what motivated the characters' visual designs, how the nature and architecture we grew up around can be traced inside the game's DNA, and how the overall aesthetic was influenced by our leit motif of &quot;warm and dark&quot;, that permeates the experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe strongly recommend you read this document after having completed the game, since it goes into very spoilery details, both plot and character-related.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe hope you'll enjoy a deeper dive into the mysterious, warm and dark world of Gibbous -  A Cthulhu Adventure!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can find the artbook in your Steam folder in: \\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Gibbous - A Cthulhu Adventure\\Artbook",
