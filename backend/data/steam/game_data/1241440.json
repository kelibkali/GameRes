This game is<br><br><strong>Not a difficult competitive action game<br>Not aimed at competing for wins or losses<br>A loose game that is gentle, gentle, and enjoys the cuteness and forgiveness of a good old adult to play like a 3-year-old child.</strong><br><br><br>There are only three basic rules in this game:<br><br><strong>1. Let's get along with many friends<br>2. Collaborate with your friends to collect a lot of treasure<br>3. If someone is crying or angry, comfort them.</strong><br><br>Yes, this game is a &quot;friendly world&quot;.<br><br>However, since this is a game, there are of course some elements of competition.<br><br>I will introduce it below.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1241440/extras/4748f386c2297d67b9b9fc4e00b8a1cd.avif?t=1727781467\" width=600 height=338 /></span><br><br>You are manipulating a creature called Elfin Clay made of magical clay.<br><br>They love collecting things.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1241440/extras/f99ed78770ac5c8318abba5a0d6d0c83.avif?t=1727781467\" width=600 height=338 /></span><br><br>However, they are too shy to carry things unless their faces are hidden.<br><br>Let's wear something on their heads.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1241440/extras/4f526f4dcde513c81329298d55355b57.avif?t=1727781467\" width=600 height=338 /></span><br><br>The game is a 3-on-3 team battle.<br><br>In 5 minutes, the team that collects a lot of items on the stage wins.<br><br>You collect items in toy boxes prepared for each team.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1241440/extras/2b232d5d778ad47aa7616b9ed2c19b6b.avif?t=1727781467\" width=600 height=338 /></span><br><br>When I looked up, the whale lifted the top of the toy box.<br><br>When the game is over, it will collect the item.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1241440/extras/1cf523cafd9056da5306139cc902811c.avif?t=1727781467\" width=600 height=338 /></span><br><br>Intercepting from the other team is one of the strategies...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Special actions that change with the hat</h2><br>Elfin Clays love to wear hats.<br><br>Depending on what they're wearing, they can perform special actions.<br>The charm of the game is that not all of the actions will give you an advantage in the game.<br>Some of the special actions are meaningful, some are not.<br> <br>It's okay if you don't win the game.
