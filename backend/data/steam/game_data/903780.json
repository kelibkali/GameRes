They claimed to be the ancient alien progenitors of the human race. They rode in on a Trojan Horse of advanced knowledge and a peaceful World Government. They were, to all who believed, the Saviors of the Earth and all mankind. The truth was that these tentacled abominations came from the bottomless depths of The Sea, chained up for thousands of years, and unshackled in these final days. <br> <br>They promised a new age of enlightenment and directed evolution, if only one accepted their authority and took their Mark. Those who refused were exiled to the island of Fleece, to live unhindered, yet disconnected from the rest of the &quot;enlightened&quot; world. By 2030 all the Earth was claimed. Now their army has come for Fleece. The remaining few Resisters are fighting to survive and ultimately escape the New World Order.               <br><br>                                                                                    <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/903780/extras/259823e255a8642d4c24b322f4fbe32d.poster.avif?t=1666986350\" width=500 height=124 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/903780/extras/259823e255a8642d4c24b322f4fbe32d.webm?t=1666986350\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/903780/extras/259823e255a8642d4c24b322f4fbe32d.mp4?t=1666986350\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>                                                                                <br><strong>Features:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tHack, sneak, and loot your way through procedurally generated cities! </li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tPurchase tons of skills you unlock by rescuing survivors!</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\t Perk system to complement the skill system that allows you to mix and match perks!</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tCrafting system that allows you to make what you need when you need it!</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tInteracting systems based gameplay allows you to think outside of the box to complete objectives!</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tChoose story mode or free play mode.
