Boons and Hexes are small unpredictable good and bad things that happen to players. Also has Wishes and three kinds of Spirits, all non-supply cards some cards can produce.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1581520/extras/74419cea0a0dac7654d1c2ea3e245d52.avif?t=1706777140\" width=600 height=224 /></span><br>If any Kingdom cards being used have an Heirloom banner, players start the game with that Heirloom instead of one Copper from their starting deck.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1581520/extras/587f9fb5015b6adf7eaad3c915d3c17d.avif?t=1706777140\" width=600 height=224 /></span><br>If any Kingdom cards being used have the Fate type, Boons are included as a non-supply pile. Boons are a face-down deck of cards that are revealed as needed.

In your Night phase, you can play any number of Night cards.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Flavor</h2><br><i>You’ve always been a night person; lately you’ve even considered becoming a vampire. There are a lot of advantages: you don’t age; you don’t have to see yourself in mirrors anymore; if someone asks you to do something, you can just turn into a bat, and then say, sorry, I’m a bat. <br><br>There are probably some downsides though. You always think of the statue in the town square, that came to life, and now works as the tavern barmaid. The pedestal came to life too, so she has to hop around. The village blacksmith turns into a wolf whenever there’s a full moon; when there’s a crescent moon, he turns into a chihuahua. That’s how this stuff goes sometimes. Still, when you breathe in the night air, you feel ready for anything.</i><br>-- Donald X.
