With our anti-wiki feature each save file you start will be different. Rather than looking up the best food to eat or which monster drops give the best potions, you will have to experiment in each save file to find the answer. A lot of these options are randomized so each new world will be different from the last. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >For example, in one world eating a burger might increase your max health, in another it might improve your mining speed. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Our aim with this mechanic is to make the game play less clinical and encourage you to play and experiment more with your world.
