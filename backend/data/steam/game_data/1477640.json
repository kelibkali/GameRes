    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Last Islands of Man is a retro rpg that will test your time management and efficiency. Every fight you make, every step you take, every nap you sneak, might cost you. The waters of the world are rising. Major countries and cities have been washed away by the steady advance. Now your small village of Akalabeth might be the last. Refugees are now as common as the monsters in the dungeons. The world is more dangerous and our time remaining is dwindling. Can you save yourself from the villains around you? Can you save your family from the strengthening monsters crawling out of the depths? </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The village of Akalabeth and the surrounding islands have been open to your exploration for years as you grew up. Instead of challenging the world you stayed close to home, playing with your friends, reading and not learning the skills needed to survive. You've ignored the perils facing the world, just as your parents have, and then one day it seems your mother has had enough ... </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><u>FEATURES:</u></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Story mode (few battles, 1 hr gameplay) </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Normal mode (challenging, 6-8 hr gameplay) <br>Active game time with a Timed challenge <br>Evolving and expanding maps <br>10 Classes with reactive team members <br>4 endings <br>500+ lines of written dialog <br>Male/female hero with 4 skins for each.  <br>Custom soundtrack from Monplaisir and John Bartmann  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Auto-Save and Achievements</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><u>STORY MODE</u></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Exploration, Puzzles, Quests and Friends!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Don't be aimless while you explore, the end of humanity still approaches.

Find what you can, take what you must. You might be the only hope.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><u>ACTIVE GAME TIME</u></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The end of the world approaches whether you stand against it or not. Every conversation you have, flower you pick, battle you face will advance you forward in time. Don't waste your time or lose everything.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><u>EVOLVING MAP</u></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Break through barriers, explore the waves, dig into the earth.

You can talk to many, but should you? Learn the Lore to save your future, or make your own by chance alone. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><u>HERO CUSTOMIZATION</u></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Sink yourself into the role of unlikely savior by choosing from 8 different skins.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><u>UNIQUE SOUNDTRACK</u></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Monplaisir's dirty guitar melodies braced with Bartmann's fuller orchestral efforts really push the experience of traveling the fields and digging through caves. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A game by T.C. Forsdike</p>",
