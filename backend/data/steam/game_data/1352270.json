She thinks the destination will be better.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a game about combining colors, creating a complex color from a set of simple ones.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a game about getting simple colors from things and bodies. The rabbit is only white on the outside, but it has a lot of red inside — the idea is clear.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther passengers don't always approve of the young Koshka's methods. They bother her with dialogues, filled with references to French theory, psychoanalysis, and other things that do not help our heroine's issue: if the rabbit keeps so much red in itself, how else can we get this magnificent paint? Apparently, there is only one solution.",
