    "description": "Turn-based role-playing game in a post-apocalyptic world. Cities have long been destroyed by nuclear explosions. Everywhere deserts and anarchy. The main character is a simple fragile girl. She got into trouble somewhere on the edge of civilization, but she miraculously survived and got the opportunity to join a small clan of Amazon women, where she would start becoming a fighter. After all, she has yet to return and complete an important task.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGAMEPLAY<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a turn-based game in 2.5D graphics. You can freely rotate the camera around you, but you can move around the world only in large steps at special points.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe rest is a classic role-playing game, inspired by the games Fallout, Wasteland, etc.",
