They have lived in the top half of the tower for generations, eating rats, nurturing trees for firewood, and fearing to stray from the traditions established by their ancestors.  The lower half, however... abandoned since long before anyone can remember.<br><br>Now, something in the lower half is failing.  Some spell or machine.  And the protections around the tower are starting to weaken.<br><br>Something in the lower half is also singing.  Horrible singing.  Drunken singing.  As if the throat were sawed open and the lungs torn apart...<br><br><i>Rats for Breakfast</i> is a surreal, narrative-driven, gameplay-fueled horror game from the developer of  DUSK, Fingerbones, The Moon Sliver, The Music Machine, and A Wolf in Autumn.  Interact with memorable characters, repair enchanted machinery, eat rats, and face whatever lurks below...",
