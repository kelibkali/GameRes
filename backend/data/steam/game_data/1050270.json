    "description": "A young office worker, tiring of an endless life of paperwork, dreams of taking a leap of faith into the shining city below. A god of old, forsaken for centuries, reawakens to a future of neon wonder and vending machines. Drawn together by a dream, the two of you search for adventure and home in the city. But the world is a daunting place -- rogue spirits roam the streets at night, and a certain company will demolish anything that is a nuisance to their vision. Yet maybe, for the two of you, and for anyone who truly seeks it out; adventure, unlikely friends, and a beautiful view awaits around every corner.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A coming-of-age story about curiosity, home, and finding beauty in the world<br></li><li>Action-packed combat system<br></li><li>Optional side quests with lasting impacts<br></li><li>(Approximately) 30+ unique mini bosses<br></li><li>👌 TIGHT 👌 platforming mechanics<br></li><li>Gates<br></li><li>Explore a gorgeous pixel art world<br></li><li>Lots of potato chips and vending machines  </li></ul><br><strong>A Message from Us</strong><br>Alight is our first game made with a lot of love, punted psets, and Double Chin. It’s a passion project that started as a spur-of-the-moment idea, but quickly grew into some much, much more than that. Everytime I see a new sight, or hear some new philosophy, all I think about is how it connects back to Alight. Working in between classes and across the country has been such a fantastic and hard time, but if you do something you love you’ll never work a day in your life. Especially if you do it with friends you love. Alight tells a story that we really can’t convey in anything else that a game, but it’s one that really does mean a lot to us. We hope our game inspires you to adventure, be curious, and draw lots of fanart. We’ve put our all into making a good-ass game, so we hope you’ll give us a shot as we develop Alight!!<br>-- Brickhouse",
