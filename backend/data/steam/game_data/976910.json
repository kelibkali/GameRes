    "description": "It is a demo for &quot;Brocat: the B Game&quot;.<br><br>Only one level is available. <br><br>---<br><br>Brocat, the main character, learns that he is a character in a side-scroller and that he was created by the Developer of this game. <br><br>Why? For what purposes? Was it really just to earn money?<br><br>The only way to find out is to reach the Developer who's avoiding publicity. The only thing known about him is the fact that he loves Internet culture, that's why he has protected himself with the created levels of the game and different nostalgic memes from the past. <br><br>Now Brocat knows that you control him, so you should finish all the locations that are the product of peculiar Developer's mind in order to figure out why the game was created. <br><br>Different weapons and their upgrades are there to assist you, as well as stuff to level up Brocat's skills and different bonuses on every level.<br><br>One more thing - a friend of a friend told me that if you collect 1 000 000 pyani, then a cartoon will be shown.<br><br>Features: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Side-scroller of “strong B” grade <br></li><li>Nostalgic memes<br></li><li>Internet culture setting<br></li><li>Carefully preserved bugs<br></li><li>It’s not 3D, and not 2D as well<br></li><li>The developer has neither the talent nor the money<br></li><li>The game was made with washed with soap hands<br></li><li>Millions of pixels on the screen and beyond it<br></li><li>Spirit and dust of old school <br></li><li>Script is dismal, just for the sake of appearance<br></li><li>Anyway, it’s nothing new</li></ul>",
