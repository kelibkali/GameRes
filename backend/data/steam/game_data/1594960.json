    "description": "Blast through robots, alien synthetics, and crazy interdimensional lifeforms to rescue the sacred gatekeeper (humanity's last hope), a super alien ethereal lifeform confined deep within the earth's core. A faithful sequel to the original 2015 Daydreamer reimagined with a new original storyline a 3D engine and of course, more cowbell.  Alternate gameplay modes between top-down classic tank shooter, and 3rd person hack and slash/shooter. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is still in a pre-alpha state but with big goals planned ahead including a vast interconnected world with some Metroidvania themes, cross-dimensional traveling with the classic young Olivia persona, a stylized toon variation of the game, and tons of twisted gory bosses.",
