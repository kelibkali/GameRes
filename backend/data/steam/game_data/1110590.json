    "description": "This DLC unearths a time capsule that may be of interest to fans of Little Square Things.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis &quot;Legacy Version&quot; of Little Square Things was very quietly released to the public in 2008. Here it is, released slightly more loudly!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's still a Sokoban-influenced title, and it's similar to the main game conceptually but differs in its execution. It has more of a web browser game / Flash-based aesthetic, more action-oriented controls, and a 3:4 aspect ratio (!). Many of the levels from Legacy have been ported to the main game, but many were scrapped. The Legacy Version has more content, though in terms of quantity over quality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main game is the definitive version, but fans may appreciate this relic for curiosity's sake -- and long-time fans may even remember it!",
