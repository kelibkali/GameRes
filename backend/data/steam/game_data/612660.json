    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >After global warming reshaped the Earth, flooding almost every continent, a handful of islands remain—one of them, a quiet corner of what was once Sweden.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You and your partner moved here to escape the noise of civilization, hoping for peace and simplicity. But no one warned you about the catastrophe unfolding across the world—an unstoppable crisis that changed the fate of every living being.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The few neighbors who once shared this island have vanished, venturing into the unknown in search of survivors. With no way to communicate, you can only wonder what they found… if they found anything at all.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Now, survival is all that matters. Scavenge for supplies, face the island’s unpredictable weather—from blistering summers to sudden freezing storms—and uncover the truth behind what remains of the world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >But one question lingers in the silence…<br><strong>Are we truly alone?</strong><br>And if not—how long until <i>they</i> find us?</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Stay up to date, follow the development of Just Us</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >It's available on Discord, Youtube, Twitter and Facebook</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Game Features</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >  <strong>Animal Breeding</strong><br>Capture and breed wild animals to build your own sustainable food source—or loyal companions.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Pet Companion</strong><br>You’re never truly alone.

Weather isn’t just visual—it directly affects your health, body temperature, and chances of survival. Stay dry, stay warm, and stay alive.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Crafting System</strong><br>Create everything you need to survive: tools, weapons, ammo, clothing, traps, and even building parts for your shelter.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Farming &amp; Greenhouses</strong><br>Grow your own crops, herbs, and medicine. Build greenhouses to protect your harvest from harsh weather and ensure your survival through winter.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Inventory System</strong> <br>Manage your resources carefully—every slot matters when survival depends on what you can carry.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Vehicles</strong><br>Find and repair abandoned vehicles to explore the island faster. Keep them fueled and maintained, or risk being stranded far from home.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Fishing</strong><br>Cast your line in the island’s lakes to catch food—but remember to cook it first. Raw fish might just send you to bed sick.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Cooking System</strong><br>Prepare meals, brew medicine, and discover recipes that boost your health and stamina.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Resource Gathering</strong><br>Chop down trees, mine stone, and collect herbs and seeds to craft tools, grow crops, and expand your base.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Weapons &amp; Combat</strong><br>Defend yourself with found rifles or craft your own.
