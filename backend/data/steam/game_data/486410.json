    "description": "Biosys Inc. is a biology aquarium where you can observe and assist your cells and bacteria to become complex beings. Starting with a single cell, you will cause the evolution of an entire ecosystem blooming with archaea, cyanobacteria, antibodies, eukaryotes, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Fight as viruses are born from random mutations and try to destroy everything you have built.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's a fun way to study biology!",
