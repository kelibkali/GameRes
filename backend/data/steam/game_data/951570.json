Screams can be heard in the distance, something unnatural drips nearby and an unsettling feeling sinks into your gut. You are alone, stuck in a wheelchair and with no way to defend yourself. What happened to this place? Why can’t you remember who you are or why you find yourself here? What happens next? That’s up for you to find out in Deadness. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/951570/extras/bb50bc038a61148672702d9952ee05a9.poster.avif?t=1738751348\" width=640 height=360 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/951570/extras/bb50bc038a61148672702d9952ee05a9.webm?t=1738751348\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/951570/extras/bb50bc038a61148672702d9952ee05a9.mp4?t=1738751348\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Deadness is a VR Horror Game that places you in a wheelchair and expects you to survive.
