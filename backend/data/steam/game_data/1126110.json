Would you prefer to build an impenetrable self-restoring defense? Would you set up some long-spanning plans to destroy the Opponent's base with your loyal soldiers? <strong>Up to you to decide!</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1126110/extras/0c6ffa548e2d552d55f1f9a9f867732d.poster.avif?t=1678917367\" width=568 height=320 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1126110/extras/0c6ffa548e2d552d55f1f9a9f867732d.webm?t=1678917367\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1126110/extras/0c6ffa548e2d552d55f1f9a9f867732d.mp4?t=1678917367\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Outsmart thy Opponent</h2><br>The towers you pick before the battle are kept secret until built on the field.<br><br>Turns are done simultaneously, so every turn brings an opportunity to force your Opponent to guess what kind of tower you will build this time.<br>This allows for plenty of unpleasant surprises and sudden ambushes. Is this work under construction a vicious attack or a bluff? Should I expect a risky move from my Opponent or assume he's as afraid of me as I am of him? <strong>Psychological warfare plays a significant role in Keep the Keep!</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Join us on Discord</h2><br>Keep the Keep is, at its core, a multiplayer game.
