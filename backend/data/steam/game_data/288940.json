    "description": "From the haunting strains of an old piano to the pulsing beats of a contemporary EDM party, The Charnel House Trilogy OST takes you on a journey through the lives of Alex Davenport and Harold Lang as they travel towards their fateful destination. With music inspired by iconic horror score and classical opera, this tour de force from a team of talented video game musicians is a perfect companion to The Charnel House Trilogy.<br><br><strong>Jack de Quidt</strong><br>Jack de Quidt is not only an exceptionally talented musician, but also one half of the game dev duo The Tall Trees, alongside Dan Pearce. His soundtrack to Sepulchre, which appears on and off throughout The Charnel House Trilogy, has received numerous praise, with the main theme in particular becoming a crowd favorite.  <br><br><br><strong>Bryan Henderson &amp; Callum Stevenson</strong><br>Bryan is a Computer Arts &amp; Design student, and his role in scoring Inhale and Exhale will be his first foray into the world of composing for video games. That's not to say he's a stranger to the gaming industry, however - if Bryan's name is familiar, it's because he's also known as the God of Gods; the winner of Peter Molyneux's Curiosity app, and the future ruler of Godus. <br><br>Callum Stevenson is Bryan's mysterious recording partner, of whom absolutely nothing is known except for his fantastic musical skills. He probably wears a mask.<br><br><br><strong>Gavin Harrison</strong><br>Gavin Harrison is a composer for games, film and TV, and has provided music for almost every good indie game you've ever played in the last three years. Maybe. He's done a LOT, anyway. And it is great. Now he's doing something for The Charnel House Trilogy, which is also great. <br><br><br><strong>nervous_testpilot</strong><br>Paul Kilduff-Taylor, aka nervous_testpilot, aka one half of Mode 7, is a known industry troublemaker with a history of releasing both music and video games. As nervous_testpilot, Paul's EP 'Steel &amp; Glass' features in The Charnel House Trilogy, because Alex is canonically a fangirl of both British EDM and Paul himself. <br><br><br><strong>Pavel Ulyanov</strong><br>As the brother of Charnel House Trilogy co-creator Ivan, Pavel is a mysterious musician who descends upon the offices of Owl Cave when needed, ready to lay down a beat or provide some audio direction. If Batman could play guitar, he'd be Pavel.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Track List</h2><br><strong>Gloria’s Final Ride</strong> - 03:41<br>Performed by Gavin Harrison<br><br><strong>The Days Are Endless</strong> - 03:51<br>Performed by Bryan Henderson and Callum Stevenson<br><br><strong>Snow Covers Ice</strong> - 03:26<br>Performed by Bryan Henderson and Callum Stevenson<br><br><strong>Darling Dreams</strong> - 02:24<br>Performed by Jack de Quidt<br><br><strong>Unearthing the Truth</strong> - 00:33<br>Performed by Jack de Quidt<br><br><strong>The Key Copied Midnight</strong> - 03:02<br>Performed by Jack de Quidt<br><br><strong>Man in a Burial Shroud</strong> - 02:14<br>Performed by Jack de Quidt<br><br><strong>Down Among The Worms</strong> - 01:39<br>Performed by Jack de Quidt<br><br><strong>Lydia Lost </strong>- 02:49<br>Performed by Jack de Quidt<br><br><strong>Raven, Blackbird, Seagull, Swan</strong> - 03:10<br>Performed by Jack de Quidt<br><br><strong>Noisemaker</strong> - 04:18<br>Performed by nervous_testpilot<br><br><strong>Steel and Glass</strong> - 04:15<br>Performed by nervous_testpilot<br><br><strong>Details</strong> - 03:52<br>Performed by nervous_testpilot<br><br><strong>Forever</strong> - 05:20<br>Performed by nervous_testpilot<br><br><strong>A Single Grain of Dirt</strong> - 02:36<br>Performed by Bryan Henderson and Callum Stevenson<br><br><strong>Rooms Without Views</strong> - 03:30<br>Performed by Bryan Henderson and Callum Stevenson<br><br><strong>Rebirth of the Author</strong> - 02:19<br>Performed by Pavel Ulyanov<br><br><strong>The Earth Crawls</strong> - 02:38<br>Performed by Gavin Harrison<br><br><strong>A Single Grain (Unearthed Mix)</strong> - 02:04<br>Performed by Bryan Henderson and Callum Stevenson<br><br><strong>Rooms Without Views (Open Door Mix)</strong> - 03:30<br>Performed by Bryan Henderson and Callum Stevenson<br><br><strong>Rooms Without Views (Shutters Down Mix)</strong> - 03:30<br>Performed by Bryan Henderson and Callum Stevenson<br><br><i>To view the soundtrack, right click on The Charnel House Trilogy in your game list, go to &quot;properties&quot;, go to the &quot;local files&quot; tab, and click &quot;browse local files&quot;.
