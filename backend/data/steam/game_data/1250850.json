The place quickly became notorious. Ominous sounds are often heard from there and carcasses of animals found in the vicinity. People talk about spirits and poltergeists and bypass the building. <br><br>A letter was attached to the thick diary envelope asking him to save the soul of the granddaughter, possessed by a demon. The hero would have treated this letter as delirium of a crazy old woman, if not for a diary with evidence that the girl and her friends performed a mystical ritual. Intrigued by this story, the hero undertakes to investigate the mysterious events of the past.<br><br>In search of truth, you as a practicing medium have to to explore the school to demystify what happed there. Use your mystical sight and enchanted artifacts to look into the other world for answers.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1250850/extras/336440a1ca8534d69970ab20ffb22dcb.avif?t=1704527662\" width=600 height=130 /></span><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Strange twists and turns will leave you uncertain<br></li><li>Explore the depths of madness within abandoned school<br></li><li>Put puzzles to solve a main riddle</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1250850/extras/ded7a64e754fa736d43ad117c21d7607.avif?t=1704527662\" width=600 height=130 /></span><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Explore the environment to uncover the details of the tragic past<br></li><li>Uncover hiding details using your spiritual powers<br></li><li>Search through the abandoned school and see the story and secrets unfold</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1250850/extras/7ab4771fb3fd9dbc1f31954d2514eb9b.avif?t=1704527662\" width=600 height=130 /></span><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Hallucinating and delirious vision appers around<br></li><li>Despite of the paranormal basis of surroundings - your and your decisions are real<br></li><li>Each event affect further story and endings</li></ul>",
