    "description": "Deflection Dimension is a 2D, rogue-lite dungeon crawler with puzzle elements. You'll play as Tim, who finds himself lost in another dimension without any tools or weapons. Make use of the magical entity, Speculo to bounce bullets back at your enemies. Together, you’ll fight through countless monsters, bust your way out of the dimension, and get Tim home in time for tea.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>Gameplay</u><br>If you think this game is a simple Dungeon Crawler…..you’re very wrong. It’s not as straightforward as pointing Speculo at enemies and standing there. Everything in this Dimension is out to get you, which is why you have the dash; it’s your life-saver.<br></li><li><u>Leaderboard</u><br>See where you place on our leaderboard, comparing your scores to other players all around the world.<br></li><li><u>Dungeons</u><br>The dungeons are made up of procedurally generated rooms and floors so you never have to play the same run twice.….Unless you want to. We’re adding seeds so you can share the same run with your friends &amp; challenge them to beat your score.<br></li><li><u>Enemies</u><br>Our enemies all have unique attack types and styles. You’ll face tougher enemies as you progress, each one with a different way to kill you.<br></li><li><u>Bosses</u><br>You’ll encounter bosses of each world, who’ll face you with special attacks that even Speculo can’t protect you from!<br></li><li><u>Powerups</u><br>A diverse range of powerups to change up the pace and explore different ways to defeat the monsters. There are powerups of various tiers that all affect Tim, Speculo, and the gameplay in different ways.<br></li><li><u>Worlds</u><br>Each world has its own theme. Traverse the landscapes while solving puzzles, but be wary of the traps and monsters that lie within. In Early Access, we currently have 2 worlds, but are hoping to get 4 worlds in the full release of the game.</li></ul>",
