When they did not forgive mistakes and controls and rules were clear and simple to learn? YES? So you miss the 90s! Then prepare to travel back in time. As a cosmic marine Red Madson shoot, jump and kill the aliens who were so stupid to attack your base. Find the exit in 14 wide levels and get back to Earth.<br><br><strong>Too Angry To Space</strong> encourages you to sit back, relax and get ready for some classic 2D side-scrolling action reinvented and reimagined! With its clever blend of platforming trickery and old-school pixel-perfect jump’n’fun, lock-and-load and embark on a dangerous mission to defend your base… Mission objective: kill robots, destroy enemies, kill more robots, survive and escape! Here you will find pure action without a post-rpg bullshit like leveling the hero or sneaking around. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/494990/extras/8e5df5f267638a5b9da636c8df9b55b6.avif?t=1569078941\" width=600 height=150 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Simple controls </strong>which allow you to play with just one hand. In the second one you can hold a beer (or soda if you are a minor). <br></li><li><strong>Level of difficulty which requires skill</strong> but allows you to acquire them as the game goes on. You don’t have to remember to save your progress – the game does it for you, but if you die too many times, you will be punished. <br></li><li><strong>100% oldschool from 90s</strong> in graphics and also in gameplay. <br></li><li><strong>160 different rooms </strong>on 14 levels. <br></li><li><strong>4 types of weapons</strong> with 2 modes of use. <br></li><li><strong>Parental controls</strong> - you can turn off the profanities and give this game to your children if you want.</li></ul>",
