These factions may be used in Single or Multiplayer Campaign modes and Custom and Multiplayer battles.<br><br>With the Viking Forefathers at their command, players can marshal the forces of The Geats, The Jutes and The Danes as they launch southwards from their icy homelands on campaigns of looting, raiding and conquest. In the bitter, windswept north, hard winters breed hard men, and Norse warriors are redoubtable in combat on land and sea. To these natural seafarers and expert coastal raiders, the plentiful lands to the south promise glorious victories and great plunder!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/335020/extras/64f22d24489142c0d4e65eee3a7c31e6.avif?t=1763649049\" width=628 height=180 /></span><br><br><strong>Unique Cultural traits</strong><br>All Norse factions share the Viking Raiders trait, making them expert profiteers from raiding, looting and sacking.<br><br><br><strong>Unique Faction Traits</strong><br>All Norse factions bear a unique trait which further defines their strengths and play-style in the Grand Campaign.<br><br><u>The Danes: Seaborn</u><br>Immune to both high-seas attrition and seasickness, The Danes are able to weather the worst maritime conditions and make full use of their land units in naval conflict.<br><br><u>The Geats: Cold Blood</u><br>The hardy Geats are raised in icy climates.

As the most southerly of the Norse kingdoms, they came into contact with the southern European peoples early on, treating them with an uncharacteristic openness. <br><br>After this, many left their lands to seek their fortunes elsewhere, returning with more than just gold. One recognised the potential of the Roman alphabet, adopting it to suit his native tongue and the writing materials available in the north. This led to the creation of the first runic alphabet, which rapidly spread across northern Europe, greatly enhancing the Nordic peoples’ culture and trade, resulting in the creation of objects combining both exotic resources and traditional Nordic styles.<br><br>However, neither wealth nor culture has dampened the Dani’s desire for conquest. Many northern tribes plunder foreign shores yet neglect their own; not so the Dani. Poised to take advantage of the ensuing upheaval, they strive to forge a grand Nordic empire to outlast that of Rome!<br><br><u>The Geats</u><br>Legendary ancestors of Beowulf, the Geati manifest all the intrepid boldness of the famous hero. From their stronghold on the southern tip of the Swedish peninsula they have naval access to the whole of northern Europe, allowing them to launch frequent raids without fear of retribution. The most glorious of these exploits are told in the Geati’s rich oral tradition, immortalising their leaders and inspiring a new generation to seek glory.<br><br>While the arrival of the Huns in Europe has meant disaster for most, for the Geati it is just another opportunity. Recently their king, Gizur, led a force into central Europe to fight alongside the Goths in exchange for Roman gold and goods – there are rich pickings to be gained fighting for the highest bidder in the south. Crisis is blooming in these fertile lands, and the Geati are determined to be at its heart, profiting from it.<br><br><u>The Jutes</u><br>The ocean laps the coasts of Juteland, summoning its inhabitants to new adventures and conquests. As such, the Juti have always been the most intrepid of the Norse-speaking peoples, looking to distant shores or clashing over the sparse northern lands. Accordingly, they are in the perfect position to profit from the slow collapse of Roman Britannia, and relentlessly plunder its coast as its defenders dwindle in number.<br><br>The Juti leadership use the spoils of their raids to make exquisite, prestige goods. Should the Juti succeed in conquering Britannia, many more will no doubt be forged. A successful conquest would be a great undertaking, and one requiring them to draw on the very depths of their fortitude. <br><br>To drive out the remaining Romans, subdue the belligerent locals, and foil the ambitions of their Saxon neighbours who also covet this green and pleasant land – the Juti have vowed no less!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/335020/extras/1c2b6422b439a94c600be26e6e2e72c4.avif?t=1763649049\" width=628 height=180 /></span>",
