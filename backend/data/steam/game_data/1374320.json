    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Regeneration</strong> is a slow-paced psychological horror focused on tension, uncertainty, and exploration.<br>After surviving a helicopter crash in an isolated anomalous wilderness, a scientist tries to save someone deeply important to him. Cut off from the outside world, guided by broken memories and distorted voices, he begins to notice that the environment around him no longer behaves consistently.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Locations subtly change, events contradict each other, and the world feels wrong. What starts as a rescue mission slowly turns into a descent, as the line between reality and hallucination, the self and something alien, begins to blur. It gradually becomes unclear who truly needs saving.   </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Unreliable Reality</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The world reacts to the protagonist’s deteriorating perception. Environments shift, memories become unreliable, and progression is shaped by uncertainty rather than clearly defined rules.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Scientific tools</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Progression is built around exploration and investigation. Scientific tools are used to observe anomalies, gather information, and interact with the environment, not to engage in direct combat.  </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>A Gradual Descent</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The story unfolds through exploration, environmental details, and fragmented communication. The narrative develops slowly, without clear answers, encouraging players to question what is real.  </p>",
