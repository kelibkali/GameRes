See that little cross at the top right corner? That’s what you can drag around the X/Y\tpad and changes the timbre of the piano.<br><br>Dragging it vertically,\twill change the tone of the piano, making it thinner the lower you go. Dragging it horizontally, you will add distortion.\tYou can also, of\tcourse, combine the two and place the cross anywhere on the x/y pad.",
