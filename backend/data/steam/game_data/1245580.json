Stay tuned…<br><br>Story begin at the island, famous for its fishing harbor and whaling. <br>One night, main character become drunk and decide, to take advantage of the breeze and sail out on boat.<br>What happened in those lost chapters?<br>Violent storm. Returning to whaling ship. Find hideout in the ship.<br>Few parts are lost and it’s not sure if author will find them:<br>-letter written in blood attached to the dog, warning to remain hidden, as his life depends on it.<br>-mysterious message, as well as a mutiny had erupted on the whaling ship. <br>Crew was slaughtered by the mutineers.<br>Main character dressed in the clothes of a recently dead sailor, masquerading as a ghost.<br>In the confusion sure to break out among the superstitious sailors, ship is taken over again. <br>All the mutineers are killed or thrown overboard.<br>We don’t know about these things yet. That material is also lost.<br>The storm increases in force, breaking the mast, tearing the sails and flooding the hold.<br>It was safe for a moment, but without provisions. Over the following days, the men face death by starvation and thirst.<br>Dutch ship passed and he was horrified as he overcome with an awful stench. <br>He soon realized that the apparently cheerful sailor at the ship was, in fact, a corpse propped up in the ship's rigging, his &quot;grin&quot; a result of his partially decomposed skull moving as a seagull feed upon it. As the ship passes, it became clear that all its occupants are rotting corpses.<br>There was sign: one of them should be killed as food for the others. <br>Some parts of the story you will recognize, other will stay mystery because that material is gone… <br>You are close to death when you reach the Jane Guy, a ship out of Liverpool.<br>Sharks will hunt you. <br>You’ll study the island around, become interested in the structures and atmosphere. You’ll need to go farther south towards the unexplored region.<br>An ice and open sea, with a mild climate will look like you’re at the end of the world. <br>Mysterious island called Tsalal, inhabited by a tribe of black, apparently friendly natives led by a chief. The color white is alien to the island's inhabitants and unnerves them, because nothing of that color exists there. Even the natives' teeth are black. The island is also home to many undiscovered species of flora and fauna. Its water is also different from water elsewhere, being strangely thick and exhibiting multicolored veins.<br>Watch on the ambush in a narrow gorge. <br>You could hide in the mountains surrounding the site of the ambush but you’ll be teleported to some weird town where you need to discover a labyrinth of passages with strange marks on the walls, and disagree about whether these are the result of artificial or natural causes. <br>Only escape, only truth! Here the story ends abruptly. <br>What happened next?<br>After several days main character encounters a rain of ashes and then observe a huge cataract of fog or mist, which splits open to accommodate their entrance upon approach. The native dies as a huge shrouded white figure appears before them.<br>A short post-scriptural note, ostensibly written by the project editors, explains that main character was killed in an accident and speculates his final two or three chapters were lost with him, though assuring the public the chapters will be restored to the text if found. The note further explains that he is alive in but cannot be interviewed at present. The editors then compare the shapes of the labyrinth and the wall marks noted to Arabian and Egyptian letters and hieroglyphs with meanings of the &quot;White Wizard&quot;.",
