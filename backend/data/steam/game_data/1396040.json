    "description": "The <strong>Nightvision: Drive Forever Original Soundtrack</strong> lets you take your mind off the road and just listen to the great tunes from the game inspired by chillwave, electropop, futurebass, indietronica, and even chiptunes genres. The album was recorded at aquabox Studios and features a range of analog and digital synths, guitars, bass, rhodes piano, orchestral sounds (and much weirder) somehow all coalescing into something you can't stop tapping your foot to... preferably while it's on an accelerator.",
