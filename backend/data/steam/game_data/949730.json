Your task is to navigate rings, excavate minerals, and sell the ore at the Enceladus station. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/949730/extras/f7ca166dc391e0a3ba5f833bed62f378.poster.avif?t=1735640759\" width=600 height=250 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/949730/extras/f7ca166dc391e0a3ba5f833bed62f378.webm?t=1735640759\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>You can hire and manage your crew who will aid you, update your ship - or switch to a completely new one. You can acquire a bounty hunter licence, explore mysteries or smuggle weapons - but at the core, you are a rock-hopper and rock-hopping is what you’ll spend most of your time at. And since it is the core of this game, we made sure you’ll have a great time flying your ship and excavating.<br><br>You are no chosen one, the story does not revolve around you -  it is driven by the characters you hire and encounter, and each playthrough will play out differently. You can choose to investigate and embrace their lives, or just ignore them. It’s all up to you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Giving Science its Due</h2><br>Tired of having more Fiction than Science? Here you will find lasers are not visible without a medium, sound does not move through the void of the empty space and every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Thrusters eject gas that heats up and pushes away objects, your reactor is cooled by propellant flowing through it and radiators glow when you pump heat into them.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/949730/extras/c842253d6f64d35928416598eb03d908.poster.avif?t=1735640759\" width=600 height=250 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/949730/extras/c842253d6f64d35928416598eb03d908.webm?t=1735640759\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>There are no energy shields, teleporters and Heisenberg compensators. No lightspeed, no blasters, and no artificial gravity. Instead, we have fission reactors, thermal rockets, ion thrusters and centrifugal gravity. You'll have hard decisions to make, with no &quot;best&quot; equipment to answer every need.<br><br>All technologies are real and there is no technobabble. But it’s still a game and one that is fun to play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Weekly Updates</h2><br>ΔV is in active development, with new stable updates coming out each week, and experimental ones getting pushed out daily. Many ideas you’ll find in the game come from players and it is not uncommon to suggest something on our discord - and see it in the game next week. Our player community consists of enthusiasts geeks, engineering and science-fiction nerds, and if that sounds like your kind of crowd - come to our discord, chat with us, and see how the game unfolds in real-time.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/949730/extras/d7ac0e5da0f96c7a8bc4dc09ad982c23.poster.avif?t=1735640759\" width=600 height=250 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/949730/extras/d7ac0e5da0f96c7a8bc4dc09ad982c23.webm?t=1735640759\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>The event-driven nature of our storytelling means that we can expand our stories and enrich your experience seamlessly - while you are still playing.

It includes a subtle watermark that is not obtrusive. Progress and achievements seamlessly transfer to the full version, which also unlocks access to free and paid DLCs. The demo is a great way to explore the game before upgrading.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>No time or content restrictions.<br></li><li>Includes a subtle watermark.<br></li><li>Progress and achievements transfer to the full version.<br></li><li>Full game unlocks access to free and paid DLCs.<br></li><li>Steam achievements available in the full game.</li></ul>",
