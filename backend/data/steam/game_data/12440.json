    "description": "&lt;p&gt;This time he will not fail. This time Osiris will show the world of humans what he's made of. But the ankh alone is not enough - not as long as he hasn't found the most important part of his body: his heart.&lt;/p&gt;<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;p&gt;Life has not been kind to Assil. Only three weeks ago he managed to ward off his death curse. Since then a relationship (with Thara) has hit the rocks and the Ankh was stolen from him (by sinister assassins). Assil sets out to get it all back.&lt;/p&gt;<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;p&gt;He is not the only victim, however - there is another: the pharaoh! One moment he sits on his throne, lazy, sluggish and with a heck of a hangover, the next he is a slave in his own quarry - how could this have happened? And more importantly: how is he going to get out of this without getting killed?&lt;/p&gt;<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;p&gt;Ankh: Heart Of Osiris is even more intense and more bizarre as it takes the player even deeper into the lazy world of old Cairo. You'll meet a lot of familiar faces, but there are plenty of new surprises and the same black humor found in the first Ankh.&lt;/p&gt;",
