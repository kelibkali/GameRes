There are 8 voodoo Loa you can unlock.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Voodoo Pins are very important. They provide unique bonuses that will help you in the game.

The number of pins you can select at the same time will increase as you progress in the adventure.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>In this menu you can also level up your character once you have enough experience.

Dying is not an end, and rather only a means of becoming a stronger voodoo soul! Being a practitioner of voodoo has nourished your soul with immortality. As such, any gold and experience you earn will persist with your character through death itself. Use this gold and experience earned to buy new pins and the favor of Loa to progress through even harder challenges!</li></ul></li></ul>",
