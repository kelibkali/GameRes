    "description": "Take control of a test subject tasked with testing out a new device capable of shrinking and enlarging the user. You will be tasked with completing tests, all designed around the tester's height and weight. Platform, collect keycards, and fit through small gaps in this short single-player experience.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><br>You can make yourself larger and smaller with a simple press of a button. With this, you will be able to fit through small openings. However, your size affects your weight, so you must keep that in mind as you might encounter a pressure plate that will take your weight into account. Additionally, your weight determines your speed, letting you jump over large gaps or run through doors before they close.<br><br>As you solve puzzles, the Overseer will observe your performance and talk to you as you play. You will get to know him, and the difficulties he faces at the facility.",
