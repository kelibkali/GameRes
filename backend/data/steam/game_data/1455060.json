    "description": "TERMINUS presents a quest, a choose-your-own adventure into a mysterious universe of alien architecture populated by humanoid clones and cryptic symbols.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrepare yourself for a slippage of time and space into five distinct realms: cross the frontier through Fleshold Crossing; take respite in Known Unknown; lose yourself within Scumm Engine; face impending danger in the tower of Gog &amp; Magog; and experience the brink of sensory overload in the psychedelic Tumblewych. The mysteries of what you ultimately seek will be revealed: an understanding that reality is not fixed but rather both malleable and multiple.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;If you enjoy lucid dreaming and long for some virtual unreality your cup will truly runneth over.&quot; Richard O'Brien (Rocky Horror Show)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA thirty minute VR exploration of the arcane world illustrated in the drawings of Jess Johnson, brought to life by Simon Ward, developer Kenny Smith and soundtracks by Andrew Clarke.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCommissioned by the National Gallery of Australia with the assistance of The Balnaves Foundation",
