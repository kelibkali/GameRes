Choose your class and specialization for a set of loyal guild officers you create who will follow your every command, no matter the danger. With a realm full of eager potential heroes making their own logical AI driven decisions, recruit those which stand out to you into your guild and provide for them. In return, you will earn their loyalty as they assist your guild officers in the group dungeons and raids with party sizes of up to 40 heroes. Deploy your might to help restore peace to the world and provide aid to protecting the ancient and powerful Earthstone.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2051640/extras/621308d21d9a6ca5a06bb8ff6d59fb28.poster.avif?t=1739221896\" width=600 height=224 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2051640/extras/621308d21d9a6ca5a06bb8ff6d59fb28.webm?t=1739221896\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2051640/extras/621308d21d9a6ca5a06bb8ff6d59fb28.mp4?t=1739221896\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><strong>Grow Your Realm</strong><br>It’s not just your guild that needs help. Engage in trade routes between the smaller towns and larger cities outside of your own. Create an economy of powerful gear and crafting materials to aid the world heroes on their own quests and adventures, while posting quests that the heroes will take upon themselves to complete for you. Engage in deep strategy by posting the right quests at the right times to help push the world heroes in the right direction of obtaining more experience and gear to grow along with your own officers. Upgrade gathering nodes and your quest log, rank up the dungeons of the world to better reward any hero powerful enough to come out alive.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2051640/extras/a2c49d52be8972f41166d5c82bef14d2.poster.avif?t=1739221896\" width=600 height=224 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2051640/extras/a2c49d52be8972f41166d5c82bef14d2.webm?t=1739221896\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2051640/extras/a2c49d52be8972f41166d5c82bef14d2.mp4?t=1739221896\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><strong>Empower Your Heroes</strong><br>Collect various materials you can use to forge powerful gear for the heroes of the realm. Hunt monsters in the world or delve deep into the perilous dungeons. Emerge victorious and claim the spoils of each new battle you face. Beware, as death is permanent in this Realm. Each death has consequences within the Realm, but the deeds of the fallen aid in empowering the realm and will serve to benefit the future heroes to come so long as you do your part.",
