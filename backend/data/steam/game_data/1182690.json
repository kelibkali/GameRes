As long as you are alive nothing else matters? No one else matters?<br><br>Do you accept to be just a pawn working for low life scums? Or will you rise and turn into everyone's hero. Or worst nightmare...<br><br>Choose wisely(or not) because every choice you make affects how people think about you and how your story will end. <br><br>Protect or bully people, have a good time with a &quot;street girl&quot;, get robbed, deal with totally random events, hack old tech, pick locks, take a bath(or not).<br><br>In this game choices really matter, you can recruit some mercenaries or even ghosts to fight for you. <br><br>There are 4 different characters each one with their own unique abilities and stories. <br><br>Over 25 endings based on which character you use and your choices",
