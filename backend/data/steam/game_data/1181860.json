It includes:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>8 fully-furnished Horror Mansion maps<br></li><li>9 cobwebbed, rotting Tower ruins (compatible with the tower in Arcane Augurum)<br></li><li>8 unfurnished blank Mansion templates.</li></ul>Maps are sized specially for FG at 1350x900 and under 500 kb each to help prevent slow-down during play. DM Convenience is the focus with carefully labelled maps and several ways to access, use and choose the maps in this module. Use the VISUAL MAP SELECTION PANEL and pick your map from the thumbnails and yellow label by clicking on the pin. Or use the RANDOM ROLL TABLES to pick your destination at random.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong></strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and any ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
