    "description": "The Shortz &amp; Kerl Railroad was an electrified short line that began freight services in the early part of the Twentieth Century, linking Port Shortz with the Kerl Iron Works.<br><br>The railroad expanded and prospered over several decades as numerous industries established themselves around the port and the iron works. Like many other traction lines in North America, the railroad closed in the late 1960s.<br><br>This Model Trainz layout represents the Shortz &amp; Kerl in its hayday. On the layout there are many interactive industries. Many of these industries are interdependent. For example, logs arriving at the Port are sorted at the Dry Sort Yard, which then supplies logs to a timber mill that supplies lumber to a crate manufacturer that, in turn, supplies wooden crates to several industries. The Farmall Tractor Company requires steel from the Kerl works and components from local industries.<br><br>In addition, a Class 1 railroad drops off and picks up freight cars in the Transfer Track as well as a small locomotive depot and a MoW yard.<br><br>Route Creator: philskene<br><br>Sessions:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Gondola Shuffle<br></li><li>Oiling the Wheels<br></li><li>The Coal Run</li></ul><br>Content:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Loco Boxcab Electric<br></li><li>Loco kDB EB03 Traction Railroad<br></li><li>Loco Tem II Knuckle Couplers<br></li><li>ATSF GP60M<br></li><li>ATSF SD45<br></li><li>SP SD45<br></li><li>Rolling Stock = 9 vehicles<br></li><li>Over 200 additional scenery assets</li></ul>",
