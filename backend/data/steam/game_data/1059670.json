Yudai Sayashi’s ragtag club of “treasure hunters” known as Durchhalten faces tragedy, as Yu's sister Miho carelessly triggers a trap that kills her.<br><br>Two years later, Yu comes across a startling discovery. The mythical Noah’s Ark, borne of legend by those who believe the Old World can be restored, turns out to be real. <br><br>Yu learns about the existence of the Lazarus Protocol inside Noah's Ark – a system that can recreate anything from the past – and goes on a search for the Ark, believing Miho can be brought back to life. <br><br>Before setting out to find the Ark, however, Yu must reunite the now defunct Durchhalten. The group had disbanded after the tragic incident, and he wants everyone to be there when Miho opens her eyes once more.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059670/extras/shibuya_steam.png?t=1580431245\" /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059670/extras/steam_banners_(1).png?t=1580431245\" /></span>",
