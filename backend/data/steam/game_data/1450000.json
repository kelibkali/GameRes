Great for novice players and experts alike. Choose your difficulty level and sharpen your game!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPuzzles start simple and gradually increase in complexity. For novice players, there are unlimited chances to find the safe square. For advanced players, there are aggressive time and accuracy challenges.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to standard chess pieces, Safe Squares introduces non-standard pieces for an extra challenge.
