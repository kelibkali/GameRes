    "description": "What's the Matter? is a fun and challenging twin stick shooter that introduces you to the periodic table of elements.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay as Matty Matter, a bit of matter, as he sets off on rescue missions throughout the universe to save other bits of matter in need.  Crashed transport ships, lost vacationers and prison escapees all need your help.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nProgress through the periodic table of elements as you move through space and collect your matter friends.  Maneuver your way through asteroid fields,  around comets and near stars.  Fight off numerous aliens, robots and other creatures.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery time you die, you start back at the beginning, but get an opportunity to upgrade Matty using points you've just collected.   There are thousands of upgrade combinations making Matty unique each time you play.   Upgrades are unlocked as you progress through the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDEMO includes level 1 up to element 65.",
