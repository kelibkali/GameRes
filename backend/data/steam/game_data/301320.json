    "description": "<strong>NoLimits 2</strong> is the ultimate roller coaster simulation that lets you experience authentic roller coaster thrills. Climb into the world's most famous roller coasters and experience the excitement in real time. Or design a new roller coaster that is engineered to your specifications. <br><br>Use a full-featured roller coaster editor with a CAD-style wire-frame display to build a custom coaster. Drag and drop track, supporting structures, and other objects. Use slider bars to change the perspective of the elements being designed, and to zoom in and out. Your only constraints are the laws of physics and your imagination. <br><br>After you have designed and constructed your roller coaster, <strong>NoLimits 2</strong> serves up a real-time roller coaster experience, from the time the train chugs its way up the first slope, to the time it stops to a stop on the exit platform. The simulation includes the sounds of the wind rushing by, and the metal-on-metal sounds that are integral to enjoying a coaster ride. It's easy to choose any seat on any car in the coaster train. Use the computer's mouse to change the line of sight and angle of vision. <br><br><strong>NoLimits 2</strong> is the world's most comprehensive roller coaster simulation, with results so realistic that professional designers like <i>John Wardley</i> use <strong>NoLimits 2</strong> to create and test designs for physical roller coasters. Roller coaster manufacturers including <i>Vekoma Rides Manufacturing B.V., The Gravity Group, Inc., Great Coasters International, Inc., Premier, Inc., Maurer Söhne GmbH, Intamin A.G.</i> and others have used NoLimits for purposes including layout, design and integration, visualization and marketing.<br><br><strong>NoLimits Roller Coaster Simulation 2</strong> is the ultimate roller coaster simulation, hands down.
