    "description": "Marius is the first VR experience of the newly founded VR Studio &quot;Granola Studios&quot;. It’s meant as a demo to show the visual and interactive capabilities of the team. In the beginning the player is welcomed by Marius where the team shows it’s capabilities of high-quality animation in VR. The VR experience immerses the player in a huge library which can be fully explored. While the player walks around and plays with objects laying around Marius is moving his trolley around. <br />\nAs VR is not only about gaming but also about creating artificial and believable environments this VR experience shows the visual capabilities of today’s VR. It’s a great entry-level experience for all casual or even non-gamers who just have purchased a VR headset and want to check out some great environments and experiences.",
