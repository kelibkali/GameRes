    "description": "<strong>Legend of the 9 Swords: Side Story</strong> is a 2-Dimensional illustrated role-playing game that is an introduction to the characters and abilities from the full game.  In the Side Story you join Neyru, Rethis, Shi'ar and Chathien as they hunt the inter-dimensional criminal Kast. This fantasy RPG has each frame hand animated to emphasize the style of the characters and bring Team tactic role-playing battle to life beyond super-deformed or icon driven battles.  The side story  is representative of the final game that we seek to finish and we hope you see what we have always loved.  A great story.",
