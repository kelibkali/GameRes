    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >There is no “taking turns” in war!</h2>Clash of Command is a Team vs Team WeGo Tactical Strategy game. The WeGo system is a truly realistic combat simulation system: All players plan and issue orders to their units at the same time. Orders are then processed simultaneously and the resulting after action reports are then sent to players for review and planning for the next turn.  Using our custom game engine; you will strategically plan orders for some of histories most famous units, and then watch as your carefully laid plans are laid to waste by the chaos of war (Its fun! We promise).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Take Command of History</h2>The Clash of Command series puts you in command at some of the most pivotal moments of human history. Outmaneuver your opponents, race to capture key objectives and/or reduce your enemy to ashes!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >True Multiplayer Chain of Command</h2>Clash of Command will be available in both a unique and historically accurate Team vs Team “Versus” mode (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 5v5 games available), a Co-op Team vs AI mode (5, 4, 3 or 2 player), and a single player mode.
