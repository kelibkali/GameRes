    "description": "In this shooter game you will get to experience the thrill of shooting at dinosaurs! You begin with a few casual hunts to go after harmless herbivores. Once you gain a bit of experience with shooting and earn some cash to buy bigger guns, you can go on missions to take down much more dangerous prey that won't just run away at the sight of your pistol! Happy hunting!",
