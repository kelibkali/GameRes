    "description": "On this journey you will connect with the dear Master Enodio and with Lanius, Albius's faithful friend. You will hear about the eight Master Explorers and the artist, writer and inventor, the unique and perfect Mivos Esterus.<br />\r\nEONIA is a game to be enjoyed alone. A vast and colorful place where you must explore every corner to know its mysteries and legends.<br />\r\nYou will find books and scrolls that will help you learn new skills and discover the rich history that surrounds it.<br />\r\nThere are dozens of items and a wide variety of skills.<br />\r\nYou can navigate by boat and over land to travel long distances in seconds thanks to the Magic Portals that the Forgotten Civilization built years ago.<br />\r\nYou can build structures and the chests and their mysteries will not be a difficult task if you have a lockpick and the necessary knowledge.<br />\r\nA skill tree will show you everything you already know and how much you need to learn. Let's not forget that Albius is a simple apprentice.<br />\r\nA complete inventory will allow you to track objects and know their characteristics and uses.<br />\r\nA mission journal will allow you to understand what remains to be done and what adventure to continue.<br />\r\nLife surrounds each stone and you will have to learn what advantage you can get from it through all kinds of books.<br />\r\nBooks are an inexhaustible source of knowledge in the EONIA world and there are many of them and, perhaps with a little luck, you will be able to solve the mysteries of EONIA.<br />\r\nAnd let's not forget what Master Enodio always says: &quot;The one who seeks, shall find a reward.&quot;",
