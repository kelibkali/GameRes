I haven't slept in what seems like ages - I try and shut my eyes but I keep hearing strange noises outside.<br> <br>The streets echo with desperate screams and it's too dangerous to be out for long.  There are crazy people running around, attacking anyone in sight - it's like they are infected with some sort of virus. <br><br>I watched one of them stand up not long after he was shot multiple times in the chest.  It's surely only a matter of time before the infected come bursting through the door here.<br><br>None of it makes any sense.  I don’t know how this all happened but I do know that I'm not safe here.  Where is the military? Are they even around any more?  I don't know what's going on and in the city I am totally alone. <br> <br>I am certain you are still out there somewhere, I can feel it.  I want you to know that I will wait for you... Do not think that I am leaving you - you are and always will be with me and my love for you will be forever.<br> <br>If you read this I will have made my way out of here.  I will wait for you at the gas station just a few miles out of town.<br> <br>I hope I can be there tomorrow evening and I will wait for a week.  If you do not show up I will be heading north, to try and find someone - anyone - who might have survived this.<br> <br>Forever yours.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://media.indiedb.com/cache/images/games/1/24/23482/thumb_620x2000/running.png\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://media.indiedb.com/cache/images/games/1/24/23482/thumb_620x2000/SOUNDTRACK.png\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" /></span><br>Buy the awesome soundtrack of this game at <br>1 Blind to the signs<br>2 Sundown<br>3 Paradigm shift<br>4 Parameters<br>5 Geopolitic<br>6 Ignore your programming<br>7 Asphodel meadows<br>8 Butterfly (Cast of Thousands)",
