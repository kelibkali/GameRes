    "description": "<strong>Grotesque Tactics</strong> is a story driven, satirical RPG with a strategic combat system. A party of 10 anti-heroes are fighting in a grotesque world that combines the features and clichés of Western and Asian Strategy RPGs like Final Fantasy Tactics, Heroes of Might &amp; Magic and Fire Emblem.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Grotesque Tactics</strong> weaves a humorous storyline and plenty of amusing dialogue, poking fun at some of the most successful RPGs, such as Oblivion, Gothic and Lord of the Rings.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tTo protect the kingdom from the merciless cult &quot;The Dark Church&quot; which has murdered all of the kingdom’s heroes and knights, you will have to hire dubious soldiers and rescue jealous maidens who will follow you into combat as your groupies.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2>\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Turn based tactical battles with humorous animations not seen in any RPG <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Distinctive party members such as the arrogant Holy Avatar, the blood thirsty Vampire Solitaire, the sweet but hot-tempered Angel Angelina and many more <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Gorgeous village landscapes and dark, sinister dungeons <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Scantily dressed maidens to be freed from the grasp of merciless monsters <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Enormous, highly detailed and very angry end bosses <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Classical RPG elements: quests, treasures, trade, leveling up and out¬fitting a party of unique heroes<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Enjoyable multiple choice dialogues and conversation puzzles in the style of classic adventure games, such as Monkey Island or Maniac Mansion<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li></ul>*In chess, a <strong>Grotesque</strong> is a problem or endgame study which features a particularly unlikely initial position, especially one in which White fights with a very small force against a much larger black army. Grotesques are generally intended to be humorous.",
