    "description": "The Rockwell B-1B Lancer™, affectionately known as the &quot;Bone&quot; to its crews, is a key element of the American Strategic Long Range bomber fleet. The aircraft, while not technically stealth-capable, is designed to present only a fraction of the radar profile of earlier large bomber types and incorporates extremely advanced navigation, weapons, and avionics systems. Its swing wing technology, combined with four 30,000-lb thrust turbofan engines, creates a beautiful, fast, and instantly recognisable package. The development of this successor to the B-52™ began in the early 1960's and resulted in a contract being awarded to Rockwell in 1970. The B-1A™ first flew in 1974 but only 3 prototypes were built. 1981 saw an order placed for a fleet of 100 B-1Bs™, the last of which were delivered in the early 1990's.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Native FSX model with all FSX features <br></li><li>Authentic virtual cockpit with animations and mousable controls <br></li><li>Many custom interior and exterior animations including automatic wing sweep on load-up <br></li><li>Opening bomb bays with various era-specific payloads <br></li><li>Animated afterburner cans with realistic flame effects <br></li><li>Night lighting textures and effects inside and out <br></li><li>High-fidelity sounds set from Turbine Sound Studios <br></li><li>custom afterburner rumble sound <br></li><li>Many simulated cockpit systems, including the VSD <br></li><li>Researched and authentic flight dynamics <br></li><li>37-page PDF illustrated user manual in .pdf format</li></ul><br><br>**Note – this aircraft does not feature a 2D panel<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491490/extras/9fe7184d2ad958dfa1df0a6bde23a944.avif?t=1537268909\" width=120 height=114 /></span>",
