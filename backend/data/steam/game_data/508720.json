Unlike classic &quot;Color Lines&quot; our game contains six game modes. I.e. besides lines, as the game's name implies, you''ll be able to compose various figures (squares, blocks, rings, crosses and lines of alternating colors). You'll be able to choose preferable game mode by clicking appropriate buttons to the right of the game-field. More detailed info is available at the &quot;Game Modes&quot; section.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Game modes</h2>There are 6 game modes in the game:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Line<br></li><li> Square<br></li><li> Ring<br></li><li> Cross<br></li><li> Block<br></li><li> Line2<br><br>The basic idea of every game mode is similar.
