It’s perfect for your narrative structure designs. Each node in your story or mission flowchart can contain an inner flowchart. For example, you can start with a top-level chapter-like structure and break it down into single lines of branching dialog. This nested approach ensures clean and organized flowcharts.<br><br>Finally, use the Simulation mode to test your flow logic before you export it. You can also use variables within this visual play-through mode. For instance, if you want a line of dialog only to show up when certain conditions are fulfilled.<br><br><strong><u>Game Object Database Features</u></strong><br>articy:draft includes a powerful game object database with a flexible template system. Build everything, from characters, items, spells to weapons and skills. Create your objects as templates and use them wherever you need them.<br><br><strong><u>Location Planning Features</u></strong><br>With its build-in location editor, a vector-based 2D drawing tool, you can easily plan your game world and single levels. This editor is an iteration-friendly sketching tool for maps and scenarios. You can place story events, spawn points and trigger zones on the map for planning purposes. For some game genres, the location editor can even produce the actual game output. For example 2D layer-based backgrounds for point’n’click adventures or hidden object games.",
