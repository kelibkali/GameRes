The price of freedom is simple: Erase 10 names from the Warden's &quot;Black Ledger.&quot; But in this world, nothing is simple.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>The Flinch: Unforgiven West</strong> invites you to an unforgiving, stylized &quot;Noir-Western&quot; world where you fight not just against enemies, but against your own nerves using <strong>nothing but your mouse.</strong></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >🔫 <strong>Physics-Based Aiming (Mouse-Only Controls)</strong> Forget the keyboard. <strong>The entire game is played with just one hand,</strong> giving you total control over the trigger. There is no auto-lock. Adrenaline, the weight of the gun, and the sway of your hand make every shot a gamble. Hold your breath, wait for the perfect moment, and click to kill. In this game, there is no &quot;Health Bar,&quot; only a &quot;Margin of Error.&quot;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >🎨 <strong>Sharp-Edged Noir Aesthetics</strong> In a pitch-black world, the only thing lighting your path is the muzzle flash. A 2.5D visual feast blending sharp silhouettes inspired by classic graphic novels with a black-and-white and blood-red atmosphere. You will recognize enemies not just by their shapes, but by the ominous glint in their eyes.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >🗺️ <strong>A Living, Unforgiving Map</strong> Navigate through 3D canyons, dark mines, and ominous towns on an open-world map with strategic depth—<strong>all controlled by your cursor.</strong> Use shadows to avoid ambushes, manage your scarce resources, and hunt down the killer whose silhouette now haunts your &quot;Wanted&quot; poster.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >⚖️ <strong>Choose Your Soul: Blood or Redemption?</strong> The &quot;Honor System&quot; changes not just the story, but the very way you handle your mouse.</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>The Red Path:</strong> Be ruthless. Your gun kicks harder but deals lethal damage.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>The Blue Path:</strong> Be merciful. Disarm enemies with precision shots. Requires nerves of steel. The world and its colors—your poncho and your eyes—will shift to reflect your state of mind.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >💀 <strong>A Cursed Economy</strong> Here, wealth isn't the dollars in your pocket; it's the bullet in your chamber. Every shot costs a meal. A blind fire can lead to bankruptcy. When you die, you lose not just your money, but your dignity. To get it back, you must face your own ghost.</p>",
