Your aim is to murder all of the Town Council so you can rule over the hapless townsfolk in a rein (sic) of terror!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2076260/extras/fca85ae481978250ac41f5a5ebc01ed0.avif?t=1761313588\" width=256 height=144 /></span><br><br>You are not alone - you have your faithful pet  who can be sent out to perform tasks during the day while you work your trade as a confectioner. There is also a mystery pony in the town who is aware of what you are and has become a twisted fanatic. Your pet and this dark Disciple will help you learn the roles of the Town Council and where they live. Armed with this information you can decide who presents the greatest threat - if the town uncovers your identity, they will surely avenge themselves by lynching you!<br><br>As the game progresses, the town becomes ever more dangerous and paranoid and will frantically increase their efforts to destroy you. Craft fiendish and irresistible cakes, drop in on the townsfolk and murder them, gaslight innocent ponies into doubting their own innocence, kidnap victims and lock them in your basement - they will probably try and barter for their lives with information. Hopeless, of course.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2076260/extras/95d32f34a1e85aaefe68a5e304d5261d.avif?t=1761313588\" width=256 height=144 /></span><br><br>With elements of &quot;Werewolf&quot;, this twisted RPG procedurally generates a new town every game.<br><br>Good luck, you evil horse.",
