Brass: Birmingham takes you back in time again, when a knack for strategic thinking fueled by gut instinct could sketch biographies of the likes of Friedrich Krupp or Richard Arkwright. Will you manage to follow in the footsteps of mighty industrialists from the era of iron and steam power?<br />\r\n <br />\r\nUse your resources. Extract coal from the nearest mines to create new canal or rail links and industries. Supply iron from the surrounding ironworks to develop old industries and build new ones. Entice your clients with beer to more easily sell the fruits of your labor.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nDevelop the industry. Play appropriate cards and resources to build new coal mines and ironworks as well as cotton mills, breweries, potteries and manufactories. Discard cards to enhance your technological base and build even better and more profitable industries.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nBe the best. Show you have a true flair for business during two distinct historical eras of Industrial Revolution, the canal era and the rail era, and achieve the ultimate victory by selling all your products and linking the greatest number of industries and merchant towns together.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nAre you going the be the best?
