    "description": "Subterrarium is a game about digging your way home through…unconventional means.  <br>Collect money from dirt, use it to buy soda from vending machines, and then use that soda to water the seeds scattered around the level.  <br>Every plant gives you an advantage, whether it’s a vine that allows you to reach great heights, or a bombplant that clears out a chunk of dirt for you.  <br>But be careful—with every move, the dirt becomes more unstable.  One wrong step could lead to a fatal cave-in.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Mind-bending puzzles about plant growing and money management<br></li><li>An adventure mode featuring procedurally generated puzzles that change every time you play</li></ul>",
