This does not make sense, why did so many people have to perish before action was taken to close down the mine, and how could so many sneak in when the mine is under constant surveillance?<br><br>The Purple Lavender mine is scheduled to be cemented in tomorrow morning. This gives me enough time to quickly get in, document the area, and get out. Something is being hidden, and I intend to find out what.<br><br><strong>Here is what I know so far about the Purple Lavender Mine:</strong><br>1)\tIt is reported to have 6 depths, however, I do not believe this has been confirmed.<br>2)\tThere is a rumor, the deeper you descend, the more messed up things you will experience. Supposedly the pressure starts to mess with your head.<br>3)\tThe original miners 70 or so years ago are a mystery. Nobody knows who they were or who their families were.<br><br>All that is left to do is to set out and hope for the best…<br><br>Inside Depth 6 is a short horror game with an estimated single completion time of ~60 min. As such, <strong> Inside Depth 6 does NOT offer save-game functionality. Inside Depth 6 must be completed in a SINGLE SITTING</strong>.<br><br>Inside Depth 6 includes <strong>3 endings</strong> coupled with all sorts of <strong>achievements</strong>, <strong>puzzles</strong>, and <strong>mysteries</strong> to solve. And as always, you cannot go wrong with a little <strong><i>Easter egg</i></strong>!<br><br><strong><u>Developer's Note:</u></strong><br>And so, yet another game has been completed. This one came a little later than expected, but better late then never. Inside Depth 6 is the first game I've built that does not take place in a single setting. In other words, unlike Suite 776, A Girl's Fabric Face, Mind's Eyes, or any other game I've built before that typically take place in a home, Inside Depth 6 takes place in a very large mine with changing scenery every corner you turn! Of course, that is one of the reasons this game took so long to build, because it was quite literally much larger and more complicated to build than any of my previous games. Nonetheless, I believe the game turned out quite well, and I believe it does its job quite well. I genuinely hope you all enjoy the experience that Inside Depth 6 has to offer.<br><br>I am very happy to  say that I am continuing to learn new tricks in game development, and I hope to continue learning even more! It is definitely not easy being a 1-man developer who is self-taught; without a doubt, I do reach many limitations throughout the development journey; however, I believe I am still able to overcome many of my limitations to provide you all with an experience to remember!<br><br>With that being said, I want to give everybody who has provided me with support a very big thank you! I will continue to learn, grow, and provide better content for you all year-round :)<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1553320/extras/ee277cc64428e7ad0654858d15ecbc33.avif?t=1628096741\" width=640 height=360 /></span>",
