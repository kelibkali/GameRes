    "description": "The Graveyard is a very short computer game. You play an old lady who visits a graveyard. You walk around, sit on a bench and listen to a song. It's more like an explorable painting than an actual game. An experiment with poetry and storytelling but without words.                    <br />\n\t\t\t\t\tBuying the full version of The Graveyard adds only one feature, the possibility of death. The full version of the game is exactly the same as the trial, except, every time you play she may die.                    <br />\n\t\t\t\t\tDesigned by Auriea Harvey and Michael Samyn.  Animations by Laura Raines Smith. Music by Gerry De Mol. Sound effects by Kris Force.",
