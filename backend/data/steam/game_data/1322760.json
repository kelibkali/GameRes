    "description": "Overseer is a topdown rogue-like game heavily inspired by Dungeon Souls. This time, you can play with friends and enjoy the intense splashy combat together. The Overseer system allows you to take control of the dungeon and to make it more interesting and challenging: spawning monsters, placing traps, and changing the layout of the dungeon to spice things up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverseer's background story is about a mad scientist testing the greatest adventurers of all time. (One of each class), throughout the dungeon, the player will notice hidden wires and the hard light holographic room glitch out.",
