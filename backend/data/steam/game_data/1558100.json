The main occupation in the game is the design of various equipment: from a cart with a jet engine to a spacecraft with an automatic flight mode.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1558100/extras/acdf488988bec6105c7e5e2b0b629db0.webp?t=1758572357\" width=480 height=43 /></span><br>Surely in your childhood you played with the sets of a young engineer, assembling electrical circuits of varying complexity. PixPhys, in fact, is just such a set. An important feature of each set is the number of parts in it. <br>At the moment, there are more than 100 unique parts in the game, among which you will find: various types of propellers and engines, lighting, explosives, fuel system elements, and more.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1558100/extras/d205321f97d3e20724353d4485b96d6b.poster.avif?t=1758572357\" width=600 height=182 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1558100/extras/d205321f97d3e20724353d4485b96d6b.webm?t=1758572357\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1558100/extras/d205321f97d3e20724353d4485b96d6b.mp4?t=1758572357\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1558100/extras/5eee4075b8fc552ea38e1c8fc3929662.webp?t=1758572357\" width=480 height=43 /></span><br>After completing the design of the mechanical part of your new creation, you will need to set up its circuitry, which will control everything.
