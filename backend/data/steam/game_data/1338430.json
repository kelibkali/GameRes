    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You are alone. Every decision changes everything. Can you survive your own mind?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Every run is different. Your behavior matters.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Welcome to Isolation Simulator.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Imagine this: You're locked in a stark isolation chamber. There's nothing but a simple bed, a harsh ceiling light, and impenetrable steel doors sealing you in. No escape. No instructions. Just you, and the silence.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >But here's the twist—this isn't just a room. It's a mirror to your mind. The game watches you. It studies every move you make: how you pace the floor, the frantic taps on your keyboard, where your gaze lingers in the emptiness. Your behavior becomes the key. It triggers events, shaping your reality in unpredictable ways.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Start simple. A ball might appear out of nowhere, rolling across the floor, inviting you to interact. Or perhaps a fleeting shadow dances on the wall, pulling you deeper into the unknown.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >But push further, and the chamber cracks open. Suddenly, you're thrust into vast, labyrinthine maps—forgotten worlds filled with relics of a locked-down society, inspired by the isolation of the COVID-19 era. Scattered radios crackle to life, playing haunting recordings from ordinary lives shattered by quarantine: whispered confessions, desperate pleas, echoes of humanity clinging to hope amid enforced solitude.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >No two playthroughs are the same. Even identical actions can lead to wildly different outcomes, depending on the sequence of events that came before. The game adapts, evolves, reacts to your history within its walls.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >There's no clear goal here—no quests to complete, no bosses to defeat. It's an exploration of endurance, curiosity, and the human spirit under pressure. The simulation will end on its own after a cascade of events... or, if you're perceptive enough, you might uncover a hidden path to freedom, a secret conclusion buried in the chaos.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >How long can you last? What will your isolation reveal? Step inside... and let the simulation begin.</p>",
