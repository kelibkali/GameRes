    "description": "Host of the German GP 37 times, the Hockenheimring is one of the tracks with the richest heritage in the world of motorsports. Historically known for its bygone classic layout with long straights through the surrounding forests, the track was reformed for the 2002 German GP, becoming much shorter modern circuit but retaining a high speed, flowing nature perfectly suited for wheel-to-wheel racing with all types of cars.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack features 4 distinct versions of this legendary track from 4 different decades - 1977, 1988, 2001 and 2020, along with extra modern and historic layouts (National, Short A &amp; B and 1988 short).",
