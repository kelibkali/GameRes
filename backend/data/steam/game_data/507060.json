Players must complete quests by painting buildings and objects to progress the storyline. Scéal also features a day/night cycle with colour palettes and music that change as the story / time progresses. Playing as the little spirit, players can transform into an angel of light or a dark banshee, repainting the world as they move through it, changing the world from happiness to despair and back again. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlong with it's unique visual style and art direction, Scéal has a distinctive and hauntingly melodic soundtrack, sung in Irish and made in collaboration with renowned Irish folk singers Lorcan Mac Mathuna, Aislinn Duffy and Florence Glen.",
