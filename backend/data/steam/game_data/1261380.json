    "description": "For the next installment of the <strong>SUPERHOT </strong>series, the <strong>SUPERHOT Team</strong> wanted to do something, well... <strong>SUPERHOT</strong>. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1261380/extras/714bf0c2cc7def8c8a379099bf302009.poster.avif?t=1617029525\" width=616 height=176 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1261380/extras/714bf0c2cc7def8c8a379099bf302009.webm?t=1617029525\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1261380/extras/714bf0c2cc7def8c8a379099bf302009.mp4?t=1617029525\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Which is why we decided to hire Electronic Music Maestro <strong>Zardonic</strong> for the task. Since his name is mostly built as a Drum &amp; Bass producer as well as an Audio Engineer with credit highlights including Bullet For My Valentine, NBC Sports Network, TNT, Entertainment One and JVC Kenwood Victor Entertainment Corporation, we weren't sure whether fast-paced beats and loud guitars would fit the ambience of the game, considering the original was completely devoid of music in the first place.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1261380/extras/11cd3b88fbcf6709680e40dbed072e93.poster.avif?t=1617029525\" width=616 height=176 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1261380/extras/11cd3b88fbcf6709680e40dbed072e93.webm?t=1617029525\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1261380/extras/11cd3b88fbcf6709680e40dbed072e93.mp4?t=1617029525\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Little did we know that Zardonic was also a huge fan of SUPERHOT, and considers it to have the same cultural impact as some of his favorite games of all time. With such love for this project, we knew immediately that whatever would come out of his creative mind would fit the game perfectly, and we were beyond surprised. Instead of expecting beats and bass drops, the <strong>SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE</strong> soundtrack adds even more distress, anxiety, despair and uncertainty to the claustrophobic, confined nature of the SUPERHOT universe, built around an unsettling, &quot;musical&quot; motif that will invade your mind until you're never able to sleep again. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1261380/extras/184939f57d767108104772a0b85e453c.poster.avif?t=1617029525\" width=616 height=176 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1261380/extras/184939f57d767108104772a0b85e453c.webm?t=1617029525\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1261380/extras/184939f57d767108104772a0b85e453c.mp4?t=1617029525\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Heed our advice: this will amplify your SUPERHOT experience in ways that will make it fall short of a health hazard, and if that is not enough for you, perhaps you will enjoy the inclusion of a bonus exclusive Drum &amp; Bass remix.
