You start on the first day with a group of three insurgents whose first task is to get their weapons and get to the base camp safely. You participate in a tragic yet heroic chapter of the capital's history. Your job is to survive as long as possible. There is only one way to do this: by fighting with a weapon in hand.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>LEAD AND MANAGE YOUR TEAM</strong></h2><br>Make key decisions and lead soldiers through the 63 days of the Warsaw Uprising. Acquire weapons, ammunition and other resources needed for the survival of your comrades. Disarm enemy units, neutralise artillery and help the fighting Warsaw! In the new, expanded version of the project, you have the chance to experience missions based on the actual events of the Warsaw Uprising. In addition, photographs of figures, archival documents and posters directly related to the Uprising appear as part of the gameplay. The game is also supplemented with a comprehensive timeline showing key events day by day.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>DEVELOP SKILLS</strong></h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1026420/extras/01f9eb799915c5d0d59d7e846fde52de.poster.avif?t=1734523174\" width=616 height=168 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1026420/extras/01f9eb799915c5d0d59d7e846fde52de.webm?t=1734523174\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1026420/extras/01f9eb799915c5d0d59d7e846fde52de.mp4?t=1734523174\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Defeat the enemy not only with strength but primarily with cleverness. Use the skills of your subordinates to gain an advantage over the enemy. Regularly sweep German hiding spots and armouries to procure weapons for the Uprising. Manage weapons and ammunition so that your heroes are properly equipped for clashes with the enemy. Promote the heroic insurgents as well, who will acquire – increasingly useful in clashes – skills over time and form an effective, cohesive team.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>EXPLORE THE CITY</strong></h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1026420/extras/5a99d91c361becbc4d278d5009e489a9.poster.avif?t=1734523174\" width=614 height=168 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1026420/extras/5a99d91c361becbc4d278d5009e489a9.webm?t=1734523174\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1026420/extras/5a99d91c361becbc4d278d5009e489a9.mp4?t=1734523174\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Navigate your way around a detailed map of Warsaw in 1944. Sneak through alleys and secret passages, make your way through ruins and obstacles. Patrol streets cleared of the enemy and follow your command's orders while uncovering facts about your heroes' past. As a commander, decide when to step up to the fight and when to retreat. Warsaw's landscape changes with the passing of time, and the game reflects the degree of destruction of the city in the subsequent phases of fighting. The advantage of the occupying forces is growing every day and this battle cannot be won. But after all, you are fighting for a just cause, for a free Poland!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>ADVANTAGES OF THE GAME</strong></h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1026420/extras/bd7437e5257661291b2709b19069db47.avif?t=1734523174\" width=600 height=150 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A tactical turn-based RPG set in the realities of World War II, with many interesting character profiles as well as skill and resource management<br></li><li>Extensive, tactical combat system with a wide range of character abilities, weapons and skills<br></li><li>Rich storyline based on the exciting stories of individual characters that are revealed as you progress; historical and fictional events woven into the game and tailored in time and place to individual gameplay styles<br></li><li>Non-linear flow of the game, so that the development of the situation as well as the ending is completely in the hands of the player<br></li><li>Numerous details, from the design of costumes, uniforms, equipment items, weapons and vehicles to the missions, historical events and voice-overs of the performing characters in their native languages are based on the historical originals.<br></li><li>The entire project has been designed with care for historical fidelity, which enriches its educational value.</li></ul><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1026420/extras/3754424b5b60186d9bc1628dd5c50493.webp?t=1734523174\" width=600 height=19 /></span>",
