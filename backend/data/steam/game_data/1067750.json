    "description": "Thanks to the overwhelmingly positive response to the 'Warriors of the North' DLC, and many people expressing their desire to support us even beyond the asking price, we've decided to also offer it as a special Supporter Edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‘Warriors of the North’ DLC is all about the northern regions and the untamed barbarian tribes calling it their home. Now your company can boast banner and shields depicting a barbarian deity to strike fear into the hearts of the southlanders! The banner is given to you as a 'thank you' for purchasing the 'Warriors of the North Supporter Edition' and can not be acquired separately.",
