When a player wins a round, he or she will earn the Queen’s favor, but will also earn the wrath of the other players, who are then able to vote to take away one of the winner’s powers! Get ready to even the odds against your opponents as you take away the powers they hold most dear and hilariously watch how they deal with the consequences! Whoever is the first person to win three rounds, becomes the Royal Champion!<br><br>In the world of DepowerBall, you will need to adapt to the changing conditions, or get left behind as the other players take advantage of your weakened state!<br><br>Welcome to the pit.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >KEY FEATURES</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Local Multiplayer action for 1-4 players (or play with bots to train) - NOTE: If you are playing with more than 1 person locally everyone must use a controller.<br></li><li>Online Multiplayer action where you can play alone in Quick Match or in a Party with up to 4 in a group!<br></li><li>Balanced Gameplay -  where winning a round means losing one of your powers, ensuring a competitive atmosphere<br></li><li>Spectator mode for parties available for casting/streaming!<br></li><li>Power Drafting - Where all players get to decide which powers are used in a match!<br></li><li>Five levels with ridiculous hazards!<br></li><li>Two different game modes to keep things fresh (DepowerBall and T.A.G.)!<br></li><li>Eight adorable characters to choose from!<br></li><li>Dress your characters up with unlockable accessories to showcase your own personality!</li></ul>",
