But now the Wall of Rejection has fallen, and Maxx and Humkey have to figure out what is happening outside the borders of the Sanctuary. What kind of aliens arrived at the deserted Salangan? Why did APOSTLE allow them to settle here? And what are their goals? Will the meeting with them be a battle or peaceful contact of the inhabitants of different worlds?<br />\r\nAnswers to these and many other questions wait for you in the second part of our story - the game Zeliria Sanctuary 2: Xinori Asylum",
