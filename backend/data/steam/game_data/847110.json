The controls are so simple that a lemming could play this game, but rumor says that only a god can finish it. Leaderboards and a ridiculous amount of statistics are available for ship measuring contests.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Face the truth about your skills</h2>Discover what you are made of and challenge your spirit through three hostile worlds: hit walls at 1000 mph, be crushed by giant blocks, cut in half by spinning blades, compressed by robots. Dare to go further in insanity to find the <strong>hidden dark portals</strong>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Super fine controls</strong> - Boost, dash and fly to avoid death<br></li><li><strong>Killing machines</strong> - More than 20 different types of traps (with some smart ones)<br></li><li><strong>Leaderboards &amp; stats</strong> - challenge your friends and your enemies<br></li><li><strong>Speedrun mode</strong> - Obviously<br></li><li><strong>Death counter</strong> - To remind you the millions of time you exploded<br></li><li><strong>Dark portals</strong> - Super freaky difficult hidden dark portals<br></li><li><strong>Inspiring quotes</strong> - To appease your mind<br></li><li><strong>A sense of fulfillment</strong> - Like none you had before</li></ul>",
