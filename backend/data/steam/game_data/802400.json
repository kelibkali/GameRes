Content Creator, for players to write their own stories for the game and enjoy it with their friends. All that is needed is a story idea and no programming is required. We provided players with a Quick start video guide, Content Creator Guide and even released all of Fhtagn!'s event stories to aid in this process. If you are interested in creating your own stories, you can check out more information on our Content Creator, on our forum page.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/802400/extras/7bf0a17652625f9a76cde76e392af5f5.poster.avif?t=1750144375\" width=616 height=32 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/802400/extras/7bf0a17652625f9a76cde76e392af5f5.webm?t=1750144375\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/802400/extras/7bf0a17652625f9a76cde76e392af5f5.mp4?t=1750144375\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Join the community</h2>We want to help community members create their own story packs (cooperative or solo endeavours) for the game and the Fhtagn!

We currently don’t have the resources to produce the game in other languages, in a way that is authentic and will do the stories and humor in it justice. However, we encourage players to create content in any languages they want and spread the madness that is Fhtagn!
