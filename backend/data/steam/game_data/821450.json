    "description": "Pushing Points MOP Booleans Kit is a Modo indie Kit designed to remove the challenges of working with complex boolean operations and introduces a non-destructive workflow that makes creating highly detailed meshes a trivial task.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPolygons, Modo Subdivs and Catmul-Clarke SubDs with Edge weights can all be used together in a single mesh allowing you to blend multiple polygon types.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBased on Tor Frick's modeling workflow, this kit opens up a new world of creative possibilities for artists and designers. By adding MOP Booleans to your workflow, you will be able to take advantage of Modo's new Mesh Op modeling operations that will let you interactively blend, add and subtract mesh items to create models faster and more efficiently than ever before.",
