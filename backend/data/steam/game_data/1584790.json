And when he needed people for a dangerous punitive operation, he already knew who to call. A squad led by the tankman razed the den of raiders to the ground. But the fight was difficult. Wounded and stunned by explosions, he literally crushed the last enemies with the tank tracks. The cannon he had gotten from the Scar AB’s storage did not survive the battle.<br><br>Major Stahl was impressed with Mateusz’s combat skills and bravery. He invited him to become the “sheriff” of the Brotherhood territories near the Valley, to which the tankman agreed without hesitation. He was granted the rank of sergeant and allowed to use the Brotherhood’s resources. Mateusz rebuilt his tank and organized his own brigade. Thus, hardened in many battles, Sergeant Uzarski stood up to defend civilian settlements against raiders.</i><br><br>The unique armoured cars presented in packs are known for their perfect balance of weapons, armour and speed in combat. To put the car in the garage, go to the “Packs” tab, select the desired armoured car and click the “Assemble” button.<br><br>When you purchase this pack, the number of parts that can be used to build a vehicle increases. Attention! Storage overflow is possible under certain conditions.<br><br>Buying the pack also gives early access to several faction-specific structural parts. These parts become available immediately upon purchase and are not issued again upon reaching the appropriate reputation level. Some parts are unique and can only exist in a single copy.<br><br>Unique portraits provide an excellent opportunity to stand out among the survivors.<br><br>Paint cans are a way to make your armoured car different from the pack.<br><br>Coins — is the in-game currency, which is used on the market to purchase armoured car parts from other survivors and to pay for the rent of part-building workbenches. Attention! When buying multiple packs, the acquired coins stack!",
