It's an unhurried chamber point-n-click adventure set in a Smart House struck with achootecture; meet talking cursors, get humorous reactions to almost every player action, explore a surreal mix of science fiction and alchemical imagery! It's impossible to get stuck: built-in hints are always ready to lend a helping tentacle...<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/620410/extras/f9cd73ec1ec5007d54daa990b7ef532d.avif?t=1716052134\" width=616 height=99 /></span><br>To overcome the challenges you’ll have to use your natural and implanted organs (nose, mouth, bioport, reference mollusc, caterpillar-injecta, etc.), which also communicate with each other. The game isn't very long, somewhere between 5-8 hours, but exploring the world is encouraged; even &quot;wrong&quot; actions generate unique reactions (and achievements too). You'll learn something new about this strange world, or maybe you'll just smile. Much of the game takes place in the spirit of fun classic quests like <strong>'Space Quest'</strong> and <strong>'Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road'</strong>, but towards the end the mood shifts to the darker side in the spirit of <strong>'Sanitarium'</strong> and <strong>'I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream'</strong>.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/620410/extras/c84f964b945be9b5d1e113396782bd69.avif?t=1716052134\" width=616 height=78 /></span><br>Use them for poking, sniffing, and nibbling everything in sight.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/620410/extras/5a16886d5968a7ac49ea3e4450094c86.poster.avif?t=1716052134\" width=600 height=230 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/620410/extras/5a16886d5968a7ac49ea3e4450094c86.webm?t=1716052134\" type=\"video/webm;

Welcome to the world of living technologies: a world in which computers can be fed and cured, where insect hormones revitalize memory, biofactories exist that give birth to household utensils, and genetically-modified molds can generate virtual realities! However, this bizarre idyll is disrupted by a mysterious epidemic…<br><br>The implantation of neural networks into the brain served humanity for good, helping people sort information, clean their thoughts, and filter out odors and tastes. But some considered the experiment dangerous—what if instead of adjusting to an individual, it would rewrite them? Neural networks gathered data, learning from within about the weaknesses of their carriers, and optimized themselves. Then suddenly, an explosion! The Worm epidemic subjugated humanity to their neural networks, and took control. Now there are whole “worm” cities, whose inhabitants are busy with sinister rituals and searching for new victims.<br><br>Having entered this brave new world, can you find the <strong>Exit</strong>?<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/620410/extras/3fa041d9b4d783eeb168ae0e4fad9966.avif?t=1716052134\" width=616 height=250 /></span>",
