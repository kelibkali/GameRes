More details at !<br><br>JOIN THE CASTLE KONG DISCORD!!<br><br><br>WATCH TWITCH STREAMS!<br><br><br><i>Castle Kong</i> is Drowning Monkeys homage to what we consider the best game ever made: Galaga.<br><br>Anyways...<br><br>What makes the golden age of arcade gaming so fun is a simple concept: 1 coin (Meaning no restarts or additional lives. there are no actual coins on the PC version of the game), 3 lives. play till you die or hit the kill screen, and set a high score.<br><br>And that's what <i>Castle Kong</i> is all about.  Just like the game it's based on (Probably not Galaga), CK will be a ruthless, 4 stage, 22 level romp as you play PauperBoy, a young kid who sets out to save PrincessGirl from the evil clutches of BaronMan.<br><br>Unlike it's predecessors, we leverage the power of connectivity to host tournaments (with a championship!), verify high scores, and have a global leaderboard.<br><br>And As Always,<br>if anyone's interested, a kill screen is coming up.",
