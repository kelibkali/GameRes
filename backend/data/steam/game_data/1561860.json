Games like Centipede or Marble Madness that use that giant trackball. In fact, this game was originally created and placed in an arcade machine to promote a local game festival. If you’d like to try out that classic arcade feel, the game has been setup to work with the default setup on an X-Arcade Tankstick With a Trackball.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Six Levels</h2>There are just 6 levels in Marble Muse Arcade. This is intentional as many of the classic arcade games had a similar number. Each time you complete all 6, you will start back at the beginning, but the difficulty will be ramped up. Mastering each level will be critical in achieving those high scores, just like the classics!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Marble Legend Award</h2>If you reach the Legend achievement, you have the opportunity to receive a 3D printed award!
