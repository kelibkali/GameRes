    "description": "Set slightly into the future, many things have changed but the good old newspaper hasn't. In a fictional town called West Ville, players jump aboard a futuristic hoverboard and deliver newspapers to as many customers as possible. A fast paced game where players must navigate their way through the streets, avoiding many obstacles as they progress whilst meeting the required points score. Quick-wittedness is required especially when navigating traffic, animals, characters and other obstacles within the game.<br><br>Budding Paperboys and Papergirls can now fully test their throwing and newspaper delivery skills over 21 levels using the games' highly advanced simulated physics. Challenge yourself further with 'Spin Mode' or for those wanting to flex their muscles, 'Fitness mode'.<br><br>Rack up the points and you too can become a VR Paper Star!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tArcade newspaper throwing madness<br></li><li>\tSuper accurate physical throwing mechanic with VR controllers<br></li><li>\t360 degree fully immersive VR experience<br></li><li>\t21 levels in an epic town setting<br></li><li>\tAI Lawnmowers, Self driving cars, Star coins, Mollie the cat and a huge cast of characters<br></li><li>\tSpecialised VR score HUD for better immersion <br></li><li>\tSpin Mode<br></li><li>\tFeaturing original music <br></li><li>\tPhysical &amp; mental challenge<br></li><li>\tReal-time lighting and shadows</li></ul>",
