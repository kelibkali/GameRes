A young woman on the brink of its extinction, she is the final hope for humanity in a world that treats her like a virus. Asha grows up living in defense. With her father by her side, they survive the apocalypse by trekking through the wastelands of the Himalayan region. <br><br><br>Her father teaches her everything he knows about how to survive in this new world. Hunting, scavenging, and fighting her way through each day, all with a kind heart and steely determination. Ever the mentor, her father injects a final hope for humanity in his daughter: his life’s work, the last human settlement, the biodome called Oakenfold. It will launch into the stars with the last remnants of humanity aboard, ready to start anew. <br><br>Asha, now a young woman, is alone. While they embarked on one of their many journeys to the power plant, her father, and the rest of their collection team, perished in a biocide attack, where he protected Asha from getting stabbed by shielding her with his own body. Though the death of her father is painful, Asha must continue the mission the two of them had set out to complete: to retrieve the last of the fuel-packed crates to power up Oakenfold’s systems.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Asha's mindsets</h2>You'll be able to play the game with varying mindsets of Asha, each giving her unique starting abilities.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1494450/extras/0e562e8b4aa8b852e7396dabaa4d9a31.poster.avif?t=1751358495\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1494450/extras/0e562e8b4aa8b852e7396dabaa4d9a31.webm?t=1751358495\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1494450/extras/0e562e8b4aa8b852e7396dabaa4d9a31.mp4?t=1751358495\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Join the Community</h2>",
