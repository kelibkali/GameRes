The air forces of the Black Sea fleet played a major role in the fighting, striking airfields, seaports and surface targets and providing air cover for the troops of the North Caucasian front as well as supporting Soviet marine landings. This is the story of a former fighter pilot who has been transferred to the 47th Attack Aviation Regiment of the Black Sea Air Force after recovering from a serious wound. Incapable of flying a nimble fighter anymore and starting as a simple wingman once again, this time piloting an IL-2, he has a long road in front of him to eventually become the Deputy Commander of the regiment.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Timeframe: April 16th - October 9th, 1943.<br></li><li>Regiment: 47th ShAP VVS VMF <br></li><li>Available aircraft: IL-2 AM-38F (model 1943) <br></li><li>Duration: 15 missions<br></li><li>Average playtime: 7 hours</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/629700/extras/e8f9451f0452b50860b540ebb4fc1aa6.avif?t=1734535474\" width=598 height=238 /></span>",
