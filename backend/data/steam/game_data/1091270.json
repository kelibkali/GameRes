    "description": "You stumble upon an ancient machine from a lost civilization, with no memory of how you came to be in this new world.  Discover the correct sequence to turn on the machine and open the doorway to another frequency dimension.  Exploration is key while you turn on and tune machines throughout this new world. Puzzling and perplexing it may be but the reward will be great.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy goal was to give you a cinematic immersive experience. I plan on adding more worlds over time. All game expansions will be free for game owners. We also will be having a public and private beta as we expand other areas and worlds.",
