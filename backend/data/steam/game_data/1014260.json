    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>About <i>Passageway of the Ancients</i></strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Inspired by classic CRPGs from the ‘90s and a few from the early 2000s, <i>Passageway of the Ancients</i> will transport you to the world of Aieryon – the galaxy’s sole remaining magical planet – where you’ll explore the city of Ithgar to solve an unspeakable crime. Beset with grief, you’ll be tasked with surviving deadly creatures lurking behind every door while gathering clues, managing your party, and leveling up your character. You also must pick locks and solve Runic puzzles to gather the best loot. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Story &amp; Gameplay</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Combat is tough, complex, and always surprising. Taking inspiration from historical weapons and tactics, <i>Passageway of the Ancients</i> employs a sophisticated combat system. Begin each encounter paused, plan your strategy, then fight in real-time, pausing again at any point (RTwP – Real Time with Pause). How you battle is up to you! Furthermore, you’ll have dual personas to deal with – a hidden “Dragonkindt,” and a public-facing race of your choosing (Dwarf, Elf, Human) – which must be leveled up at the same time. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1014260/extras/c8b6e44cfd2f20f7ea950724990396d9.avif?t=1735414619\" width=620 height=344 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Here’s the official description of Dragonkindt – taken from Jon Grierson’s unpublished novel, <br><i>The Children of Xi-Shei</i>:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > <i>“Dragonkindt are part angelic being, part shapeshifter, and part Dragon.

During that project, Hendrick was impressed with Grierson’s work ethic, creativity, and technical skills. Leveraging his 50-year history with RPGs, Grierson approached Hendrick with the idea of working together again – this time, on an indie game!</p>",
