    "description": "Arkadia is an unrefined world set centuries after a disease has destroyed humanity. To survive humans went into hiding, banding together in the darkness to create factions all their own. Now humanity has returned to rebuild civilization with the help of their cruel and sometimes malicious gods. The wilds of Arkadia are divided between five tribes: The Noctua, Ferox, Leifield, Nil Garden, and Marmis. Each group has its own quirks, beliefs, and reasons for division but all tribes fear and worship the same technology possessing Gods.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmber, a young orphan, wakes to find her brother missing and a trail of blood leading to a hide out of the gods. As she follows the rabbit down the hole, she gets caught between warring tribes, dark dungeons, mysterious monsters, and the quest to find her brother.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdeona is a retro action rpg focused on hack and slash fighting, lore rich story, and the impacts of a color changing mechanic.",
