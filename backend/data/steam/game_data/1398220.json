Your initial goal is to find a way out, but over time you will begin to feel the need for explanations. &quot;Why am I here? How did I get here? Who trapped me? What is this building, and why does it look so obvious that it's testing me? Is there anyone else here, or am I alone? Am I being watched?

They will eventually come, but you may not like what you hear.  <strong>IMPAVIDVM</strong> is not a fast experience, but it is precise, and it is fair. It is a game of pace and precision, specifically designed for players who like to perfect their technique over time, but not to be so punitive as to be frustrating for those who prefer to play without stress and enjoy the discovery of the plot.<br><br>At the end of the first play through, options specifically designed for speed runners will unlock. The game will help you perfect your technique with an internal timer and verbose statistics to help you understand where you can improve, what you did right, and what you did wrong.<br><br>Finishing the game requires moderate effort. Finishing it as quickly as possible will be a challenge to the very last frame.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1398220/extras/357377c7caf2689f9223ac4971cf7275.poster.avif?t=1683591583\" width=616 height=172 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1398220/extras/357377c7caf2689f9223ac4971cf7275.webm?t=1683591583\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1398220/extras/357377c7caf2689f9223ac4971cf7275.mp4?t=1683591583\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
