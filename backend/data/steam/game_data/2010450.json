However being at the edges (full tank or empty tank) might cause unexpected outcomes, such as explosions or debuffs, so the player need to be careful. Being at edges however has its own rewards, since Quls's attacks deal more damage if their chemtank is empty or full.<br><br>Quls is more concerned with the &quot;how&quot; questions regarding this substance, and their log has entries that revolve around how to use this substance, how to create it, and it's interactions.<br><br>Our characters could be conceived as binary opposites on their thoughts and actions, however the more players indulge on the story the more they will understand that things are more complicated.<br><br>The prologue only features the first plane and only 1 playable character, Cosmos.",
