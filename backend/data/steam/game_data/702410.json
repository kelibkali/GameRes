    "description": "Scouts inform that new lands are full of mountains. Control most important valleys and hills gives you the best position in the final battle. Build a mountain city to increase your influence. ⛰️<br> <br>Natives settlers and builders might help you, so collect goods and save money to pay them.<br> <br>Change of the rules for this expansion:<br>Mountains will be randomly generated in some of the regions on the map and two extra cards are available: &quot;Settlers&quot; and &quot;Builders&quot;.<br> <br>1. You cannot move the troop out of a mountainous region unless you leave there at least one of your troops.<br>2. The first player to build a castle in a region with mountains, builds a “mountain city”. It is worth two points when counting the control. More cities can be built in a region with mountains, but they are not counted as “mountain cities”.<br>3. Controlling a mountainous region is worth 1 extra victory point (2 instead of 1).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Settlers Card</h2> 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦<br>During your turn, you can use the &quot;Settlers&quot; card. It allows you to pay 2 coins to your opponent and use his/her cities, as if they were yours, for the purpose of recruiting troops during the current turn. Once the &quot;Settlers&quot; card has been used, it cannot be used again by any other Player. You may use the &quot;Settlers&quot; card even if you have not selected the troop recruitment action, but you have to pay one of your opponents anyway.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Builders Card</h2> 👷<br>When you complete all of your actions in your turn, you can use the &quot;Builders&quot; card if you have the required goods (goods like “joker” do not count). You must have: 2 carrots, 1 tree, and 1 iron. If you use the &quot;Builders&quot; card, you can build one city immediately. Once the &quot;Builders&quot; card has been used, it may not be used again by anyone.",
