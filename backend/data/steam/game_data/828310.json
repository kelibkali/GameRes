    "description": "Sword Mans is a physics based sword fighting brawler where you control the sword instead of the swordsman. There is a man holding on to the sword who will flop behind it as it moves. Your goal is to defeat the other players by hitting the man holding onto their sword while defending the man holding on to your sword. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis demo will give you access to the tutorial level where up to 4 people can go through a quick stage and learn a little about the game's mechanics.",
