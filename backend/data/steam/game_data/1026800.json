    "description": "while True: learn() Mega Map of Machine Learning is a huge infographic about technologies and their applications, best highlights, and key moments of ML history. You can use it as an in-class poster (for computer science classes or similar) or desktop wallpaper. Some of our players just print it out to be hanged in their offices and homes. Some of them are using it for their kids, to explain interesting facts about the tech world. Also, it is a good thing to make research for a school project.<br><br>Cats included.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Formats</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>FullHD<br></li><li>4K<br></li><li>4K Dark (best for wallpaper at desktop flooded with icons)<br></li><li>8K<br></li><li>16K<br></li><li>Vector PDF (ready to be printed of any size)</li></ul><br>To find the downloaded Mega Map please click with Right Mouse Button on while True: learn() in your Steam Library &gt; Properties &gt; Local Files &gt; Browse Local Files.
