    "description": "Blade of Acrimony is a Psychological Horror RPG made by me, Frostnoble, where you take control of Sora Loyalar and follow her on her downward spiral into insanity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a time long forgotten, a sinister sword falls from grace into the mortal realm, screaming for help for thousands of years. One day, a travesty occurs! A young woman of faith finds the blade lodged in the earth. The vile weapon speaks to Sora, tricking her into believing that he is her Lord, and that she must “save” the mortal world from sin by becoming the new Savior. She agrees and the journey starts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n-Classic turn-based combat where every choice could mean life or death<br />\r\n-Multiple endings<br />\r\n-Bone grinding difficulty<br />\r\n-Religious undertones<br />\r\n-Questioning of your own morals<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGamePlay Recommendations:<br />\r\n-Save often, this game doesn't auto save<br />\r\n-If a enemy is giving you a hard time, fight someone weaker first<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, credit to Enterbrain for some groundwork tiles.",
