    "description": "This is the future-blues synth sound of THE RIG: A STARMAP TO MURDER, as composed by Ayden 'NINGEN' Walters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the artist: &quot;My approach to the music in this game was to try to combine a neo-noir atmosphere with the feeling of a classic space adventure. I feel like we achieved a good balance, and that the music really helps players to feel like they are inhabiting the world of &quot;THE RIG.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis score is approximately 13 minutes in length. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdditional songs not included (those played over the menu and on record LPs throughout the game) were provided by Punk Rock Opera and DJ Cullah. These can be found online in FreeMusicArchive's Creative Commons library, where they can be viewed and downloaded for free.",
