    "description": "<br><i><strong>Ï̤̤N̤̤̈F̤̤̈Ï̤̤N̤̤̈Ï̤̤T̤̤̈Ë̤̤C̤̤̈Ö̤̤R̤̤̈P̤̤̤̤̈̈</strong> is a decision-based strategy card game set in a fictional cyberpunk world. You are an employee of a corporation dealing in goods distribution and logistics in the “megatower” – the place where all local citizens live. Join a world where the stakes are high, and morality is blurred.</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Discover a cyberpunk world with a vibrant vision of the future.</strong></h2>The technology in this cyberpunk world has reached the highest level of advancement and all kinds of cyber-implants and genetic modifications are commonplace. Most people have not seen living, natural plants or animals. Life for the citizens of an independent city-state founded in the middle of the ocean – “<i>Babylon 6</i>” – depends on your decisions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Each decision you make could have unfortunate consequences.</strong></h2>The world is in your hands. Choose the right strategy and make the right decisions. There are many choices – each has a definite impact on citizens’ lives. Make sure that “megacorporations” maintain an influence on the world’s operation and the lives of citizens. Corporations deal with specific fields and want to earn the highest possible profit. They do not care about their customers or their employees.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Unpredictable requests from the people will shape your future.</strong></h2>Each week of your career brings another important – seemingly random – request from your unpredictable city as you strive for a balance between the elites, the citizens, the media, criminal overlords, and the security. How will you treat the sick and wounded? You just need to know what side you're on.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Strive for a balance between different social groups.</strong></h2>The tower is divided into floors and the floors into districts. One district is large enough to have all the facilities needed for proper citizen maintenance and functioning. The division of floors is also a division of social classes – the higher you live, the higher you are in the local hierarchy.<br><br><br><br><br><i><strong>Visual novel with Cyberpunk theme</strong></i>",
