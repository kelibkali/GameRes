It takes place in a world where crowds have grown weary of traditional soccer, a game that has become too soft. During a match, the crowd will throw weapons onto the pitch to keep things lively. The winner is the team who has scored the most goals... If they can survive until the final whistle.<br><br>Deathmatch Soccer is fast paced soccer mixed with brutal combat. Gun your opponent down as they are going for the winning goal. Tactically take out opponents to deny them of options. Do whatever it takes to win!",
