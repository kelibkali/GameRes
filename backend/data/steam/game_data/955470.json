    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Royal Game of Ur</h2><strong>The Royal Game of Ur</strong> is an ancient board game where players try to race all of their tokens across the board first. Four four-sided dice determine the allowed movement, and opposing pieces are removed from the board when landed upon. This combination of luck and strategy made this game one of the most popular board games in the world 3000 years ago, and it would form the basis for other token racing games like Backgammon that are still being played by millions today.<br><br>Play the <strong>Royal Game of Ur</strong> yourself to find out what made it so immensely popular!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Play alone against the AI, or against someone else in <strong>Hotseat</strong> mode!<br></li><li>Choose between <strong>2 different routes</strong>, basic and advanced<br></li><li>Three AI levels<br></li><li>Unlock new playing pieces by winning games against the AI</li></ul>",
