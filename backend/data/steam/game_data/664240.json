    "description": "<strong>RetroWar</strong> is a collection of 8-bit <i>retro style</i> arcade games.  Currently we are focused on <strong>single-screen multiplayer games</strong> that you play with your friends <i>locally</i> (i.e. sitting on the couch together.)  <strong>Most of the games don't have single player mode</strong> (If you <i>want</i> single player mode then vote for it in the forums!)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Games</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Spaceships</strong> - vector thrust in the tradition of SpaceWar / Asteroids  / Subspace.<br></li><li><strong>Droids</strong> - fast-paced twin stick shooter.<br></li><li><strong>Tanks</strong> - tactical sniping game .<br></li><li><strong>Bomb Bots</strong> - drop bombs to blow up your opponents, but don't get caught in the blast.<br></li><li><strong>Ghost Jumpers</strong> - platform race to be first while jumping over spooky enemies.<br></li><li><strong>SnakeEaters</strong> - the classic snake game.<br></li><li><strong>Balloonacy</strong> - mash buttons to fill your balloon.</li></ul><br>Our <strong>UniBlaster</strong> game engine is designed with the specs of a 'fantasy' 1980s console, akin to an NES, but with modern standards for framerate, aspect ratio and controller input.
