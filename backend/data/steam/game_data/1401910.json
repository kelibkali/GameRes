    "description": "A re-imagining of the classic game Magestorm, fight in an all-magic battle arena as an archon pulled from time and imbued with fantastical powers in an eternal struggle between the Primal Forces - Order and Chaos. Fueled by increasingly powerful magic, defeat your foes and their shrines in a battle arena.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >All Magic</h2> This is the ultimate mage battle fantasy. Push the front lines as an elemental Magician, ambush foes with lightning as the Tempest, defend your shrine with a storm of swords as the Paladin, or deny your enemies by harnessing mana and the void as the Arcanist.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Well Tuned Gameplay</h2>Each class has a distinct playstyle and feel allowing all four to make game-winning plays.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Unique Combat</h2>This is not a Crowd Control Simulator. Combat is aggressive, tactical, and merciless.",
