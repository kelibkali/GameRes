You'll collect the finite, valuable resources and items scattered about the world, which help progress through the game's story. You'll find equipment that grants you new abilities, and new routes that make the world ever more interconnected. This world's inhabitants will try to help, sometimes offering clues or insight to guide your journey. And just when you think it's all coming together, <i>you'll realize just how deep this rabbit hole goes</i>.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1186050/extras/c6d2508a89c9fe3cc02ef9798298b0a8.poster.avif?t=1753066096\" width=750 height=204 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1186050/extras/c6d2508a89c9fe3cc02ef9798298b0a8.webm?t=1753066096\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1186050/extras/c6d2508a89c9fe3cc02ef9798298b0a8.mp4?t=1753066096\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The controls are extremely simple - at its core, you'll adventure around the world using only four directional inputs. <i>Arrow keys</i>, <i>WSAD</i>, or a <i>gamepad</i> are some options. Enemies only move when you do- so strategy is more important than reflexes. One of the design objectives was to take the simplest gameplay we could, and see how much we could create with it. And the answer turned out to be quite a lot. Hero's Spirit was developed over quite a few years, and saw several revisions and updates along the way. To say that its special to us, as developers, would be an incredible understatement- it continues to be a beloved passion project of ours.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1186050/extras/c0715433f1882bab7fa03356d8502288.poster.avif?t=1753066096\" width=750 height=204 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1186050/extras/c0715433f1882bab7fa03356d8502288.webm?t=1753066096\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1186050/extras/c0715433f1882bab7fa03356d8502288.mp4?t=1753066096\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i><strong>Hero's Spirit</strong></i> features an original, retro-styled soundtrack containing more than 80 distict tracks (and 2 hours) of music.

It has a whole pile of achievements to earn, thousands of items to collect across its sizeable world, and seemingly countless secrets to find. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1186050/extras/73ec5f5014613b209e950dbce6f74294.poster.avif?t=1753066096\" width=750 height=204 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1186050/extras/73ec5f5014613b209e950dbce6f74294.webm?t=1753066096\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1186050/extras/73ec5f5014613b209e950dbce6f74294.mp4?t=1753066096\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >And more than anything, we hope that you enjoy it- our passionate community of players is why we do what we do.</p>",
