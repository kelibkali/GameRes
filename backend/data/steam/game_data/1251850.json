You are one of the survivors, struggling to find food and resources while demons and abominations rule over the Earth.<br><br><strong>Inferno - Beyond The 7th Circle</strong> is an old-school Dungeon Crawler with survival elements. It's made for hardcore gamers and fans of 80s and 90s cRPG.<br><br>It's the spiritual successor of <strong>The 7th Circle</strong>. Unlike its predecessor, <strong>Inferno - Beyond The 7th Circle</strong> has a more &quot;classic&quot; approach to the Dungeon Crawler genre: you can now save and load the game when you want and if you die you can just reload your last saved game. Also, there are plenty of new contents: more items, more skills, more spells, more tasks, quests and lot of resources to find.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key features of the game</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Grid-based First Person Dungeon Crawler.
