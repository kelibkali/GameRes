Someone has recently been there, and you try desperately to look for help. A mysterious arcade machine called JANITOR pulls you to play itself, releasing a horrible force upon you.<br><br>The only way to survive is to go deeper into the arcade and keep playing JANITOR, but the further you go, the more the events of the arcade game start to influence the real world. When your eyes are glued to the screen, who knows what is happening right behind your back?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552310/extras/63b08694306c66825d3f15fdb4520e32.poster.avif?t=1739371058\" width=596 height=118 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552310/extras/63b08694306c66825d3f15fdb4520e32.webm?t=1739371058\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552310/extras/63b08694306c66825d3f15fdb4520e32.mp4?t=1739371058\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Explore a mysterious arcade:</strong> The dark corners and hallways hide many secrets.
