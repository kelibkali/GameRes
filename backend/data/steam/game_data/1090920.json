    "description": "Gubble is an action-puzzle maze game featuring Gubble D Gleep, an alien stranded on a planet filled with strange 3D puzzles. On most of the 150 levels Gubble needs to remove all the screws, nails, bolts and other fasteners to escape to the next level. Each fastener requires the use of the correct tool, all the while avoiding a slew of weird enemies. Gubble features non-violent, unique gameplay combining real-time movement and puzzle solving. The soundtrack was composed and performed by Seppo (Zep) Hurme.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1090920/extras/be2448096b7bf72ead98c969cb8f0843.poster.avif?t=1591721077\" width=800 height=166 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1090920/extras/be2448096b7bf72ead98c969cb8f0843.webm?t=1591721077\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1090920/extras/be2448096b7bf72ead98c969cb8f0843.mp4?t=1591721077\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Gubble was originally published as a PC game in 1996, then remastered in 2007 featuring HD graphics and additional difficulty settings.
