Either I made it to the boat my wife never knew I owned, or I never got there. Either way, the car’s all yours now. The tank’s full of gas and the fender’s tougher than they are. So enjoy the ride. And keep moving south. I hear they hate the water. </i><br><br>We Can’t Get Through The Zombies is a 1970s cop movie based a day before the zombie apocalypse.<br><br>Features:<br>Police Car<br>Zombies<br>More Zombies",
