    "description": "<strong>A Fine Art Game</strong><br>Anomalies is a generative art game.  There are no levels, points or objectives.  It is a &quot;game&quot; in the sense of being an amusement or pastime, an interactive piece of audio-visual, virtual sculpture, which one can tinker around with and explore.<br><br><strong>Generate and Explore</strong><br>The demo version of Anomalies only allows for random generation of Anomalies.  Manual tweaking and orbit or exploration cameras are turned off.  <br><br><strong>Sights and Sounds</strong><br>Anomalies are both audio and visual phenomena, the parameters that effect one effect the other. Some are strange and discordant entities, while others are symmetrical and harmonious. All the images and &quot;songs&quot; you hear in the trailer video were produced through the program's algorithms. <br><br><strong>Other Options</strong><br>Read about the other features in Anomalies on the main app page.  Most features are turned off in the demo version, but it does allow you to experience some of the sights and sounds you can expect to find in the full version.",
