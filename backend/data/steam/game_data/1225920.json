    "description": "This is a miniature tower defense strategy game. The gameplay is to prevent the enemy units, approaching the waves, from reaching our main tower by installing defensive structures in the path of the movement of enemies. Installed defensive towers attack passing enemies in sight and can be improved or moved for the cost of points gained for killing. The task of each level is to hold out a certain number of waves and protect the main tower from destruction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- A variety of levels.<br />\r\n- Juicy graphics.<br />\r\n- Relaxed gameplay.",
