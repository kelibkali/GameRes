    "description": "'Gon' E-Choo!' is a 3 stage, arcade-style game based on the earliest arcade platformers. You play as the otter, trying to collect paper airplanes while avoiding the crafty gator and irate bees. Collect them before they fall into the water, or it's game over! Fight back against the insects with your trusty yoyo or read The Junior Guide to Petty Zoological Facts to power up and turn the tables on the gator. Like the games it is based on, 'Gon' E-Choo!' is easy to learn, but hard to master. Casual players will be treated to tricky AI while master players can use the game's non-random patterns to speed run or reach the game's cryptic kill-screen. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game plays out on a virtual arcade cabinet with mechanical sounds recorded straight from arcade cabinets from the early 80s, complete with a simulated CRT monitor and VR support for maximum immersion.",
