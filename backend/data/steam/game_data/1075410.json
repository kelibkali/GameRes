Ideally Gnart wants like to stroll the archives, read old books by a long-lasting candle and safely uncover old myths. Somehow, though, he has the knack for getting himself flung out into the sprawling and dangerous world of Umbra, out into adventure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAvailable in English only. The comic book can be accessed by selecting the title menu option, &quot;Comic Book&quot; after the installation is complete.",
