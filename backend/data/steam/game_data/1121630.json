I am an old man and have many regrets. I don’t want an other one by sending you out blindly. The power of magic disappeared practically over night. We became defenceless and order were broken. We have paid the price for sharing this world with darkness. And we have forgotten what makes us stronger. All those year, we covered in fear by seeking the way of bringing magic back. And we finally discovered Rodlium, along with hope and courage. Once again we have the opportunity to reclaim our lands. And you my boy, you are shield that guards the realms of lights, you are the axe that seek justice, you are the defender of all. Go now and do not come back until the last goblin fall.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1121630/extras/4d00cdd0e5ab7ae29043f7889876a0bf.avif?t=1571057377\" width=624 height=270 /></span><br>This is a tower defense game where <i>you</i> are the tower and you can literally <i>jog</i> into their personal space of your enemies to give them a good old beating, throw your weapons to where it hurts or sling weapon abilities to wreak havoc on an island of goblinoids.<br><br>Play as a the vanguard of magic, defending magical spires from waves of enemies while they grow and restore the arcane.
