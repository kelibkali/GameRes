Players can leave at any time without affecting the others’ progression.  <br></li><li><strong>Unique Approach to 2D Art:</strong> A rich world with over 100 characters and 12 unique environments created by some of the video gaming’s most reputed artists and animators.  This creative approach to 2D design will recapture the hearts of platformer fans and introduce a new generation to one of the industry’s best-loved characters in his original 2D form.<br></li><li><strong>A Vast Playground:</strong> Rayman Origins includes over 60 levels of 2D platforming gameplay designed for all ages and playing styles.  Unlock new abilities progressively and return to previous levels to discover new paths and secrets.<br></li><li><strong>Variety of Gameplay:</strong> Rayman Origins is a platformer at its core, but it has elements of many game genres.

A possessed, mountainous golem...  An evil daisy-cum-carnivorous plant...Rayman Origins will put players to the test with these and many more challenging boss battles!<br></li><li><strong>A Handful of Highly Talented Artists and Engineers:</strong> Rayman Origins was developed by the UBIart team in Montpellier and is built on an open-source game engine - the UBIart Framework - designed by Michel Ancel to allow much smaller teams of artists and developers to produce incredibly high-quality graphics and gameplay quickly and efficiently.  This garage-game approach has led to great strides in creativity and innovation.</li></ul>",
