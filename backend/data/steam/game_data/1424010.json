    "description": "Slaves of Magic prelude is an alpha combat demo where you can have an early look at how we imagine a typical combat mission will play in the full game. The combat itself uses an innovative delayed turn-based system, where every action you choose on your turn, will take some time to actually happen. Positioning is very important, and you will have to think about not just the situation you are in right now, but of the situation, you will be, when the action actually resolve.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe goal of the mission itself is to save a VIP for the resistance. To accomplish this task, you will have a small party of 6, with predetermined skills. Your enemy will be the earth legion specialized in heavy armor and earth magic, but luckily, they are spread thin in the region. This gives you the perfect opportunity for a quick rescue mission. But beware, the longer the mission takes, the more enemies will arrive on the map! Remember, that your goal is not to kill everyone, but to save the VIP and then get to safety.",
