    "description": "The Gameshow is an FPS game where you participate in a dangerous survival game. This is not your game. You, together with other players, have been kidnapped and brought to a forest. Now, surviving is your only objective. Players have to be constantly looking for resources: food, weapons, ammunition, drugs, etc. This is the only way you can gain advantage over the other players. The show goes on until there is only one player surviving, and the survivor is the winner.",
