    "description": "ORKANA CONFLICT VR         <br />\r\n<br />\r\nShooter - Strategy RTS <br />\r\n<br />\r\n# HIGHLIGHTS #<br />\r\n- new vr game concept that switches between first-person perspective and the third person mode to get to the goal.<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n- orkana combines strategy and shooter and smal puzzles and is interesting for both strategy and non-strategy players. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- 5 missions with 7-10 hours of gameplay at difficulty &quot;normal&quot; each mission representing a territory to conquer and can be played in 1. and 3. person mode. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- play side by side with your army, directing fire at you when attacking enemy buildings or clusters of tanks to protect your soldiers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- typical basic setup of a rts building game with base, houses, barracks, vehicle factory, tech-center, defense facility....<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- build tanks, soldiers, various vehicles and face the mutant orcs, enemy vehicles and creatures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- action elements for first person mode like energie weapons, vr hands interactions, switches, grenades, bombs to help the army.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- play orkana in 3 difficulty levels, &quot;normal&quot; and for very experienced commanders in &quot;medium&quot; or &quot;hard&quot;, so you can play much longer than 7-10h.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- ministory that is advanced during the missions by subtle hints in exploring the game world or mission description.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- with increasing level Orkana offers in each mission new units , new enemies , new buildings , new items. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- if there is enough interest, additional missions or game modes or Orkana Conflict 2 are possible in the future.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- game in English and German<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory:<br />\r\nWe are in a distant future and you take the role of a commander of the Earth fleet.<br />\r\nDeployed on the planet Orkana, we are ordered to mine raw materials and secure the territory.<br />\r\nIn the beginning it becomes clear that the planet is not abandoned and that an evil force has control over the living creatures.<br />\r\nIt seems obvious that the conquest of the territories will be prevented by an aggressive enemy.<br />\r\nIt will therefore be your task, as commander of the force, to bring this enemy to its knees and bring the planet and its resources into the hands of humanity.<br />\r\nDecide the Conflict on Orkana for us and conquer the planet for humanity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay:<br />\r\nOrkana Conflict VR combines and connects the typical &quot;3rd person perspective&quot; with the &quot;first person perspective&quot; for the first time.<br />\r\nYou mine resources, create various buildings and units like in a typical RTS game, and command them from the air.<br />\r\nBut then you also have to play actively in the first-person mode and remove obstacles, help your army fight and find a way to defeat the aggressive enemy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOrkana Conflict does not want to create the depth of a full RTS game.<br />\r\nThere is no deeper upgrade system or hours of base building or mass battles with hundreds of units.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInstead, the focus is on a small 20-25 stong army that should be used tactically smart to overcome the obstacles together with the player and win the territory of the enemy for themselves. Can you force the enemy to his knees ?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\nOrkana Conflict is a one man project and was developed by me. The total development time was almost 2.5 years. Hope you have fun.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote for Windows Mixed Reality Headsets users : please check the discussions for current support status.Thank you :)",
