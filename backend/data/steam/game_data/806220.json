Since that was quite a while ago, I decided to offer the game for free to everyone. Please keep in mind that it was created in a different time - nevertheless, I think that it can still be quite fun to face the attacking alien horde in your space fighter. I hope some of you still has some fun hours with it ;-)<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/806220/extras/5b9c69f4f7882fe6d7d88667a7b1684e.webp?t=1726318582\" width=610 height=20 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/806220/extras/c1d280a412343fd3da443f16351818b3.webp?t=1726318582\" width=610 height=50 /></span><br><strong>About the game</strong><br><br>You are an ace pilot and mankind's last hope.
