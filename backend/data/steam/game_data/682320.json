    "description": "<i>You are being chased by evil toys in an old black and white film...</i><br><br>Witchkin is a first person 'hide and sneak' horror game in the vein of Slender or Five Nights at Freddie's. <br><br>The player takes the role of a 9-year old boy attempting to find his abducted little sister in an abandoned Texas farmhouse in the early 1900's. This house is home to the Witchkin--a family of terrifying toys, the children of a deranged woman known as the Candy Lady. Using her “children”, she will do everything in her power to keep all who enter the house from ever leaving.<br><br>Witchkin boasts a very strong and unique art style reminiscent of early silent movies, painted in the eerie sepia tones of post-mortem photos and the murky shadows of nightmares.",
