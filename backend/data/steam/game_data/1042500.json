    "description": "VAST™ is an anime-flavored sci-fantasy action adventure first person shooter about a misfit team of cosmic treasure hunters, in way over their heads!  Join the Aces High Gang aboard their starship captained by cat Michu, piloted by hot-shot jockey Yori, guided by exo-archeologist Jasper, and protected by security cyborg and player character Enzo.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVAST™ combines JRPG elements with the FPS genre to create a unique and fresh hybrid game.  A colorful cast of fun characters and enemies fill sprawling non-linear level designs to encourage exploration and adventure.  Twisting and explosive enemy deaths leave behind ammo for multiple arm cannon weapon types.  Voice-acted character dialogue and terminals of text and image provide an even deeper layer of discovery, and episodes are driven by mystery towards finding cosmic treasure before hordes of alien enemies can first!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCampaign Levels are released Episodically over time as free updates.  Campaign &quot;The Frozen Star&quot; Episode 1 &quot;The Star on No Map&quot; is now included!",
