    "description": "After finally plucking up the courage, you – the nameless protagonist – <br />\r\nasked your school classmate out on a date. Her name was Penny Black, <br />\r\na girl slightly shorter than most girls her age, with short black hair <br />\r\nand bright blue eyes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo your surprise, she accepted your proposal! The meeting point was just <br />\r\noutside the Soma Cinema Complex, Saturday at eleven o’clock. This is where <br />\r\nyour little adventure… or misadventure begins…<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-\tPenny Black plays similar to a traditional text adventure; type in certain words in order to progress the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-\tMore than 25,000 words.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-\t30 minutes – 2 hours game time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-\tDifferent endings that are determined throughout certain choices.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-\tHidden choices that could either spell success or disaster.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-\tA massive 200kb to install!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeep in mind that there is no save function, but it is relatively straightforward enough to remember the choices you made and progress through the story quickly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPenny Black is just a simple game I made in my spare time using BBC Basic for Windows. Though nothing special, I see it as a small step towards making better programs in the future.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHope you enjoy the game!",
