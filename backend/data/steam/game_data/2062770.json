By drawing heavy inspiration from <strong>Streets of Rogue</strong> and other roguelites, the player can do what they want, how they want. Complete quests, conduct trades, gain levels, use abilities, steal weapons, all while trying to <strong>survive in a world that reacts to itself, and you.</strong><br><br>Win the game by taking the Crown, through any way you can. Use the overwhelming strength of a warrior, the shadowy stealth of an assassin, the smooth words of a bard, or even the spells of a witch or wizard to seize the Crown. The choice is yours on how you want to play.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2062770/extras/f0244218ec6e534c6f84d329220ab033.avif?t=1670425664\" width=620 height=80 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Play as <strong>any class you want</strong>.
