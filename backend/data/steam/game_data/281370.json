    "description": "Urban myths  are stories that may or may not have been believed to be true. Unlike most, some are actually based on real events. One of them, takes place in a haunted forest, near a cemetery, on the borders of a city, near you. Many consider this place dangerous late at night, because there are things happening that nobody knows of or wants to know.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReal Horror Stories is a point and click horror adventure. The goal of the game is to clear each level. At first it may seem easy but the choices are not always what they seem. You will need to find the right combination of objects to click in order to proceed. Along the way you will encounter puzzles that you need to solve in order to advance to the next level. However, once you understand the gameplay , ghosts , demons and monsters jump out of nowhere to take or scare you! The game is very creepy, especially if you try to play it at night. You will definitely get into the mood immediately. Turn the lights off, put on your headphones and try it...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n• The Ultimate edition of the popular internet game<br />\r\n• All levels altered for the most terrifying experience<br />\r\n• Even more jumpscares!<br />\r\n• Graphics updated to HD<br />\r\n• 17 levels / 6 NEW horror puzzles<br />\r\n• New alternative ending<br />\r\n• Additional help guide (red spot)<br />\r\n• Tips/Support document included",
