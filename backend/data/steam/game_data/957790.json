How is the player base, are there many real players?<br><br>There is a very active core player base and a good overall base of real players, but on off-peak hours the real-player numbers will be smaller.  Anytime is a great time to play War Dust to practice and earn XP. These peak-player hours are when the most real players are on the battlefield.<br><br>M-F<br>2 PM EST-11 PM EST<br>This is 8 PM-5 AM CET time zone.<br><br>Sat &amp; Sun<br>12 PM-12 AM EST<br>That is 6 PM-6 AM CET time Zone.<br><br>Weekend Events have the highest real player counts of the week:<br>Every Saturday and Sunday<br>3-4 PM EST<br>9-10 PM CET<br>8-9 PM BST <br><br>2. Is the game updated regularly or is it abandoned?<br><br>Starting with the player-developed major update on May 20, 2022 the game has been continually updated with small and regular updates.  There is continuous work being done on the game files to add new features, new maps, fix bugs, optimization, and polishing.  This is an ongoing player-led effort.<br><br>3. How is War Dust different from other VR shooters?  What sets it apart?<br><br>The size and scope of the huge 32v32 battles is unique.  Movement options like paragliding, flying and driving vehicles and squad-based spawning allow players to maneuver quickly across these large areas to hunt enemies and capture control points. War Dust is not a milsim game, it is arcade style.  The primary goal is balanced and fast gameplay, not realism. Although, many players who prefer realism have embraced the fun of War Dust for the gameplay and fast action combat. <br><br>4. Are there bots in the game?<br><br>Yes, every match on Official Rotation will have 64 soldiers (real players or bots), bots will fill in the spaces that real players do not fill.  Modded servers can be set with whatever number of bots is desired per side.   The server network is set to cap at 46 real players per server room, with 18 bots, for a total of 64 soldiers. After Room1 is filled with 46 real players, a second server room is created, and so on. Every real player adds a heavy load to the network, so it has taken much network optimization to combine 46 real players with 18 bots and have surprisingly smooth performance.<br><br>5. What is locomotion like?  What options for moving and turning?<br><br>There are 3 locomotion options: thumbstick, pro-loco and fitrun.  Thumbstick is basic non-dominant hand free locomotion. Pro-loco is like throwing yourself around the world using the top controller buttons. Fitrun is like jogging or bobbing in place to run in the game. Locomotion can be controller or headset directed as set in game options. There is smooth or snap turning.  You can play standing up or sitting down.<br><br>6.  Does War Dust work on Quest2?  <br><br>Yes, using virtual desktop.  The experience will vary based on individual setups, but many Quest2 owners play War Dust currently.<br><br>7. How buggy is the game? Is it Janky?<br><br>War Dust has come a long way over its lifetime and many bugs have been fixed.  Also, the worst jankiness has been polished, but some players have continued to point out issues that they notice.  Some of these are actually features of War Dust and won't likely change, but some of them are issues that we want to improve or fix.  The list is long and with that effort there will sometimes be new bugs, or some things might not work as expected. Let us know on the discord so we can add them to the list. We are listening.  <br><br>8. What is War Dust Playtest?<br><br>If you request access, you will be added as an owner of our Steam Playtest App. When we're ready for testers to playtest, we will open the War Dust Playtest game to be installed and tested by the testing community (to install click the “play now” button on the playtest section of the War Dust store page)..  This may be the newest build of War Dust or may be an experimental build.  Testers may play in the same server or a different server from the main game, depending on our testing needs.  It is an opportunity for owners of War Dust or non-owners to participate in testing to make the game better.<br><br>9. What about gunplay?  How does it work?<br><br>War Dust is an arcade game, so the guns are not developed to be completely realistic. There is some recoil and spread on all guns, but not as much as there would be in real life. The way guns are loaded and spent mags removed, etc. uses the grab button to physically remove and load, not by use of buttons to press and have the action performed by the game. Weapons are held around the waist in a virtual belt area that can be customized with each spawn and returns to default after death.<br><br>10. How realistic is War Dust compared to other milsims?<br><br>Wardust is an arcade-style milsim that focuses on fast-paced, action-packed gameplay over strict realism. Unlike realistic milsims, Wardust is designed to be more accessible and less punishing for players, often featuring simpler controls and mechanics that are easier to pick up and play.<br><br>Wardust prioritizes the player's enjoyment and entertainment over strict adherence to real-world military tactics and strategies. It often includes exaggerated or over-the-top elements, such as powerful weapons or vehicles, and may allow for more individualistic play styles instead of strict adherence to teamwork and coordination.<br><br>While Wardust may be less realistic than other milsims, it can still provide an exciting and immersive experience for players. It features large-scale battles with impressive visual effects and explosive action, and is a great option for those looking for a fun, action-packed military simulation without the steep learning curve of a more realistic milsim.",
