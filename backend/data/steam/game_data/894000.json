Pets are dreams consumed by the darkness including bats, dogs, nests, and more.<br>Dev Note: <i>I plan on adding at least one pet each month of 2019 for Night of the Blood Moon, and am looking forward to getting more creative with more time on my hands.</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Eclipse Mode</h2>This mode lets you start with nothing, and get stronger until you the engine can't keep up. There are currently no limitations.<br>Buy health, ammo, and unleash a  flurry of weapons. Eclipse Mode is my way of letting you destroy the game I worked so hard to build whilst having absolute fun.<br><br><strong>For Non-Ubuntu Linux users: </strong>GameMaker (the engine used) only supports 32-bit graphics for some reason (which Ubuntu supports out of box). From what I've come to understand here are the required fixes:<br>install lib32-openssl or openssl:i386 (depend of your system), and Properties -&gt; Set launch options and LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. %command%<br><br><i>Night of the Blood Moon is a game I am incredibly proud of, and excited to share with everyone. Above all I hope you are challenged in a fun and enjoyable way. I'm looking forward to seeing you kick Night of the Blood Moon's butt. Good luck, and have fun.</i><br>-Tyler McDermott, creator and sole developer of Night of the Blood Moon<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/894000/extras/3c23ec450358e9656e4e16c87f721309.avif?t=1596836800\" width=616 height=180 /></span>",
