    "description": "The Hunted is our homage to the classic arcade gun games from Namco (Time Crisis) and Sega (House of the Dead).<br />\r\nIt's dark, moody and immersive with full on fire fights, an 'on the rails' story, shoot, duck to take cover, reload, stand and shoot.<br />\r\nBuilt only for VR it's what VR deserves.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Team<br />\r\nWe have a very long history in games, we have worked on just about every platform at some point and on most genres of game, we've managed to get ourselves into the lucky position of being able to make games for ourselves and make the games we want to play, we are very passionate about gaming and VR.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Story<br />\r\nA mash up of The Fugitive, Rambo, X-Files and all good popcorn films.<br />\r\nYou play a decorated war veteran suffering PTSD and wrongfully accused of the murder of your wife and child. <br />\r\nOn the run you must survive long enough to prove your innocence.<br />\r\nBut in the background is something much darker, is it really PTSD or something far more supernatural?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCurrently<br />\r\nFollowing the update the game now has approx. 1 hour of a story mode, 4 arcade levels with leaderboards.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWishlist<br />\r\nWe have an extensive wishlist for future updates but we welcome your feedback.<br />\r\nA very small part of the wishlist:<br />\r\nMultiple weapons including grenades and rocket launchers (of course!).<br />\r\nMultiple locations and themes.<br />\r\nStory Mode.<br />\r\nSteamworks SDK support for achievements as a minimum.<br />\r\nVehicles - tanks, helicopters, jeeps, etc.<br />\r\nDestructible scenery and interaction with scenery.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUpdates<br />\r\nWe will work hard to keep you updated on progress and communicate what's coming and when, part of that process will be reviewing comments and doing our best to incorporate them into future builds.",
