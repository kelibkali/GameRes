    "description": "You have become trapped in space amongst the remnants of a disintegrated starship and must navigate your way to safety.<br><br>In this game there are platforms which all have their own gravity. Blue platforms have gravity pulling towards them and red platforms have anti gravity which pushes the player character and some physics objects away from them. The game is played from a 3d third person perspective. The goal is to navigate to the exit teleporter by solving the puzzles involving changing the direction of gravity using switches and a gun which will reverse the direction of gravity when fired at the platform.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Reverse gravity using your gravgun<br></li><li> Solve the puzzles to find your way to the teleporter<br></li><li>change the position of the platforms to effectively clear the levels</li></ul>",
