    "description": "<strong>WHAT?</strong> <i>tanxy</i> is a game where you can program. In contrast to other games where you control your Units with keyboard and mouse, in <i>tanxy</i> you can write a <i>JavaScript</i> program to control any Unit on your behalf. Although manual control is also possible. Your goal is to destroy all enemy Units and to keep yours.<br><br><strong>WHY?</strong> <i>JavaScript</i> is the most popular programming language on this planet. If you have a kid who should be motivated to learn programming, <i>tanxy</i> could be a good option. If you are a programmer who wants to learn <i>JavaScript</i> with fun, <i>tanxy</i> is an option, too.<br><br><strong>HOW?</strong> You develop Tank control algorithms, you implement them in <i>JavaScript</i>, load them to Tanks and see how they fight.",
