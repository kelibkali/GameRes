    "description": "The <strong>Red Bull Rookies Cup</strong> is a category that accompanies the MotoGP™ at 7 races during the international championship. It was set up with the aim of training younger riders, and giving the most talented an opportunity to take part in the MotoGP™ championship. Launched in 2007, the programme originally assigned each of the rookies a KTM RC 125, substituted in 2013 by the KTM RC 250 R. A lot of the younger riders currently racing in the MotoGP™ championship got their start in this category: it's an excellent way to learn how to race on real circuits, and perfect for honing your riding skills.<br><br>With this additional category, you'll be able to recreate the entire career arc of a MotoGP™ rider: get on your KTM RC 250 R, and take on the youngest, and boldest riders, whose vigour makes these fiercely fought races among the most compelling confrontations on the tracks.<br><br>(Bikes and Riders from the DLC can be used in offline and online Grand Prix, Championship, Time Attack, and Split Times modes)",
