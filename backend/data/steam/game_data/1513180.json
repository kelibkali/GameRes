    "description": "The goal of this game was to create a chill peaceful environment for hanging out and studying in VR. Engage in TV and radio entertainment with others around the world while listening to live Lofi synced between each other.  It's a perfect place to come sit down for a moment and use any vr overlay software or even the steamvr built in one to surf the web or get caught up on work in the idle lounge upstairs. The servers are on 24/7. Remember to be nice to others in the community, we are all passionate about VR and share that in common.",
