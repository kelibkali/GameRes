    "description": "The floor is lava! Relive your childhood dream-races around the house in this fast-paced, action-packed arcade racing game.<br><br>Crazy Wheels is a fast-paced, action-packed arcade racing game. Over a decade ago, I was in the Virgin Megastore in London with my family. Looking through the store aisles for games, we stumbled across 2 isolated machines running a new car game: Micromachine V2 Turbo. The machines were free, so my brother and I decided to give it a try. By the time we finished, a line-up of people had formed behind us waiting for their turn to play. Ever since, our love for the game has been unconditional: we picked it up and played it repeatedly over the years, giving us some unforgettable multiplayer memories.<br><br>After this amazing experience, we played a few other excellent arcade racers, like Ignition and Revolt, to name my favorites. Crazy Wheels was born from the memories of these gaming sessions and the intense fun it provided us, with 4 people playing on the same keyboard.<br><br>If you also fondly remember this golden age of racing games, then Crazy Wheels is for you! It aims to bring you back to those fun moments and intense races, all while adding its own unique elements.<br><br> <br><br><strong>About this game</strong><br>Collect and customize 20 different vehicles, and race around a wide variety of dynamic environments such as the kitchen, bathroom, garden, and kid’s room (the kid didn’t clean…). Use makeshift magazine-ramps and ironing board-jump pads to get around the jam-packed (literally) maps, avoiding the slippery ketchup stains, the sticky eggs, and much more! Master five unique game modes such as the classic arcade and time trial modes, or the unique and action-packed stalk the ball or stay visible game modes.<br><br>Pick up and use a wide variety of powers to get an edge on your opponents, including the shockwave, mine, electrocutor, and many more!<br><br>Race up to 4 human players, in split screen, local play, online, or a mix of these modes, either in teams or free-for-all.<br><br>Crazy Wheels, will also come with an integrated level editor, because the modding community is very important and will ensure that the fun will never stop.<br><br> <br><br><strong>Gameplay features</strong><br>– Up to 4 human players split screen or on the same screen for more intense action<br><br>– Treacherous tracks in the Bathroom, Kitchen, Bedroom, or Campground, filled with everyday household items<br><br>– Various game modes, allowing racers to play in either split screen or on the same screen<br><br>– Various unique power-ups (Speed, mines, push away, zappers, missiles and more)<br><br>– Free-for-all or Team games with power-ups for each occasion<br><br>– Single, Local, and Online multiplayer<br><br>– Multi-platform: Windows, Mac, Linux and other possible consoles after release<br><br>– An integrated level editor giving you creative control of your own maps where you can race your friends<br><br>Controller support note: You will only need a Keyboard/Mouse when using the level editor. Other than the game fully supports controllers.",
