    "description": "Ray's the Dead lets players command a zombie army through a distinctly '80s-flavored adventure to solve the mystery of how Ray died. The soundtrack ranges from '80s power ballads and synthwave to jazzy club tunes and traditional orchestral score. Clocking in at over two and a half hours, there's a lot to love with additional music by Jeff Jelen, Kirk Syrek, Beat Plastic, SATORI IN BED, and A Space Love Adventure.",
