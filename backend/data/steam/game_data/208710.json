    "description": "Colour Bind is a physics platform-puzzler set in an abstract world where gravity is determined not by mass, but by colour. Navigate this unique world by manipulating colour and gravity to solve each level. Beating each unique puzzle in Colour Bind will take patience, intelligence, quick reflexes and sometimes even a helping hand from a friend.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A true challenge: Over 50 unique puzzles with multiple solutions will keep you platforming for a long time. This game is hard. Early-90's hard. Don't be afraid to step back and think.<br></li><li>Colour-based physics: Change your colour and manipulate each level's gravity to solve every puzzle. Primary colours have different gravities applied to them, and when combined form a secondary colour that takes the vector sum of that gravity.<br></li><li>A world of secrets: Take your time to explore every level. There’s a world of hidden solutions, distractions, and more to discover.
