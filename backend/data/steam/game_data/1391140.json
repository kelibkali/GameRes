    "description": "The official soundtrack to <i><strong>BroodStar</strong></i>!<br><br>BroodStar is a classic arcade shoot’em up with heavy roguelike elements. Careful, though... the vastness of space contains many formidable enemies. If you fall along the way, you have to start over — the only thing you’ll bring with you are the upgrade modules you collected in your past runs, in the form of research points that augment your ship. Will they be enough to get you through hordes of unknown creatures and monstrous bosses, and fulfill your quest of defeating the living planet — the BroodStar?<br><br>(Music is subject to change as the game is in early access and more stages could be added with time.)",
