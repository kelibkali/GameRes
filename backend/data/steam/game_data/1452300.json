The snake have a symbol on it's head. So does the fruits. When you eat a fruit representing the opposite symbol (the one you have advantage on) the snake size does not change. The same symbol will make it grow by 1 piece. The disadvantage one will make the snake grow by 3 pieces instead. So you need to proper calculate your moves!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1452300/extras/7c51ca3687fe32a7c4aa5a7ca08eb3f3.webp?t=1681998531\" width=600 height=58 /></span><br><br>Minimalist visuals, multiple beautiful backgrounds, uplifting music will make you calm.
