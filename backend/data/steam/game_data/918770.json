    "description": "Whoa... You're here... You... You're considering owning the soundtrack? Like, every song I wrote for this game? Well... Since you're curious, I love you for it, and I want to tell you what you'll be getting.<br />\r\nLevel 1: Let It Roar<br />\r\nLevel 2: The Fang Shards<br />\r\nLevel 3: Poseidon<br />\r\nLevel 4: Drowning<br />\r\nLevel 5: Cave Busting<br />\r\nLevel 6: Shiver<br />\r\nLevel 7: The Chase<br />\r\nLevel 8: Derelict<br />\r\nLevel 9: Fruitless<br />\r\nLevel 10: Graduation<br />\r\nLevel 11: The Amazon<br />\r\nBoss 1: Wolf Head<br />\r\nBoss 2: Sucktion Muck<br />\r\nBoss 3: Bass Zombie<br />\r\nBoss 4: Shiver<br />\r\nBoss 5: Nightmare Droid<br />\r\nBoss 6: BumbleWasp<br />\r\nMain Menu Theme<br />\r\nAmazonian Exposition<br />\r\nAnniversary<br />\r\nUrgency<br />\r\nEnding Credits<br />\r\nThorough Inspection<br />\r\nCommunity Service<br />\r\nI would highly recommend attempting the appropriate booty-shaking and dance moves for each track. Every file is WAV format, and you have a solid hour of music to chill to... Or create stuff to... Or do any kind of work to... Or... Well, it'll be your copy of the soundtrack, so just do what makes you happy that doesn't annoy people with my music. Love is in each track, as well as heart and soul.",
