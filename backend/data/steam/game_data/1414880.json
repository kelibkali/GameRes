    "description": "Colonize Mars and help your settlement to survive on the Red Planet! <br><br>The Farlanders is a turn-based strategy game in which you have to build and manage a colony on Mars. Use specialized tools to terraform the planet, build residential areas, create resource producing factories, and don’t forget to have entertainment centers for your citizens. At the end of the day, their happiness is paramount!<br><br>Perfect your skills and optimize the creation of your colony using terraforming tools. Incorrect usage might lead to devastating results. <br><br><strong>Main Features: </strong><br><br>Puzzle-like terraforming system <br>Use a turn to select one “terraforming kit” to shape the landscape and get it ready for your colony. Place a water drop title in a canyon to create a water source while being careful how the other tiles around it are being affected.  Not only will you need mountains for turbines, flat tiles adjacent to water for furtail soil, you need to make sure that the ground is something you can even build on.<br><br>Buildings<br>Create the habitat for your settlers by placing necessary buildings for their survival, like farms, water pumps, wind turbines, and more. Build factories to supply your colony and have entertainment centers to keep your colony the premiere place to live.<br><br>Research &amp; Law System <br>Constantly evolve your colony by researching new technologies and implementing different laws to increase the productivity of your colony. <br><br>Compete with other players <br>Create the most efficient colony on Mars and show off your score. The leaderboard is updated on a daily basis and you will get a chance to place your name on a top of that list! But can you stay there?<br><br>Procedural map generation<br>Each new game will feel completely different with procedural map generation, yet still customizable to meet your desired level of challenge. <br><br>Customized Maps<br>Want a little more control over the maps? Customize the Red planet the way you want. Add more water or remove it completely, add more hills to produce more energy using wind turbines or if you like the solar panels more, decrease the frequency of hills appearing on the map. <br><br>Trading<br>Trade with other planets and colonies in order to ensure the success of your mission on Mars.",
