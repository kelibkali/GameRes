Keep adding poses until you create a full movie that solves the level.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/726880/extras/4350ece033b337cced6ac968b2c918db.avif?t=1561955734\" width=600 height=74 /></span><br>Each level poses a challenge that you have to overcome. For this, you need to create animations that vary in length. From short and simple animations on the first levels to complex and long movies in the last levels.<br><br>Since you'll be creating an entire animation, you'll have complete control of which part of the movie you want to modify. Pause the movie at any point, and add a pose. A pose is just like a keyframe, so the character knows that it has to reach that pose in that specific moment.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/726880/extras/fb1debd6336b3bce593346eff20d2bb5.avif?t=1561955734\" width=582 height=68 /></span><br><br>After a pose has been created, move the character's limbs to any position. You may go for stylish movements, ninja movements, or whatever works for you! When you pose the character a projection will let you know what will happen in the near future. Use that projection to find the right movement.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/726880/extras/634fee78056cafa7128d18ac468867fe.avif?t=1561955734\" width=548 height=274 /></span><br><br>If you are happy with it, move on! You can add as many a poses as you need. All levels require you to build a full animation to solve them.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/726880/extras/458ef99c25e28289cc47ae9561b60fd2.avif?t=1561955734\" width=594 height=176 /></span><br><br>Control up to three characters at once collaborating to solve the levels.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/726880/extras/8ab967b938e8050079dd9ac1d826994c.avif?t=1561955734\" width=572 height=322 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/726880/extras/5d0ad04697b8590d0769f0f749780a67.avif?t=1561955734\" width=600 height=74 /></span><br>Yes! I'm including the level editor I used for the game. So hopefully we can create a community that shares levels and challenges with each other. TEST",
