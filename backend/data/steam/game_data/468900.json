    "description": "Want to make art for isometric strategy games or RPGs? Good at MilkShape 3D or not able afford a modelling tool like 3D Studio Max or unable to master it? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is the solution! Just import your 3D models and this tool will export all animations to sprites from all 8 sides. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, this tool is a complete convex hull modelling program. What exactly are convex hulls? They are the basic building blocks for architecture (buildings and scenery) in first person shooter level editors. Some games that use convex hulls (also called &quot;brushes&quot;) include: <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Quake <br />\r\n- Doom <br />\r\n- Counter-Strike <br />\r\n- Half-Life <br />\r\n- Call of Duty <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, everything uses bump maps in this tool. You can even customize the shader program that renders the 3D models and convex hulls. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can save your scenes for editing later. You can customize the rendering parameters, like angle (allowing you to achieve any axonometric projection besides isometric), game tile width in pixels, and light position.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdjust number of sides, whether you want 6 DOF, whether you want terrain inclines, and whether you want depth maps exported.",
