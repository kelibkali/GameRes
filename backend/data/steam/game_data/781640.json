    "description": "Run Jump Fail puts you in control of the hapless HappyMan, and tasks you with guiding him through a whole load of treacherous obstacle courses. You'll fail a lot along the way, but watching HappyMan collapse and flail when he's just run into a wall, or tripped on a ledge, or been hit by a big red spinning thing is a lot of fun.<br><br>Seriously, failing is 90% of the fun. So fail away.<br><br>The game is a 3D platformer that's dead simple to pick up and play in short bursts, so if you need a break from grinding away at the latest 50 hour epic RPG and fancy a spot of fun filled action, look no further.<br><br>Obligatory feature list:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Unique physics based 3D platforming action.</li><li>Ragdolls!</li><li>50+ obstacle courses, and more on the way.</li><li>Minigames.</li><li>Sandbox playgrounds.</li><li>HappyMan! (he's just the best)</li></ul>",
