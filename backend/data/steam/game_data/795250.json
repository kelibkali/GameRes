    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Beasts of Legend: Coldwood Codex</strong></h2><strong>A fantastical bestiary of fey and undead!</strong><br>This supplement contains 10 creatures suitable for use in any campaign set within or traveling through the cold, desolate woods of the northern wilds. While ideally suited for adventure paths like Kingbreaker or the Witches of Winter, these creatures add a delightful bit of novel menace equally split between fey spirits bursting with the raw and wild energies of life and vile undead seething with the power of death. Drawing upon real-world folklore, classic fantasy tropes, and the design skills of two of the top creative minds in the business, the Coldwood Codex is an indispensable addition to any GMs monster toolkit. This 35-page monster product includes inventive mechanics for creatures from CR 2 to CR 18, complete with pages of detailed lore and ecology, full-page color player-friendly handout portraits, and foldable paper miniatures for every creature!<br>This is not the first monster product that Legendary Games has produced, and it will certainly not be the last. The Construct Codex for our Gothic Adventure Path Plug-Ins has been lavished with praise for its quality and inventiveness, and we hope to bring you many more chapters in our ongoing Beasts of Legend series that will equal or exceed it. The Legendary Games tradition is to combine rich story and background, innovative layout, beautiful aesthetics, and excellence in design that is second to none. This product is the latest in that tradition, and we hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed making it, and that youll keep coming back again and again to Make Your Game Legendary!<br><strong>Requirements:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included Pathfinder ruleset.<br><i>Conversion by:</i> <strong>Perry Chalmers</strong><br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Perry Chalmers</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included Pathfinder RPG and D&amp;D 3.5/ OGL ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
