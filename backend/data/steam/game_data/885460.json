    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >En5ider: Give Chase</h2><i>Chase scenes never works at the table like the ones in the movies.</i><br><i>In your mind, they're action-packed and thrilling,, but in reality, they're a tedious slog which grinds your game to a halt.</i><br><i>They're the reason you cringe when your players decide to pursue those fleeing goblins.</i><br>Adding to the chase rules found in the core rulebooks, this article presents an abstract way of mapping a chase, along with three new complication tables for underground, castle grounds, and mountain chases.<br><i>By</i><br><strong>James Introcaso</strong><br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>David Brown</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included 5E Compatible ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
