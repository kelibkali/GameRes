    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\">In Pelican Deep, you're late for convent school and hoping the nuns will go easy on you. Piece together the truth of what's really happening within the confines of the church and face familiar fears that have been hiding dormant. Remember your prayers, expose residual conversations, and navigate the disturbing choices presented to you. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\">Designed to be played in one 35-45 minute session, but depends on how much you explore and will save your game if you need to jump off early. Single-player. First-person. Features original soundtrack.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\">As you continue through your school day, you will follow the nuns' orders as they become progressively more ominous and questionable. This may lead you to places you were never meant to see... or perhaps never meant to return to. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4313980/extras/e7dfb85bf3a1f491c90c695be3aec9c4.avif?t=1771393017\" width=451 height=346 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\">Fear and uncertainty fester at the forefront of the human condition, inherited through a gene drip and learned unwittingly from those claiming to guide us. Rituals, whether in faith or psychological struggle, provide fleeting relief, but ultimately perpetuate a cycle of dread and repetition. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4313980/extras/6b7406d548adaece93e74d14e4ef70cd.avif?t=1771393017\" width=489 height=335 /></span>​</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\">These subconscious codes are like heirlooms passed down and shrouded in morality and love. After generations of rehearsals, will you be able to break the loop, or will you succumb to the familial blueprint you were designed to act out?</p>",
