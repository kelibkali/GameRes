Providing devastating power at range, it could end a battle before a single sword was swung. Comes with an explosive arrow and a poison arrow choice.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/401650/extras/5d3a56b913a3488d2d4a633ebb5f5ff6.avif?t=1755875189\" width=628 height=180 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >•\t<strong>Throwable Javelin</strong> – With its origins lost in murky pre-history, the javelin is a simple weapon. After all, it's a thrown stick with a pointy end that ruins someone's day. Despite this simplicity, it still requires skill and strength to use.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/401650/extras/a9dda1c387f054a072f6fb0c3984e625.avif?t=1755875189\" width=628 height=180 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >•\t<strong>Light Crossbow</strong> – The crossbow was a game-changer on the battlefield. It was simple in its design, cheap in its construction and powerful enough to punch through a knight's plate armor.
