    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Doc Braun's time-machine has crashed in a cave - but where, and <strong><i>when</i></strong><i>?</i> Play as Julius, an erudite and sardonic English art student, to get the two out of this unfortunate situation.   <br>   <br>The situation being; they're on an island of cows. Like, cow-people. With clothes, and American accents. And also there's one human chick who's probably into grimecore.    <br>   <br>This comedy adventure game borrows from the Lucasarts games of the mid-90's, like Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road, Monkey Island, and Grim Fandango -- meaning you don't have to worry about dying (well except in Grim Fandango), and are free to enjoy the adventure.<br><br>The control system lets you easily investigate every object and interogate (nicely) every character, so you have plenty of room to think, and not click all day. With a specially composed (by human, not AI) soundtrack, lush sound-effects, and large cinemographs and detailed backgrounds,you will feel immersed and at home in the environment; which is good, because about 10 minutes in you meet a talking horse, so if we hadn't taken this much care...</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >With an easy, (mostly) linear narrative, and lots of humour and moon-logic puzzling, Lost on Cow Island will have you lmao-ing for 5 hours - towards an ending you never saw coming!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p>",
