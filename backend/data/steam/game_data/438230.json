    "description": "A child reaches for the stars, burdened by circumstance. Folks chained by debt, indentured to the powers at large. Mankind thrust to the stars following after a signal spanning the void of space and time itself. Take a seat and settle into the universe of Ira where the space age coincides with the 1930's depression era.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/438230/extras/0db9730ada32f27aef4aa3793a34d596.avif?t=1554730488\" width=678 height=126 /></span><br><br>A man lost in time and in mind, Ira stands on the brink of the unknown. He wakes aboard a desolate ghost ship on the outskirts of an alien solar system, lost and alone, his memories stripped away. His own life is a mystery to him, returning in flashes, and the only sensation of familiarity comes from this alien place. Its secrets feel like words on the tip of his tongue and its presence feels like home. But home was a forgotten, far away place<br><br>His youth returns first, visions of a life marked by poverty in the shadow of a world ruled by a mega corporation and its spectacles of science. Its crowning achievement was an interstellar vessel, the Holocene, a global initiative coated in promises of prosperity, but driven by secretive motives.<br><br>This vessel that carried him, this ship that called itself the Holocene II, it was the apparent successor to the ship of his boyhood wonderment. But why was here there now? Its crew all dead, its captain a strangely sentient navigation computer, it was Ira’s only hand hold to life.<br><br>On it he ventures into the depths of the Lithic System, a place proving itself to be more than just another star. Its wonders drew the gaze of scientists, tempted the greed of the ruling class, but for Ira it distorts his perception, and gently whispers the promise of hope.<br><br>He follows in the wake of the first crew, the idols of his youth, and finds a path that undid them. What force could swallow the largest craft ever known and outwit its most brilliant minds?<br><br>But this place invites Ira, beckoning from the center of the system, guiding him over the solemn ruins of a once budding research colony. His journey reveals not only what lies ahead, but also what forces called to him in his youth, and still call today.<br><br>Walk this path from unsteady beginnings towards uncertain ends. Relive the past and make the choices that guide Ira from the son of a poor farmer to a man on the brink of the unknown. Come face to face with the forces that called to him across the void of space and time.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/438230/extras/d09ceced024432be128ae77cf14be1eb.avif?t=1554730488\" width=678 height=126 /></span><br><br>Use point-and-click mechanics to navigate through a world of intimate 3D spaces as well as serene, minimalist landscapes. Allow a creeping tension to build in an immersive world as you explore alien landscapes, relive past events, and watch as the nature of reality becomes porous and untrustworthy.<br><br>Playing through multiple timelines, your choices can have far reaching effects as you interact with and play as a colorful cast of characters, guiding their way through a fateful set of circumstances. Choices you make determine your relationship with other characters, who will be present for certain events in the story, and can even determine the fate of certain individuals. Combining our choice system with our multiple timelines will yield interesting outcomes, as making choices in retrospect can change what Ira will find in the Lithic System. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/438230/extras/c3255e9b795c4f808d701e677223da1d.avif?t=1554730488\" width=678 height=126 /></span><br><br>Learn about a rich and deep alternate timeline where knowledge and expansion as a planet took precedent over war and petty differences. Nations realized the potential for technological innovation and rallied to push science and engineering to its limits, thrusting humanity into the space-age in the early 20th century.<br><br>The great inventors of the era were the heroes of society, and an excitement for the progress of mankind surged over the Earth. But greed and inequality were only nurtured by these leaps of advancement, ever widening the gap between the rich and the laboring classes.<br><br>This is the world Ira knows, but what lies beyond the bounds of Earth and Mars? A star looms just within reach, a place that draws the attention of both corporations and willful adventurers. Its nature unlike anything seen before, calling into question all that is known about our world, and about our very selves. The universe of Ira is a strange and wonderful place, full of complexity and surprising elegance. But don’t wait to experience the Ira universe; new pieces of Lore will be released every few days, allowing you to get a head start in immersing yourself into the world that could have been.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/438230/extras/d3fbc6213abb3319f2113153b8c3e482.avif?t=1554730488\" width=678 height=126 /></span><br><br>Music will act as a guide as you navigate Ira’s world. Within Ira’s alternative history arises the folk music of those far from home in Martian mines, and the plight of a people left behind by the space faring few. This music will play the interludes of the story, carrying you across the various timelines in surreal transitions across time and space. Inspired by Appalachian mountain music and the blues of the Mississippi delta region, the soundtrack of early rural America is turned on its head when given a surreal treatment. Deep, airy ambiance fills the space between pensive banjo notes, mandolin chords echo into oblivion. The result is a feeling that connects the farms of Earth and the vast expanse of space, a feeling that is alien, yet familiar.",
