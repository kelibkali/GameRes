The game is bringing a modern touch to the authentic roguelike experience. Your character is a new comer to a procedurally generated island full of dungeons, quests, curiosities and adventure. Once you step foot on the island, you decide where to go on this open world and meet challenges along the way. <br><br>The enemies are varied and require different tactics to deal with. The encounters, quests, loots, battlefields, dungeons are all random. The settlements prosper, live on, or decline, and your actions have an effect on them directly or indirectly.<br><br>You will fight your way through your own emergent story, and gain experience, gold and fame, while you discover the ancient evils that threaten the island.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1120400/extras/0022df3de4ae12f06e81f00bd6590192.avif?t=1749041050\" width=600 height=122 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Procedurally generated open world<br></li><li>Four different map creation options: landmass, moderate, fragmented, archipelago<br></li><li>Create large maps for epic games<br></li><li>Turn-based tactical combat system in an authentic roguelike fashion<br></li><li>Procedurally generating the quests, items, NPCs, battlemaps and dungeons<br></li><li>Potion crafting<br></li><li>Cooking<br></li><li>Fishing<br></li><li>40 enemy types with three or four tiers each, totaling to 120+ enemies, including the Furious Fungus, Ratman Claw Master and Phantom Sailors <br></li><li>Influence the world with your actions.
