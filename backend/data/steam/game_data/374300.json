She boasts more Five Diamond hotels than any other city in the world. Her shine and sparkle attracts tens of millions of dreamers every year. Dreamers that are ready to drop their mortgage on the slots and tables of the casinos. And no casino shines brighter than the Golden Grin. It also comes with the CAVITY 9mm rifle, 4 casino themed masks, patterns, materials and 5 achievements.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2>•\t<strong>Introducing the Golden Grin Casino heist</strong> – Funded with foreign investment, the Golden Grin broke ground in '45, and saw its first guests roll the dice early in '46. It quickly gained a reputation as a place where all appetites were satisfied. Crooked games, sex parties, and violence for hire. It made international headlines with the infamous Thanksgiving Massacre in '57. By the 60's, its name was a deserved byword for Vegas' darker, deadlier and seedier side. All the greats have made their name in the City of Sin. Make yours at the Golden Grin.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/374300/extras/42ef250b4639b68dd3d81608356ae6df.avif?t=1756113762\" width=628 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>1 new rifle</strong> – An additional rifle called the CAVITY 9mm is added to the game.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/374300/extras/6800ebf64a7aa81f7167770fc2197ca3.avif?t=1756113762\" width=628 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>3 weapon modifications</strong> – The CAVITY 9mm comes with 3 new weapon modifications.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/374300/extras/f805135aa1b78b0b2d71c171b6f261ae.avif?t=1756113762\" width=628 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>4 new melee weapons</strong> – A series of new melee weapons inspired by the casino scenery have been added to the game.
