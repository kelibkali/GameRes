Only he is able to get the universe back in sync and close the portals once and for all!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay:<br />\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />\r\nTouch the monsters with your wands to grab them. <br />\r\nOnce a monster is attached to your wand shoot them into the correct portal -- matches their colour -- to earn points and build up your combo. <br />\r\nFire a monster into the wrong portal and your combo will end.
