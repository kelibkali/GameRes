It doesn’t provide any damage but increases the health and armor of the Captain. On top of this it provides a trait called Shield Block that reduces incoming ranged damage.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Sacred Relic Armor (Armor)</strong><br><br>\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Sacred Relic armor has low-to-medium armor rating but provides the Space Marine with a lot more melee offense. After all, the best defense is to just kill your opponent before he attacks you. It grants two traits which are Crushing Blows and Melee Expert. Crushing Blows causes any melee attack from the Space Marine to do area of effect damage, and Melee Expert bumps his melee damage by 15%.",
