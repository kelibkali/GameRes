Throughout the game, players will pilot a remote operated Rig as they explore Horizon, a high-tech complex that has mysteriously gone dark.<br><br>The Aperture is home to many strange phenomena, the deadliest of which takes the form of the Corruption. As equipment and power sources are left exposed within the Aperture, mutations begin to take place. Material is gradually taken over by the Corruption and transformed into monstrous bio-mechanical creatures. Both intelligent and incredibly lethal, the Corrupted pose the biggest threat to operations within the Aperture, and need to be dealt with extreme caution.<br><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/405190/extras/7deca32728064ae95e5bb8b7d0e8fb44.webp?t=1506010787\" width=616 height=39 /></span><br><br>As a freelancer, you will be remotely conducting operations within the Probability Aperture via the Rig, one of the most advanced military vehicles ever developed. Recent improvements have eliminated the need for pilots to physically operate the vehicle, and now all functionality can be controlled remotely, with visuals being transmitted by a small drone that closely follows the vehicle at all times.<br><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/405190/extras/779071785d299222fbd09cec387c1854.webp?t=1506010787\" width=616 height=39 /></span><br><br>The Rig is an incredibly versatile vehicle, capable of being modified to suit the needs of any particular encounter. Three weapons can be simultaneously mounted along with one defensive module chosen from a pool of nine unique and completely upgradeable parts. Making sure the Rig is outfitted and fully prepared for the dangers that reside within the Horizon facility is a key component to survival.<br><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/405190/extras/5498f68544f1ffd952456ca84a546944.webp?t=1506010787\" width=616 height=39 /></span><br><br> The latest in a line of Multi-function Extraction and Gathering units, MEG is a dependable robot tasked with assisting remote operators with tasks that they are unable to perform with just the Rig. MEG allows the player to interact with a wide variety of access points within Horizon, whether it be opening doors or even hacking basic machinery.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/405190/extras/bedc9722aed948a52624aec8fd70d424.webp?t=1506010787\" width=616 height=39 /></span><br><br>Salvage destroyed hostiles for important resources that can be used to construct deployable defences. The Rig can build sentry guns, proximity mines, and energy walls, which are instrumental in securing areas and holding back hordes of hostiles.
