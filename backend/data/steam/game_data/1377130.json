    "description": "Floor 13: Deep State is a dynamically generated dystopian thriller, inspired by the 90’s classic Floor 13 and created by its original team. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a free society, citizens make their own decisions, can challenge authority, and are able to speak their truth. Your job is to put a stop to that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReturn to the elusive 13th floor in a London you think you know, wielding your resources and the power of the pen to redefine “the truth.” Fake news, illegal surveillance, assassination - it doesn’t matter how you get the job done, all you need to do is sign the order. At the helm of the machinery of the deep state, you will encounter characters and events inspired by today’s political climate. It is up to you to uphold the status quo.",
