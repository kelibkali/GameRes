Either alone or with a group, make artful monstrosities!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Make &quot;Art&quot; with your Friends</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Scrap Pack is all about making something &quot;wonderful&quot; out of garbage. Embark on a road trip with the rest of the pack, funded solely off of the profit from selling your trash art. Each person is responsible for making an art piece at every stop. If you don't have enough to continue, it's definitely because everyone else's art pieces sucked.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Rummage for Your Materials</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Rummage around procedurally-generated towns for trash (or other people's belongings) that you want to use to make a (probably not) fantastic sculpture! Anything is up for grabs, assuming you can get your hands on it. Be aware - the local's tastes are going to be changing every day, so if you want to keep moving you'll need to adapt!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Explore each Town</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >As you continue on your trip, you'll stop by a large assortment of procedurally generated towns to explore. Some of these areas might be pretty normal. . . and some might not. Why'd we come here, again? Remember - each town is going to have different types of trash to find, so plan your route accordingly!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Auction Your Art</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Every night, each person's art gets set up for auction at the local auction hall. How much it sells for is up to a combination of what objects were used to make it, whether your friends think you did a good job, and the whims of the local art enthusiasts (and they'll make sure to let you know how they feel).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Upgrade Yourself</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >All money in Scrap Pack is shared, which means you can spend everyone's else's profit on yourself! Want an upgrade that will increase the value of your own art? How about something to make you jump higher? How about just a nice hat and a new set of shoes? Don't worry - they won't (will) mind.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Cosmetics</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Find or buy new clothing to put on in later trips!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Best with Friends</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Scrap Pack can be played single or multiplayer, but really is going to be best with a group of people you like hanging out with. It's a nice blend of being silly and trying your best, and at the end, at least you have some art to remember.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Features</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Play with up to 5 friends</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Communicate through proximity chat</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Procedurally generated towns to explore</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Tons of different pieces of trash to use on your art</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Singleplayer mode</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Character customization</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >More to come!
