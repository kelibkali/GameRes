    "description": "In Fatty Rabbit Hole, you're a rabbit falling down a hole, eating as much junk food as possible. Chowing down on disgusting healthy food, like vegetables, turns your stomach - and if you puke, you'll lose progress toward completing the round - so try not to blow chunks!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>2 game modes</strong> - Endless mode, where rounds are chosen at random and the game lasts until you wipe out, and Limited mode, a more level playing field with a pre-determined order in which to play each round.<br></li><li><strong>12 unique rounds</strong> - A variety of levels containing an assortment of obstacles and enemies make each game feel different from the last, and offers a unique challenge every time you play.<br></li><li><strong>3 boss rounds</strong> - As you venture further down the rabbit hole, you'll encounter boss rounds which present special trials with multiple levels of complexity.<br></li><li><strong>4 bonus rounds</strong> - Played mid-level, each bonus round offers the chance to pick up massive amounts of bonus points.<br></li><li><strong>12 seasonal games</strong> - Every month, a special seasonal game is available to play. Each comes with unique challenges, and only Fatty Rabbit Hole experts will survive the longest!<br></li><li><strong>Full controller and touch support</strong> - Play how you like with full support for Xbox controllers (or similar) and touch screens.<br></li><li><strong>Fully hand drawn art</strong> - Every image in Fatty Rabbit Hole was hand-drawn and digitally painted to ensure a high quality, fun cartoon look.<br></li><li><strong>Legendary cartoon sound</strong> -  A classical score and sound effects lifted from traditional cartoons makes the game feel like a cartoon come to life.<br></li><li><strong>Your platform, your language</strong> -  Fatty Rabbit Hole is available on PC for Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu, and includes language options for English, Spanish, German, and French.<br></li><li><strong>Inspired by comedy genius</strong> - Fatty Rabbit Hole was inspired by the comedic work of Matt Donnelly and Paul Mattingly, who produce the podcast Matt &amp; Mattingly's Ice Cream Social.
