Blast your enemies, collect some coin, upgrade your ball, and chase your (and the leaderboard’s) high score... all while huffing that sweet 80’s nostalgia. Expect a difficult score chasing arcade game.<br><br>Why &quot;The Real&quot;? Laser Ball is a pretty rad name, and an accurate description. However, the game took a little longer to make than planned and someone else snagged the name. &quot;Laser Sphere&quot;, &quot;Laser Orb&quot;, &quot;Bally Laser Firey PEW PEW&quot; just didn't have the same ring to it. So, I took a page out of Ghosbuster's book and it became &quot;The Real Laser Ball&quot;. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/785590/extras/0380f293243bfb6bcf512a6e0ea3b630.poster.avif?t=1587855854\" width=616 height=54 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/785590/extras/0380f293243bfb6bcf512a6e0ea3b630.webm?t=1587855854\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/785590/extras/0380f293243bfb6bcf512a6e0ea3b630.mp4?t=1587855854\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You control a ball.
