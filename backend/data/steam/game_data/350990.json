    "description": "In a small village in central Europe something is happening, the forest growing around has something different. Its wood is red color,  unique in the world. This does not pass unnoticed to the world's largest logging company, the White Wood Company, which does not hesitate to send their best expert to take over the exploitation rights. But what apparently seemed a routine work, will become a horrible nightmare when the man of the company begins to investigate the dark past of the village.",
