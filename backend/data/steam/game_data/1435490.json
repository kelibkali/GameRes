But in the reclusive village of Homaran, a tentative peace is sustained amongst its people.<br><br>Eir lives simply with her guardian; her life plain but fulfilling. Until he is brutally murdered at the hands of the Caelki, a dark sect who live in service to disorder and the worship of an insatiable god, long since forgotten to legend, much like the origins of the crystals Eathral has come to so desperately rely on.<br><br>With her closest companion and unrequited inamorata, Kira at her heel and a mysterious book written in a language she does not understand, Eir sets out on a quest to find answers that will reshape her destiny and change everything she knows about who she thought she was. Taking refuge in the hands of her allies and a planetary ancestral power that roots itself deeper within her than even she knows, Eir must learn to wield the might of Eathral herself in this tale of magical discovery, devotion, betrayal, and adventure.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong><u>Heart Of Eir Features Highlights:</u></strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Magical Affinity Interaction System<br></li><li>Active Turn-Based Combat <br></li><li>Multiplayer CCG Card Game<br></li><li>Complex Puzzles and Dungeons<br></li><li>Mining and Weapons Upgrade System<br></li><li>Mounts and Fast Travel Abilities<br></li><li>Open World Exploration<br></li><li>Build your own unique House and Village<br></li><li>Fishing and Farming</li></ul><br>Heart of Eir is a game that is sure to captivate you and keep you playing over and over again.
