    "description": "Riftwalker is a rogue-like tower defense in a world consumed by darkness, featuring rich backstory and endless, detailed procedural levels. You play the role of a riftwalker in a scouting party sent to investigate a nearby missing star, but find more than you were expecting - a civilization, or rather, what's left of it. It's your job to find out what happened and make sure the threat never spreads to your world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2>Tower Defense like you've never seen before! Riftwalker takes the ambitious aim to redefine the genre.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">      <li> Rich procedural maps that develop as you progress through the game.<br>     </li><li> A deep backstory that begs to be pieced together, delivered in bite-sized fragments.*<br>     </li><li> Stunning visuals, that break free of the traditional mold surrounding tower defense games.<br>     </li><li> Full 3D camera control, get close to the action with full 3D camera controls, allowing you to really be a part of the action.<br>     </li><li> A large upgrade tree that you build as you play the game, allowing your towers to follow your playstyle.*<br>     </li><li> Incredible music track that really helps immerse the player in the world of Riftwalker.</li></ul><br><br><br>* Early access notes, some features will become available post-release and are subject to change. I'm being open with the community as I don't want to disappoint anyone. The story is almost complete, however, I will only be introducing the story fragments once I've polished up the game-play some more and released the upgrade tree as they will integrate with the upgrade tree. In the meantime, there are clues to the story everywhere - without going into specific detail. The environment is being designed with the story in mind. I hope you decide to be a part of the community and help shape the future of this incredible game.",
