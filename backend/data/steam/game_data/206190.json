    "description": "Gunpoint is a stealth puzzle game that lets you rewire its levels to trick people. You play a freelance spy who takes jobs from his clients to break into high security buildings and steal sensitive data.<br><br>To get past security, you'll need to make creative use of your main gadget: the Crosslink. It lets you see how all the security devices in a level are wired up, and then you can just click and drag with the mouse to wire them differently. So you can connect a lightswitch to a trapdoor, then flick it when a guard walks across to make him fall through.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Rewire levels to work however you want<br></li><li> Trick guards into trapping themselves or shooting each other<br></li><li> Throw yourself - and others - through plate glass windows<br></li><li> Investigate a noir-inspired story of murder and espionage over 20 missions<br></li><li> Choose what to tell your clients, including lying to trick them<br></li><li> Choose your own playstyle: quick, quiet, non-violent, no living witnesses, or any combination<br></li><li> Discover new solutions to levels that no-one else has thought of<br></li><li> Buy specialist gadgets to suit how you want to play<br></li><li> All story stuff is skippable<br></li><li> Hardest puzzles are optional<br></li><li> No bosses - everyone dies in one shot, including you</li></ul>",
