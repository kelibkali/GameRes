    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >STORY</h2><br>In 2194 humanity has populated the entire galaxy. As our existence expanded, crime became harder and harder to control in the vast reaches of space. As a result, laws became more strict. Government attempts to wrangle the issue bolstered a growing police force and, over many years, the reach of law enforcement grew larger and more aggressive. The general population, simply wanting to feel safe, grew more accepting and the first fully commercially run prison systems took form.<br><br>Nearly one hundred years later, in 2290 imprisonment is commonplace. A blind trust has been placed in the commercial justice system eventually landing everyday people in jail for years for even the smallest offenses creating a massive divide between the idea of prisoner and person.  Hundreds of commercial prisons and law enforcement companies thrive.<br><br>Devaluing of prisoner lives and massive prison overpopulation gave birth to an auction system where anyone could purchase prisoners for any use free of legal ramifications.<br><br>Acquired in the most recent bulk order of prisoners for BioMass Labs, you are being shuttled off for study at the Kohate testing facilities. No information is known about the details of the study.<br><br>You have been black-bagged, loaded onto a transport shuttle, and are waiting for law enforcement to release you to the company.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >THE GAME</h2><br>The subject is a sci-fi puzzle game designed to combine a mix of classic puzzle adventure games with horror elements and visual aesthetics of early 80s sci-fi.<br><br>You will need to learn to navigate the complex to find your way to the various testing rooms set out in the experiment and collect items needed to progress through the maze.<br><br>You are being monitored by those running the tests and are required to visit a bio-data terminal periodically to record your vital signs and other data for record keeping. If you fail to do so, you will be removed from testing by euthanization.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Puzzles<br></li><li>Collection<br></li><li>Casual Mode<br></li><li>Twitch Integration<br></li><li>Stealth<br></li><li>Survival</li></ul>",
