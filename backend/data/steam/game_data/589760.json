You can buy or sell cars and components, fix and tweak your car to make it the fastest around.

Each connected to each-others and they are working together as a car. In this game, every car is built up from dozens of individual components, connected to each-other the same way as in reality. Each component can be removed, replaced and swapped between other cars. This way, you can not only customise your paint work and outlook, but the handling and performance of the car as well.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Understand your car!</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Watch your car when driving, how is it handling, how smoky is it or what noise coming from the hood. All these can help you to identify the real problem.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You need a 4x4 but you don’t have the budget? Buy a wreck cheap car and transfer it to a 4x4 supercharged racing beast, using wrecked cars and used components from the newspaper.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You engine is strong, but your car don’t reach the speed you want it to? Make sure your gears and differential also match with your goals!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Racing and what is behind it</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >In the reality, racing is about 80% mechanical work, 19% testing and 1% racing. In this game, we try to get closer to this, while we still wanted to keep the fun. If you like cars, if you do understand that a car is not only about 4 wheels, 1 motor and a steering wheel, if you don’t afraid of mistakes, if you dare to challenge others, even when you are with your most loved car, then Welcome in Noordu, the land of Revheads!</p>",
