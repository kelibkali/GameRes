    "description": "Taking place in a tank suspended in a cosmic wonderland, five axolotls appear one day from a mysterious, thundering void. They quickly learn they are able to speak with one another, and relationships are formed. However, something is off. Each axolotl seems to possess knowledge they should not know. Foods, and people, and places and concepts...<br><br>And obsessions. <br><br>Some feel a lot of pain. Some want to inflict pain. Some want to forget pain...  <br><br>And who is this [RB] person that keeps appearing, anyway?  <br><br>Take in some mystery, some science fiction, some action, and some character drama, add in a pinch of the authors personal reflections of pain, anxieties and depression, and this is what you get. Surely, there are many things that can be said, but RB: Axolotl is unlike anything you’ve ever seen before.<br><br>Despite its cute art style,<strong> RB: Axolotl is intended for mature audiences only.</strong>",
