    "description": "Welcome to Fade Out, our first classical escape room experience, developed for virtual reality devices. In this game, there are no zombies or monsters, just different puzzles of variable complexity.<br>Our goal with Fade Out is to experiment with this gaming genre and to bring an escape room to the player's living room.<br>One riddle follows another, as one room keeps mutating in other forms - small steps on your road to the main question.  Do you think it is possible to escape?<br>Fade Out is a single player virtual reality game, available for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.<br>If your actual room is small, or if you prefer playing the game sitting on the sofa, you can use the built-in teleport system. The game is violence-free and although it is based in unsetting environments, it can be played by gamers of any age.<br>Fade Out is created by a very small and multicultural team from different countries (5 countries for 10 people).<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1054310/extras/5c29dc60912487645eb1ab32592c349b.poster.avif?t=1698840650\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1054310/extras/5c29dc60912487645eb1ab32592c349b.webm?t=1698840650\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1054310/extras/5c29dc60912487645eb1ab32592c349b.mp4?t=1698840650\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >SEVEN GOOD REASONS TO PLAY FADE OUT</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>HTC Vive and Oculus Rift(soon):</strong> the best HMDs for the best gaming experiences</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Six Degrees of Freedom:</strong> explore every detail, touch everything, look everywhere</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Real first-person experience:</strong> you and the room</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Walk or teleport:</strong> for every room size (and lazy developers)</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Violence free:</strong> mystery and suspense for everybody</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Creepy soundtrack:</strong> composed by the darkest Finnish composer</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Puzzles of growing difficulty:</strong> do not be tricked if you think in the beginning that it's too easy</li></ul>",
