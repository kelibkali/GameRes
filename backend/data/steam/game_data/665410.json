    "description": "Square Box: a game with the ball falling in a box.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou have twenty maps to complete the game.<br />\r\nEach map is a box that rotates in the sky.<br />\r\nThe player controls the box not the ball.<br />\r\nYou can rotate the box to the right or to the left and you can overturn the box.<br />\r\nIf you use the &quot;reversal&quot; command the kinetic forces are canceled and the ball changes trajectory.<br />\r\nOn each map you will find small yellow boxes, these will give you the green arrow to move to the next map.<br />\r\nYou will also find obstacles, for example you will never have to touch black balls or gears.<br />\r\nTo protect you, you can use shields, or you can change your position with the white ball (instant swap).<br />\r\nYou can also use the rings to push the black balls away.<br />\r\nYou will need to use the intelligence more than the instinct and you will need quick reflections and a lot of patience.<br />\r\nGood fun!",
