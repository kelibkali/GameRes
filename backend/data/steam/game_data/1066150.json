Pass skyscrapers and drive through the daily rush hour in the midst of the city. Over 500 buildings and objects especially developed for Düsseldorf make the city a detailed extension for OMSI 2.<br><br>The addon is constantly being updated by chrono events. On top of that, due to random events, there is always variety on the map even during longer play times.
