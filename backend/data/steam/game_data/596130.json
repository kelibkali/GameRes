    "description": "C&amp;C C2 Shades of Mist<br>A Castles &amp; Crusades Adventure module for Fantasy Grounds<br>Upon the slopes of the long bluff of Lorettas Agony lie the ruins of Aliegor. Long<br>ago devotees of the Og-Aust, the Frog Gods, lived here. And their religious house<br>thrived like no other. It bore the fruit of wealth and the knowledge of the world<br>before the turmoil of war and plague. But that was before even the coming of the<br>kings and the rule of the bastard gods. Now beneath the shades of the willow trees,<br>along the course of the Mistbanes tributaries only the shadows of memories remain.<br>Beyond the long line that is Lorettas Bluff lies the deep and mournful Millorian.<br>Here ancient trees tower over the fertile earth, their roots deep and old. Elves<br>have dwelt here for years without count and have made the wood a wondrous if altogether<br>dangerous place. But of late the Bowlgaar Orcs have grown in power and war is brewing<br>in the forest deeps. For the Bowlgaar are driven by the Paths of Umbra, a mendicant<br>and wild wizard who sees in them a tool for his greater power. For he desires what<br>few believe even exist, and he knows that in the deeps of the Millorian lie the<br>ruined powers of the Og-Aust.<br>But shadows overcome all and the banks of mist that dwell upon the currents of the<br>Mistbane make all things in these deep reaches twisted and shades of themselves.<br>And still the stain of the winter dark lies here to and other powers linger from<br>beyond.<br>Plunge into the deeps of the Darkenfold and explore the mysteries beyond the green.<br>Here your worthy arms can explore the ruins of Alice and the temple of Aliegor.<br>Beyond the heights is the country of the wild elves, and the ancient woods where<br>lizard men trade with dwarves and orcs wage a deadly if silent war beneath the green<br>eves. Follow the course of the Mistbane and unravel the riddle of the Willow and<br>see into the realm of the dead.<br>To live in these eves is to move like a ghost to join all others that are nothing<br>more than Shades in the Mist.<br><strong>Requirements: </strong>The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the Castles<br>&amp; Crusades ruleset.<br><strong>Conversion by:</strong> Alan Neilson<br>The reproduction of material from within this product for the purposes of personal<br>or corporate profit, by file, photographic, optical, electronic, or other media<br>or methods of storage and retrieval, is prohibited.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>John Dziadek</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Castles &amp; Crusades ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
