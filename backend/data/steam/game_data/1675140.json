Following your recent discoveries, you have mastered Time and intend to use it to find the cause of your loved ones' disappearance. You will explore your old home, a typical American household from the 1950s, and also discover an alternate, altered and corrupted version of it. <br><br>As you travel between these two eras, you'll have to figure out what happened and solve the mystery that surrounds your home. Yet in the midst of these two very oppressive universes, you sense that your experiments have lured a rather unusual guest.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>About</strong></h2><br>Reminiscence is a psychological horror narrative game for one player made on Unity.

You will travel between these two epochs and discover that even your environment is toying with you.<br><br>The player uses a watch to travel between 2 eras and alter the state of some objects. While exploring his environment, he'll have to solve puzzles to progress. Numerous scripted events, as well as a detailed narration, will give the player a unique experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2><br>The character can go back in time and explore the house of the time. The character can travel between two eras: the post-apocalyptic present and the 1950s past.<br><br>The Rollback mechanic allows the player to take an object back in time.
