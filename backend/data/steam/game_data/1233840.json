Razmi is discouraged by Ajna's continued success but is determined to make Ajna look foolish, so keeps coming up with new absurd challenges. As the player continues, other fan-favorite characters tell Razmi that it is getting to be too much, which Razmi stubbornly ignores.<br> <br>As we reach the conclusion, Razmi starts to feel bad about it because Ajna is having a tough time but she's in too deep to tell Ajna it was all a ruse. When the player finishes all the challenges, Razmi will actually go to the bother of rustling up a present, but Ajna will reveal she figured it out a while ago, isn't that dumb and knows there's no reward, but it was fun training together. Razmi says she’ll keep the reward to herself. Ajna insists on receiving whatever it is.<br><br>●\tMissions are gated by players’ current story progress. These will be spread across the game for players starting from early on, with new sets of challenges unlocked at points in the story where they learn new abilities.<br>●\tDLC will begin for players on a new save file once they have added Razmi to the party.<br><br>Thanks for your support, <br>505 Games team",
