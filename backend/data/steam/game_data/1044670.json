    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Lightning Artist lets you draw frame-by-frame animation in VR and save your work to continue in Blender or another supported desktop creation app. It's part of a complete pipeline for hand-drawn volumetric animation—a common exchange file format, a set of ML models, and plugins to integrate 3D drawings into a wide range of XR projects. Readable in any popular 3D graphics application and ready to use in real-world production scenarios, its goal is to make creation in 3D as expressive and intuitive as drawing in 2D.</p>",
