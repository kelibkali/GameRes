    "description": "2D pixel-art platformer/shooter based on Mexican folklore and ridiculous stereotypical jokes and innuendos, all in good fun!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInspired by the great platformers and shooters from the Arcade era with comic relief.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou play as El Pansas which roughly translates to *&quot;the big belly one&quot;. The term is normally used for big beer belly men in Mexico for having... you guessed it! Big bellies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGo through levels and eliminate iconic joke-related enemies.<br />\r\nCollect Tequila bottles for power-ups.<br />\r\nEnjoy some crazy mix of Mariachi style music with Metal and even popular tunes while keeping that caliente flavor feel for the game.",
