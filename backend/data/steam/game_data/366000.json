    "description": "<strong>** Added by publisher: Development is currently on-hold. As detailed in a Steam community forum post in 2018, the one-man development person suffered a head injury and is yet to return to working on Rogue System. Obviously a purchase at this time is for the experience as it currently stands. **</strong><br><br>Rogue System's goal is to depict the possibilities of space exploration and combat within a realistic environment--choosing not to ignore the &quot;science&quot; in science-fiction. Key features do/will include proper orbital mechanics for all objects in space; detailed ship system control, functionality, inter-dependency and damage reaction; and the ability to move freely from one ship to another, EVA, and effect repairs while in flight.<br><br>Rogue System’s Core Module (CM) will be a complete campaign-driven sim on its own. It utilizes both dynamic as well as scripted missions to allow for greater replay-ability while telling an intriguing story.<br><br>Finally, Rogue System is fully moddable, allowing both DCI as well as the sim’s community to add new ships, missions, and even campaigns.<br><br>Later, Extension Modules (EM) will add even more gameplay.",
