I love creating games that feature open worlds and that let me channel my creativity in unusual ways.<br>That's how I came up with the idea for L.S.D.<br>Since I'm all alone, sometimes I use some beautiful pre-made assets created by amazing artists that let their work be licensed online and I try to make the most out of them.<br><br>If you'd like to get notified about the game (and sales) at launch, make sure to put it in your wishlist!<br>Wishlisting L.S.D. is a great way to support me in creating the game of my dreams in a completely free way.<br><br>Feel free to contact me for feedback, advice and anything related to the project.",
