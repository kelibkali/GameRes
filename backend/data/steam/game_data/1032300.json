    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >World of Jordoba Player Guide</h2>The World of Jordoba is the masterpiece swords &amp; sorcery campaign setting written by ENNIE award-winning author Matt Finch.<br><i>Jordoba is an ancient world populated by strange peoples and stranger monsters, physically fraying into the depths of the oceanic multiverse. Ruination has spread across the world, and the civilizations of the Sea of Khoramandu are pushed back to the very coasts. And yet, humankind has risen from worse threats in the past eons of its existence. Scattered villages remain in the wildlands, and new barons carve out freeholds in the wilderness, their names scribed upon new maps. Great wizards make sorties into the very shadows beyond reality, seeking forgotten lore and undiscovered frontiers of arcane scholarship. It is a world where unnatural things survive from ancient times, where nameless gods have turned their unfathomable intentions, and where even civilized regions must literally be re-explored.</i><br><i>This is ... the Weirdling world of Jordoba!</i><br>Fantasy Ground adaptation includes:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Reference manual<br></li><li>Detailed maps linking back to the main text describing the region.</li></ul><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Michael Potter</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and any ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
