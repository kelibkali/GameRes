    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >BECOME A LEGEND.</h2>General Caius &quot;Coriolanus&quot; Martius is one of Rome's most feared warriors. So, you know, as this is a war story, that's gonna have a happy ending. As a war story in Shakespeare Times(tm), it will 100% have a happier ending than any other happy ending.<br><br>Yes, that's sarcasm.<br><br>Enemies are around every corner. Old vendettas lurk in every shadow. War is never over. Navigate Caius through this poorly-drawn (boy, that joke is really overused by now) visual novel of battle, betrayal, and choices that you have to make every so often that may or may not throw the story in a new direction. A direction that Shakespeare never intended. Scary, right? Total Death of the Author right here.<br><br>Navigate a weird lil' adventure game of war and more war, and sometimes politics. The politics of - wait for it:<br><br><strong>Modern Warfare</strong>.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> As Caius, the choices you make in how exactly to respond to certain situations may open up other paths down the road</li></ul><br>This is totally not a parody or a satire of anything.<br><br><strong>50% of all sales go towards the Wounded Warrior Project and Feast of Crispian.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About the Wounded Warrior Project</h2>Wounded Warrior Project is a charity and veterans service organization that offers a variety of programs, services and events for wounded veterans of the military.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About Feast of Crispian</h2>Feast Of Crispian is a non-profit organization that brings professional actors and veterans together to strengthen the emotional resources they need to overcome trauma and reintegration issues.",
