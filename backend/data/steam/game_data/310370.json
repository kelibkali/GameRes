    "description": "The Way of Life makes the player relive the same life's experiences from the point of view of three characters of different ages: an adult, an old man and a child.<br />\r\nThe experiences we want to tell about are very different, they go from a quarrel to a dream, and further to more serious topics like death and love. The main point about the game is that every experience will be told through different gameplay mechanics​.​ <br />\r\nAlso, every playable character has his own specific mechanics and a way to see the world.<br />\r\nThe player throughout the game can explore and live different stories and feel a variety of emotions in an amusing and captivating experience.",
