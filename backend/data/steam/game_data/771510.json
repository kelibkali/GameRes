    "description": "Hodl: The God of Crypto is an 80s inspired side scroller and arcade racer, featuring 3D graphics with VHS and CRT effects, and an original synth soundtrack. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne night, working late, Hodl: The God of Crypto teleports you to the Crypto Dimension. After making you an offer you can't resist, you have the power to move crypto currency prices as you move through the Crypto Dimension. All you have to do is get to the moon, sounds easy enough, right?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe whales will help you move the price higher and higher, but they will also help you understand the real purpose behind Hodl and his market manipulation scheme. Can you get to the bottom of it all?",
