If you want to experience the main storyline, head on over to Slime-san's page!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >History</h2><strong>Slime-san</strong> is the fourth major game developed by <strong>Fabraz</strong>. The three previous titles being <strong>Planet Diver</strong>, <strong>Cannon Crasha</strong> and <strong>Wild Wild Pixel</strong>. <strong>Slime-san</strong> is a game that is fun down to its very core. A silly story, with an unlikely character and gameplay that is addictively fast. It features hours of single player content yet is tailored for speed runners as well. The very core mechanics and level design lend themselves to be played competitively online. It is a visually unique adventure using a carefully crafted, 5 color palette world that is filled with fun and goofy Japanese references. It also has a soundtrack that is worth the price alone, featuring some of the most popular chiptune composers in the world! Published by <strong>Headup Games</strong>.",
