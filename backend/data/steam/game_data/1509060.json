You'll send them to explore the Caverns, lay waste to enemies, and loot treasures &amp; gear in a <strong>PvE idle dungeon crawler</strong>. When you're ready, you can go against other players in <strong>rolling 24-hour async  tournaments</strong> as well as <strong>live, manually controlled Arena matches</strong>.<br><br>Each of the 3 game mods has as submode for squads of 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 heroes. Glory, riches and bragging rights await the victors!  Level your team of heroes up with 11 different classes and <strong>8 mix-&amp;-match skill trees</strong>. You'll equip them with gear dropped by monsters, awarded for PvP tournaments, or granted by the gods. Let's take a deeper look at Dungeon Team's <strong>4 different game modes:</strong></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >  <strong>THE ARENA</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1509060/extras/3dbd56e73c40876efc75044bb7435493.poster.avif?t=1741009035\" width=620 height=412 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1509060/extras/3dbd56e73c40876efc75044bb7435493.webm?t=1741009035\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1509060/extras/3dbd56e73c40876efc75044bb7435493.mp4?t=1741009035\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Arena is the place where your heroes smash, shoot, stun, scare, bleed, poison, scorch, freeze, and shock their opponents into submission. It offers <strong>live PvP matches</strong> where you have direct control over your team in <strong>real-time </strong>– a little like a game of blitz chess. You will be rated and ranked on an Elo system to ensure <strong>fair matchmaking</strong>. And defeating human enemies will get you better loot and more experience! </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>THE INN</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1509060/extras/fc3ad85ee37aad53621ccee863c3c157.poster.avif?t=1741009035\" width=620 height=412 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1509060/extras/fc3ad85ee37aad53621ccee863c3c157.webm?t=1741009035\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1509060/extras/fc3ad85ee37aad53621ccee863c3c157.mp4?t=1741009035\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Inn is an <strong>asynchronous auto-battle  multiplayer</strong> game mode where you'll send your squads into battles with both parties <strong>controlled by AI</strong>. Players are organized into 24-hour tournaments where your goal is to gain as many peanuts as possible. Defeating an opponent's defense squad means stealing 10% of their peanut stash, as well as swapping tournament ranks with them (where higher ranks mean more passive peanut gains). If you gain enough peanuts you can rise to the next tournament tier, or maintain your tier. Lose out, however, and you could drop down in tier. Let's have a pint of ale, warm our feet by the fire and enjoy some nice trash talking in the<strong> in-game chat</strong> while watching our toons duke it out! </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>THE CAVERNS</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1509060/extras/dt_caverns_002.GIF?t=1741009035\" /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Caverns is an<strong> idle dungeon crawler </strong>where your teams of heroes explore a procedurally generated dungeon in search of treasure and fame. You’ll fight incrementally tougher enemies the deeper you go. Caverns is perfect for leaving on in the background while you work, study, or play other games. Many players even leave it running overnight and claim their loot and XP in the morning!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>THE TEMPLE</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This sacred site has just been found, and its secrets are still to be unveiled. <strong>Pray and offer sacrifices</strong> to earn the blessings of the gods!  </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Join our Discord server ~</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >... where heroes meet to discuss strategies and builds, lick their wounds, issue challenges and just have a great time together!</p>",
