The D&amp;D Adventurers League is the official organized play system for DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS. Players can create characters and participate in any adventure allowed as a part of the D&amp;D Adventurers League. As they adventure, players track their characters' experience, treasure, and other rewards, and can take those characters through other adventures that will continue their story.<br>D&amp;D Adventurers League play is broken up into storyline seasons. When players create characters, they attach those characters to a storyline season, which determines what rules they're allowed to use to create and advance their characters.
