Together, they managed to contact her <strong>long-lost fairy godmother</strong>. Surely, her powers would save her from this hellish fate. Kionna would be able to escape the castle, a prince charming would find her, and they would live <strong>happily ever after</strong>.<br><br>Alas, magic can only do so much. Things keep spinning out of control. Trapped in an <strong>endless nightmare</strong>, the princess ceaselessly rewinds time in a race with death itself. <strong>Is a happy ending truly waiting for her at the end of the tunnel?</strong><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1667530/extras/8efe7c4e20646200bdf0c2cffeea55a5.poster.avif?t=1697312684\" width=590 height=224 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1667530/extras/8efe7c4e20646200bdf0c2cffeea55a5.webm?t=1697312684\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1667530/extras/8efe7c4e20646200bdf0c2cffeea55a5.mp4?t=1697312684\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1667530/extras/dffcd5fb5acf11e4275db4dd60ce8b2d.avif?t=1697312684\" width=600 height=274 /></span><br><strong>Kionna</strong> perfectly encapsulates what you would expect from a fairytale princess.
