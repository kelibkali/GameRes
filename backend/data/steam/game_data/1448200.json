    "description": "Laser Skirmish is a Puzzle/Strategy game where you are the commander of a bunch of ships, and you have to figure out which ones to use to triumph over the enemy. The basic rules are simple, but within them is a lot of complexity as you figure out how to handle different ship types and deal with the enemies everpresent first player advantage. With 50 different levels and 12 different ships, there is a lot to figure out in how to plan your way to victory. <br />\r\nThe game is completely strategy based without any elements of luck, and completely free to play.",
