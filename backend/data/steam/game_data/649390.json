    "description": "DLC for the program RutonyChat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStarting the local server, which allows you to splite the stream into several streams of sites without re-encoding, from your computer. The only thing that is required is a broader Internet channel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe advantage is that you do not depend on the services of intermediaries, which under certain circumstances on their part, can cause problems until the broadcast falls.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIMPORTANT!<br />\r\nThe add-on requires a Windows 8 or 10 operating system, with the latest updates installed.<br />\r\nOn Windows 7, the performance depends heavily on the installed updates.",
