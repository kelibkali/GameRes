    "description": "In Collapse of Magic, you control the fate of four ordinary adventurers who find themselves thrust into the center of an ancient prophecy which tells of the impending Collapse. Fight your way across dozens of turn-based combat scenarios, in which you control your character's actions on the grid, and discover the secrets of the Ancients.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay</h2><br>Collapse of Magic bridges the gap between a turn based tactical game and a puzzle game. With minimal RNG, you must consider every move carefully. Should you use your powerful item now to barrel through the first group of enemies, or save it for those stronger enemies later on? Each battle offers its own challenge to overcome. To truly succeed, you must master your characters and their abilities, and learn how they can work together to take down powerful foes. The only one in charge of the fate of your characters is you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><br>Choose from one of six unique starting classes for each of your four characters. Each class plays very differently from each other, so you not only have to learn to master each class individually, but also learn how they can interact with each other, setting up powerful combos to take down even the most powerful of foes. <br><br>As you progress through the game, your characters will gain experience, allowing them to improve by unlocking new abilities and equipment. Branching ability trees means that even within each class, the decisions you make can drastically change how a character plays. Will your Rogue go down the path of evasive abilities, making them a hard-to-hit, tank-like unit, or do they go down the path of powerful but situational abilities? Or perhaps a bit of both?",
