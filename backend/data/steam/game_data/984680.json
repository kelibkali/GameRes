Explore other star systems remotely or by sending survey ships, and discover treasures and mysteries among the stars. Colonize new worlds, advance your space-faring society, both technologically and culturally, and engage enemies diplomatically or in tactical turn-based combat on your journey to becoming the ruler of the galaxy!<br><br>Interstellar Space: Genesis takes classic turn-based space 4X strategy mechanics, adds in a few twists of its own, and tosses them in with several brand-new mechanics to create a truly unique entry into the genre. It also aims to provide a lack of burdensome micromanagement and an emphasis on the best aspects of classic 4X space strategy games with the powerful &quot;just one more turn&quot; factor.<br><br>The game is in continuous active development since launch. Part of it includes free content updates, with free new features, improvements, bug fixes and balance changes for everyone. So, you can continue to enhance your gaming experience over time. Prepare yourself to embark on a journey of discovery of epic proportions!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/984680/extras/5ff9c858b561a8052ec1196a35f80eaf.poster.avif?t=1761828068\" width=610 height=124 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/984680/extras/5ff9c858b561a8052ec1196a35f80eaf.webm?t=1761828068\" type=\"video/webm;
