    "description": "Operation Defensive is a tower defense game but instead of monsters following a track, it's a player. So instead of watching enemies follow a track for no reason, watch them attack a player instead. But dont just stand there--fight back with towers! Towers dont really aim so much, so it's your job to lead enemies into your traps!<br />\r\nYou can play multiple different themes, all with unique different enemies and tower skins, and some with bosses.<br />\r\nIf you ever feel like the game is too difficult, there are settings for extra starting cash and a heal at the end of each round. Just know that these help settings don't work on bosses. And remember to have fun :D",
