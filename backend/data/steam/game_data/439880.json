These problems range from simple &quot;find a key&quot; to &quot;use magic powers to light all magic candles and open the magical gate&quot;. Different types of quests require different solutions. Use the skills of the characters in your party to complete these quests.<br><br><strong>Weapons</strong> - Your characters are your main weapons. The Elf shoots his arrows through multiple monsters, the Wizard has unlimited magic, the Warrior has a powerful melee attack with his hammer, and the Valkyrie besides having a quick spinning-melee attack can also detect secrets and important loot. The characters can level up to increase their firepower or find rare loot that enhances their character for short periods. This includes magic spells!<br><br><strong>Secrets</strong> - Find secret rooms, level-skipping teleports, secret items, and more!<br><br><strong>Perma-items</strong> - You will be able to unlock magic spells by collecting 4 shards of various magic books. Once all shards are collected the magic is unlocked. It's also possible to increase the strength of this magic by collecting the magic shards multiple times. All unlocked spells will stay unlocked even after you die, making you more powerful in your future attempts to reach the final boss.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/439880/extras/1f0ad13137834eb9d4694fd3d30ab3f0.poster.avif?t=1750784739\" width=612 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/439880/extras/1f0ad13137834eb9d4694fd3d30ab3f0.webm?t=1750784739\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/439880/extras/1f0ad13137834eb9d4694fd3d30ab3f0.mp4?t=1750784739\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
