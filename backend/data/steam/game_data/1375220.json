Game is about fighting against opponents with tanks using various weapons.<br>First player always play using keyboard where others can use joypads. Preferred are xbox pads. (Full support for all kinds of joypads is not guaranteed)<br>You can fight in teams (from 2 to 4 teams) or deathmatch.<br>Weapons are bullets, lasers and bombs.<br>Players can collect bounses with different effects.<br>To make tank temporary faster you have to press special button. Using speed depletes your energy bar.<br>Energy bar is also used for firing laser so you have to decide what is more beneficient for you: laser or speed.<br><strong>Beta online play.
