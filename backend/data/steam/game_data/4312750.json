    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Type the Rhythm is a <strong>rhythm typing trainer</strong> that teaches efficient touch typing technique through music-synchronized gameplay. Don't just practice two-finger typing harder and harder, <strong>unlock your pinkies and rewire your brain with our proprioceptive aid!</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4312750/extras/a7a2a278a4dbdf7214ea063f5bfc11b3.poster.avif?t=1772020840\" width=1170 height=342 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4312750/extras/a7a2a278a4dbdf7214ea063f5bfc11b3.webm?t=1772020840\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4312750/extras/a7a2a278a4dbdf7214ea063f5bfc11b3.mp4?t=1772020840\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Rhythm mode</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Words race toward you in a 3D space, synchronized to the beat. Like Guitar Hero or Beat Saber, but for your keyboard. Type each word as it lands—hit the timing window to keep your combo going and your score climbing.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The game shows you which finger should press each key, reinforcing correct 10-finger technique with every letter. It's difficult to fix bad habits when you're typing at full speed, and it's boring to practice when you're not being challenged. Rhythm-based gameplay keeps you engaged while slowing you down just enough to actually <i>change</i> your technique.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4312750/extras/f7a116f3ab75aeba16f7ad71883eeee8.poster.avif?t=1772020840\" width=1170 height=684 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4312750/extras/f7a116f3ab75aeba16f7ad71883eeee8.webm?t=1772020840\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4312750/extras/f7a116f3ab75aeba16f7ad71883eeee8.mp4?t=1772020840\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Pick your own style</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Have an injured finger? Prefer Dvorak or Colemak? Remap  letters and fingers however you see fit. Forget &quot;proper&quot; typing, we empower <i>efficient</i> typing. <strong>It's up to you to decide how to make the most of the fingers you've got.</strong></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Learn (or relearn) letters gradually</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Instead of throwing the whole keyboard at you, Type the Rhythm uses a progressive letter discovery system. You start with just your pinkies (Q, A, Z, P if you're on qwerty) and unlock more as you play. Every word you type is a real(ish) English word, matched to the rhythm <i>and</i> <i>melody</i> using a  layout and finger-aware dictionary system.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Freetype Mode</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Want to practice without the music? We also have a standalone typing trainer where you can work on your technique at your own pace without the pressure of rhythm, but still augmented with our per-finger cues.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>The Soundtrack</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Flow through a variety of genres,  everything from funk to folk, classical to R&amp;B trance. </p>",
