That was a hundred years before you were born.<br><br>They always said the Empress cast a long Shadow, and today the Shadow of a dark empire hangs over your head.

Your kind once served the empire as mindless automatons. But your mind and memories were returned to you by chance. Will you take this opportunity to <strong>get your mind back for good</strong>? Or will you succumb to the Hunger that whispers to you?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Kalevel</h2>You are Kalevel, an ancient demoness once despised by the immortal Empress. Now, long life has left you complacent. Will you see the signs of a new enemy <strong>before it is too late?</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Tell</h2><strong>You are Tell</strong>, a girl who wants desperately to leave a home plagued by memories of family tragedy. Unfortunately, your hunt for job in the city brings you smack up against that tragedy in the least likely of places.
