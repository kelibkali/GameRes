    "description": "It's a cool summer evening in 2009. You're about to sit down and play your favorite platformer,<i> Epic Rabousch! The Armenian Electrician</i>. But then, you hear those awful, awful words. From down the hall, your mother calls to you:<br><br>&quot;Sorry sweetie, but it's your little brother's turn on the controller. You can help him though!&quot;<br><br>Now you're going to have to sit and watch as the sniveling little brat lowers your average highscore that you've spent many months trying to raise. Maybe you could guide him in the right direction, if he'll only listen...<br><br>LITTLE BROTHER'S TURN is an infinite, procedurally generated platformer that takes a new twist on how you control the game... or rather, how you don't! You'll have to work with a delay as your brother takes time to complete your commands. It's platforming, but planning ahead. Your brother, being the brat he is, can also outright disobey you. But maybe there's something you can do about that...<br><br>How far can you make it before losing your temper?",
