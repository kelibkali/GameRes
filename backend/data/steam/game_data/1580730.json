    "description": "In November 2007, Freightliner announced Project Genesis (unrelated to GE's Genesis series built for Amtrak), a procurement plan for 30 freight locomotives from General Electric (GE). The locomotives ordered were intended to match older types in terms of haulage capacity whilst at the same time being more fuel-efficient. The project was a collaborative effort between Freightliner and GE, with input from drivers on the cab design. 3DZUG developed this modern British locomotive for TRS with the latest PBR techology. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- BR Class 70 Freightliner<br />\r\n- Nameplates (The Coal Society and Powerhaul)<br />\r\n- Running Numbers<br />\r\n- Realistic model and textures<br />\r\n- Realistic drivers cabin<br />\r\n- Functional windows and sunblind<br />\r\n- Readable script for implementing features to your models<br />\r\n- Wipers<br />\r\n- Cabin displays<br />\r\n- Custom engine and sound",
