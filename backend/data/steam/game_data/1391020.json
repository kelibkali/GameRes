    "description": "Do you love word games but feel they suffer from a lack of nefarious fae? Tomes and Quests has you covered! <br><br>This is a word game at heart with an RPG twist to give you a whole new take on word-building puzzlers. <br><br>Three friends are trapped in a book, forced to battle their way through a fantasy land rife with magic. It’s not all bad though - now they have awesome abilities powered by words! And you just happen to be the lexicon master that can help them save the worlds!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1391020/extras/e0308a84000c9c7f7371d693da741709.avif?t=1714673782\" width=640 height=362 /></span><br>Attack enemies during battles by placing interconnecting letter tiles on the play board to spell words. <br><br>Each letter tile has a point value; more points = more power, triggering your heroes’ special abilities! Upgrade your classes and upgrade your equipment through loot you find to unlock epic strategies.<br><br>As you spell a word you can see the damage you’ll cause in the enemy’s health bar.  Match your hero’s element to your target’s vulnerabilities for critical results!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A Word RPG</h2>After each battle collect your loot and experience to help you on your quest, unlocking new classes and abilities!<br><br>Your heroes start with three base classes and you can unlock new options through quests:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Sage → Alchemist, Summoner, etc.<br></li><li>Rogue  → Archer, Beastmaster, etc.<br></li><li>Brawler  → Berserker, Templar, etc.</li></ul>You’ll need to find them all and master them to discover the full story!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Words for All</h2>Tomes and Quests has a dynamic difficulty system that keeps the game accessible to all.<br><strong>Play in your best language!</strong><br>The story is translated into English and French, and all the word games can be switched to any of these languages at any time!<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> English<br></li><li>  Français<br></li><li>  Deutsche\t<br></li><li>  Italiano<br></li><li>  Nederlands<br></li><li>  Español<br></li><li>  Português</li></ul><br><strong>Lost a fight?  </strong><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Switch your classes and equipment to tweak your strategy and try again immediately at no penalty!<br></li><li>You can always grind earlier battles for XP and loot to level up your class and upgrade your equipment!</li></ul>Mini-game challenge settings adapt to your skills: how you score helps set goal targets later in the game, so the game progresses at your speed.",
