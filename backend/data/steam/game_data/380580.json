    "description": "<strong>Play as an unicorn who crashes its ship on an alien planet where nothing makes sense. In your journey you will face many perils, but will you make it out of this strange planet alive? </strong><br><br><i>Spacecorn </i>was made by three portuguese students (we like to call ourselves <i>Gentlemen in Tuxedos</i>, picture it as company name) on summer break. <br>This is the first chapter, of a series that will be coming soon(at least that's the plan).<br><br>We hope you enjoy our little adventure through the world of programming and video games. That said, we plead that you don't take it seriously from a gameplay perspective, enjoy the ride!",
