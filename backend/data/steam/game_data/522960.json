    "description": "Airship Commander is my attempt to cram together a Wing Commander inspired mission structure, with the multi-station B-17 bomber sim popular in 1990s. Except with airships. Over a steampunk mega city one. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is all about doing what VR does well. Namely move slowly, communicate a tremendous sense of scale, and have all kinds of wild spectacle occurring around the player at different distances.",
