Characters hold an air cannon that allows them to vacuum air in and release it as a blast. It can be used in various ways: pushing an opponent, grabbing, holding and throwing items as projectiles, navigating on slippery surfaces by giving yourself a push, etc...<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1270630/extras/6428b05108e2145e959ebdecce537b88.poster.avif?t=1584490176\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1270630/extras/6428b05108e2145e959ebdecce537b88.webm?t=1584490176\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1270630/extras/6428b05108e2145e959ebdecce537b88.mp4?t=1584490176\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>That mechanic is creatively used in each game mode and helped design games with a fresh feel despite being relatively familiar premises.

However, skills matter. Games are skill-based, varied and deep enough so that while the main mechanic is shared between each modes, the skills and strategy required are wildly different. Team game modes even add some cooperation elements to the mix!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1270630/extras/813b3cfe1e3fd448d5ebaab3e07eecab.poster.avif?t=1584490176\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1270630/extras/813b3cfe1e3fd448d5ebaab3e07eecab.webm?t=1584490176\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1270630/extras/813b3cfe1e3fd448d5ebaab3e07eecab.mp4?t=1584490176\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>The difficulty curve is so that the game is as enjoyable for a family with young children who want a simple fun game and experienced gamer friends hanging out who want a friendly (or high-stakes) competition.<br><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1270630/extras/3ddfa6cf83fa2248123049bc985905e1.webp?t=1584490176\" width=408 height=60 /></span><br>The heart of the game is the tournament mode where players will compete in a succession of games earning tournament ranking points after each of them.
