    "description": "Are You a Boat? is an action 2D platformer with a paper aesthetic that tells the story of Paperman and his dream of becoming a boat, currently in Early Access. The game will be updated periodically. He must overcome people's preconceived notions of him and gain self confidence to achieve his dreams.  The game has 4 action packed boss battles and six platforming levels.  You can transform into a throwing star to attack enemies and later a shield to defend yourself from harm.  Face knights, giant squirrels, robots, and dragons to prove you are worthy of being a boat.<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Platforming<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Boss battles</li><li>Voice Acting</li><li>Rich Story</li></ul></li></ul>",
