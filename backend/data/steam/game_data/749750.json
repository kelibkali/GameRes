    "description": "Downstairs at Grandma´s House is a classic puzzle game following the traits of the legendary arcade games. Make your way through varying and challenging levels and compete with your friends. You will have to collect all cherries in a level to open the chest where the key to the next floor is kept. On your way through the levels you will face a lot of difficult challenges and opponents. Most of the enemies are harmless and could be also very useful, while others want to see you fail.<br />\r\nDownstairs at Grandma´s House is freemium, while the main campaign is free, a DLC is required to unlock the level editor and custom campaigns.",
