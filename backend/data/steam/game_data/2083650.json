Both in looks and mechanics. By taking a minimalist approach in graphics, the focus is shifted to the puzzles. Without any distractions you can fully focus on finding the answers.

Navigate the levels trying not to get yourself stuck.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Boxes!</strong> As in Sokoban, but instead of being the goal they get in your way. But maybe you could find a way to put them to good use?</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Pits!</strong> Our snake friend isn't the best at climbing, crossing these obstacles may prove to be a challenge.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Doors!</strong> Some people really don't like snakes and placed doors to keep them out.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Switches!</strong> Using door handles proved to be too difficult for the snake. Introducing floor switches to open the doors solved this.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Undo / redo system.</strong> It's okay to make mistakes. Having the ability to undo your actions will help you in finding the solution.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2083650/extras/95be2e8cb24fee603e63c6acb311b3b1.poster.avif?t=1765224582\" width=374 height=300 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2083650/extras/95be2e8cb24fee603e63c6acb311b3b1.webm?t=1765224582\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2083650/extras/95be2e8cb24fee603e63c6acb311b3b1.mp4?t=1765224582\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >SobokoSnake was favorably received in /agdg/'s 45th demo day.
