There's no gimmicks, just high-quality level design and crushing old-school difficulty, with some modern quality-of-life touches. If you don't usually play very difficult games, this is a good place to start. Plus: a delightful demoscene/tracker soundtrack from some of the genre's most eminent musicians! It is also a role-playing game, because you play the role of Lawyer Guy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Free, to keep, forever, no strings attached.</h2>This game is a weird passion project and I want to make it available to as many people as possible. Therefore, it is free. Later on, there will be a 'Deluxe Edition' available to purchase with a small amount of bonus content.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Multiple levels. To compare, a game like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas™ only has one level<br></li><li> No shaders: absolutely no shaders. None.<br></li><li> The motion captured performance of Tom Hanks<br></li><li> Probably the only video game about a lawyer ever made.<br></li><li> Portable checkpoints, so you can enjoy a checkpoint at home or on the go.<br></li><li> Canon Gay<br></li><li> The second ever strand type game<br></li><li> A ranking system<br></li><li> Not roguelike<br></li><li> Doesn't cost any money even though I spent years making it.<br></li><li> The Dark Souls®</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Testimonials</h2><i>&quot;This game is too difficult&quot;</i> -my friends<br><i>&quot;How's that Lawyer Man game you're working on?&quot;</i> -my family<br><i>&quot;Lawyer Guy should have a katana made from nippon steel folded over 4000 times&quot;</i> -internet anime reviewer<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Lawyer Guy needs YOU!</h2>If you have opinions about this game, head over to my website (link is -&gt; thataway), where you'll find playtester feedback forms and contact information.
