    "description": "Arguably the most well-known indie game of all time, Cave Story features a completely original storyline wrapped with personality, mystery and hours of fast-paced fun. Cave Story is an action-adventure game from the critically acclaimed independent designer, Daisuke Amaya--or Pixel to his fans. Overflowing with unmatched charm and character, Cave Story takes you into a rare world where a curious race of innocent rabbit-like creatures, called Mimigas, run free.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tYou wake up in a dark cave with no memory of who you are, where you came from or why you're in such a place. Uncovering Mimiga Village you discover that the once-carefree Mimigas are in danger at the hands of a maniacal scientist. The Mimigas’ only hope rest squarely on the shoulders of a quiet, amnesiac boy who can't remember his own name.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tRun, jump, shoot, fly and explore your way through a massive action-adventure reminiscent of classic 8- and 16-bit games. Take control and learn the origins of this world’s power, stop the delusional villain and save the Mimiga!<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features:</h2>\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Original (320x240) graphics and upgraded “HD” graphics<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Remastered music as well as the original soundtrack<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Mix-and-match new/old artwork and music!<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Six new play modes (including Wind Fortress, Boss Rush and more!)<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Over 20 epic boss battles through Mimiga Island<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>15 levels to explore in the vast world<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>10 unique weapons to find and upgrade<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>USB controller compatibility<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Four unique endings<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Future content updates<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li></ul>",
