    "description": "Welcome to My Neighborhood Arcade where we provide a casual gaming experience with a revolving set of free to play arcade/mini games for you to enjoy! Our collection includes arcade classics, puzzle, strategy, shooting, racing games and more. While the selection changes on a rotating schedule, whatever is currently on the arcade floor is available for you to play without in-app purchasing interruptions. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur virtual arcade runs on credits and tickets, both of which you’ll find easily available—it’s like we left buckets of credits and piles of tickets just laying around and everyone is welcome to them. Use credits to play games and earn tickets to redeem for in-game “prizes” across all available games (such as extra lives, unlocking cars in racing games, power-ups, etc.).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy Neighborhood Arcade also lets you build you own game collection—imagine having a private game room in your local arcade. Purchase DLC packs to add games to your permanent collection and these games are then always available for you to play, even when they’re rotated off of the main arcade floor. <br />\r\n <br />\r\nWhat’s an arcade without a soundtrack? My Neighborhood Arcade also includes Infinity Jukebox, a genre-based music player. Infinity Jukebox is stocked with hundreds of high-quality game music tracks, tagged with multiple genres to provide you with custom music scores in games or in the separate jukebox player.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe'd love to hear your experience good or bad, please join us on our Discord channel:<br />\r\nhttps://discord.gg/t6QRcR3",
