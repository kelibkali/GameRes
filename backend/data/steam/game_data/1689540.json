You over there! It isn’t too late to turn back. To just flutter away unscathed, like a dainty butterfly narrowly evading a cobweb. More like a... <strong>macabre</strong> web! Get it? <br><br>But we’re already past that, aren’t we? <br><br>You — a lowly gnomeling — are just too curious for your own good. <br><br>YOU want to know how it feels to race... through MY mind. To blast off... your rocker. To fly like a fairy... with no strings attached. You really think you can comb through MY catacombs and come out on top, don’t you? How <i>cute</i>. Or are you one of those kamikazes? Let’s just say you’ll be a coma-kaze after I’m done with you!<br><br>Because we only sell one-way tickets to the state of Catatonia. No, in the Nation of Imagi, there are no flyover states. You <i>will</i> stop. You <i>will</i> stay a while. Maybe even forever. But don’t you worry your pretty little head! It won’t be intac— errr, it’s going to have so much fun, it’ll be insane! Hysterical, really. <br><br>Feeling disoriented yet? Just wait ‘til you’re whizzing through the Nooks of Crania. Soaring through the Serotunnel. Racing your own intrusive thoughts. Zooming over highways, byways, and freeways. But wait a sec. Are you really on a <i>freeway</i> if you’re <i>captiv</i>… ated? Ha, ha, ha! <br><br>Anyway, if you’re brazen enough to make it this far, you’re a lost cause. Go on, dauntlessly don those wings. The first set’s on me! Customize your look if you want, but what’s the point? There’s no room for vanity in insanity! And everyone knows all gnomelings look alike when they’re turned inside out. Figuratively, of course. Well, maybe... dis-figuratively. Because when you don’t mind your own business, I might get busy bending your mind. And it may not ever bend back. <br><br>Soon, you’ll know <i>exactly</i>... what... I... mean.<br> <br>Enjoy the curs— errr, course!<br><br>Forever yours, <br><i>Malchrim Ick</i>",
