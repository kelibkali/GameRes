    "description": "&quot;I held a beautiful blue flower in my hand. But then it was crushed when I tried to caress it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt shattered like glass, much like the fragile wall of humanity's hearts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI could not side with them, but I could not side against them. I am trapped between the wall between love and hate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy friends betrayed me for what I became. My tale is one woven, spindled in sadness, hatred, disgust, and hatred for the humans that grew to hate me. But I knew in that hatred that I could change them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd that's what being a God means.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n• The final chapter to the Even For Eternia saga.<br />\r\n• 3 additional hours of gameplay.",
