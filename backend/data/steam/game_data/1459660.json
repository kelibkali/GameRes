    "description": "You wake up in the middle of the Colosseum with no memory.  You start your struggle to survive in the Colosseum without knowing who you are and where slaughtering is just entertainment.  In the middle of the Colosseum, all you can rely on is your weapons, shields and skills.  It's up to you whether you're going to be a Gladiator that cuts off the heads of countless enemies, or you're going to be one of the thousands of bodies that can't be recorded anywhere in the history books.<br><br><strong>&quot;Become A Gladiator VR&quot;</strong> is not a perfect physical simulation game containing real-world like interactions. This is a <strong>PVP specialized VR</strong> action game that prioritizes action itself rather than focusing on historical research. It is designed to <strong>allow players to feel and learn when and how to swing swords and shields</strong>, which is temporarily impossible to control or immobilize due to collisions between weapons and shields.<br><br>Due to the characteristics of the game, players may have to move around a lot, so please refer to the precautions below.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>2x2m space is required due to possible injury or real damage to property.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Due to the above reasons, free movement is not supported, so it is recommended gamers use a stick to move the characters in the center of the VR area.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Sufficient stretching is required before playing to prevent injury.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A 10-minute break is recommended after playing the game for between 2 and 30 minutes or more.</li></ul><br>Please provide contructive feedback on playing conditions, inconveniences experienced, and balance issues, etc.",
