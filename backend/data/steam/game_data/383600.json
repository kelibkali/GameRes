The main feature, &quot;Sea of Stars Suite&quot; by Evelyn Sykes, is composed of the fully-orchestrated theme, traveling and combat music. The second track, &quot;Alien Space&quot; by Rich Carlson is a journey through the many musical and ambient soundscapes you hear when encounters, discoveries and other events occur in the game. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Evelyn Sykes is an award-winning composer who has written a huge variety of music for film, concert and dance including feature films such as Tuesday, Resurrecting the Streetwalker and The Hit Producer.
