Morgan and Elliot want to fly planes but they know they can’t because they're just little kids. Maybe they can make paper planes instead! But um… they can’t remember how.  Hopefully someone can teach them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >FEATURES</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>PAPER PILOTS:</strong> The first VR episode of MORGAN LIVES IN A ROCKET HOUSE (running Time: 4 minutes).</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>TELEPORTING:</strong> Jump around the village after the show, or re-watch the cartoon from different positions.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>SIZE MODES:</strong> Watch the cartoon from different perspectives.
