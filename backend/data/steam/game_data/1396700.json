    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >     Pathfinder RPG - Wrath of the Righteous AP 4: The Midnight Isles</h2>Chapter 4: &quot;The Midnight Isles&quot;<br>by Greg A. Vaughan and James Jacobs<br>After an audience with the Crusader Queen, the heroes journey to a fortress that straddles the boundary between this world and the demon-haunted realm of the Abyss. There, they must face powerful agents of the architects of the Worldwound and put a stop to the production of the powerful elixirs being used to grant demons mythic power. Beyond the fortress lies the Abyssal realm of the Midnight Isles, lair of the succubus queen Nocticula--and the source of the crystals used to create the mystical elixirs.
