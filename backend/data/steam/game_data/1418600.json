    "description": "<strong>Welcome to 109 Remaster Demo</strong><br><br>109 Remastered is a ground up remaster of a game Blind Alien Productions released oh so long ago on a different platform. This remaster was completed by the lead developer of the original project in conjunction with friends who met up in the middle of the 2020 Outbreak after they decided to rekindle some old game developer flames in an effort to build something in the middle of precarious circumstances. We hope you enjoy it. We enjoyed making it.<br><br><strong>In 109 Remastered</strong> players will pilot a scout ship that has befallen an unfortunate fate while out on routine patrols. In the midst of the celestial ruins they must search in a bid for survival, they will find something disturbing.<br><br>Since this is the Demo version, player will not have access to any of the story elements save for the first cutscene. As such this is more of a free flight demo and bug fixing run since we're a very small team and not everyone has time to contribute to testing.",
