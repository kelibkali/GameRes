    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Time to Enlist Is Now!</h2>In The Red Stare, you become a special agent in 1950s New York City on a stake out. The Reds have infiltrated the city, and you need to stop them before it's too late. <br>During your stake out you will be observing your neighbours' every move to find out who of them is the communist spy.<br><br>From within your apartment you'll be receiving information via your phone and fax machine, finding clues in case files, and taking pictures that you can fax to your handler - proving that your suspicions are right.<br><br>It's all about observation and deduction. You’ll have to use a number of different ways to identify people varying from appearances, items that can be found in their rooms, and rules only specific members of the communist ranks follow.<br><br>Good luck, agent! The nation depends on you.",
