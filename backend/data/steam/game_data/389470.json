Appearances can be very deceiving, however .... Beneath the peaceful tranquility of this small village, a horrifying truth lingers.<br><br>Whispers in a dusty, secluded library ripple with fear as questions of the past are brought into the present. Is there a link between the return of Halley's comet and the resurgence of the Great Ancients who once dominated the land in a reign of terror? Legend tells tales of an ancient ritual ground, hidden deep in the shadows of the tangled forest, marked by an ornate and mysterious cross. Once, long ago, this site was the stage for wild and terrifying rites that no one dare speak of, lest they suffer the wrath of the Ancients.<br><br>Why are the townspeople of Illsmouth struck by such shattering terror? Why are they drawn to the ancient ritual grounds after so many years? What has released this curse from its deep sleep to play havoc upon the souls of innocent people?<br><br>You'll take on the role of John T. Carter, a brilliant young astronomer, piecing together the puzzling history of the village and its cryptic inhabitants. Incredibly realistic action and supernatural chaos intertwine to draw players deep into the puzzling mysteries within the Shadow of the Comet.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Includes the CD-ROM and floppy versions of Call of Cthulhu: Shadow of the Comet.<br></li><li>Bone chilling sound effects that hurtle you into the depths of chaos!<br></li><li>Confront your deepest fears as you enter once more the realm of Lovecraftian horror!</li></ul>",
