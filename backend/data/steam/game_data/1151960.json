    "description": "Commanders of Valor is a strategy, role playing tabletop game. Set in the last two centuries before the common era, players can take control of a royal family of three factions and lead them to glory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRole playing experience: Each character in your family has their own attributes and motives. Treat them fairly and they will become one of your most capable and trusted commanders. Send them to seek education, pursue their hobbies or become a famous sport’s champion to help them achieve greatness. Every decision that these commanders make dynamically shape their future and the way they think of you and your leadership. But beware of unexpected events that may change the course of their journey.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStrategic battlefield: Take charge of your commanders and their armies to lead them to glory on the battlefield. Utilizing the environment and strategic tactics is just as important as training and bringing the right units onto the battlefield. This turn-base experience will let you fight, loot, take prisoners and scare your enemies off the battlefield. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFactions: Pick side with one of the available factions, each with unique roster, play style and gameplay mechanics.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnique rosters: Between Rome, Parthia and Greek States there are more than 25 units, each with their custom design, play style and historically accurate special abilities! Train them, pay them and send them to hospital after battles for them to recover from their injuries. The more victories you earn the more experienced your units become.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMultiplayer: Competitive multiplayer battles is the most fun way to grow your family and push your commanders’ valor to their limits on the battlefield.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSingle player: Each faction has a single player campaign. Following the foot steps of a famous historic character will let you see the world in their eyes and experience their heroics in the engaging story of their lives.",
