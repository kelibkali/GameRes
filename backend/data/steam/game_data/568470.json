There is a mysterious voice that guides him in a journey that will bring him to fabulous places, meeting challenges that he never thought he could face and that will allow him to find the way back home.<br>Dawnfall’s life has been messed up by a book. He doesn’t know why but somewhere in that book he will find answers to all his questions.<br>Waking the Glares is a great journey, an exploration-based game that will require the player to pay attention to the environment from a visual and acoustic point of view.<br>With this release the player will get the first two chapters of Waking the Glares. The complete adventure is intended to be made of seven different chapters and their release will depend on the first release success.<br>But please note that every single chapter tells a story on its own, just, there’s a thread passing through all the chapters. In game terms, this means that every single chapter is set in a different location with a slightly different gameplay.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/568470/extras/154a80af54b0a307ffd8912396cd019a.avif?t=1602790779\" width=616 height=586 /></span><br><br>The story revolves around a book that has messed up Dawnfall’s life.
