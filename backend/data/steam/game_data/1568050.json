A way to do this is to work in split-screen mode, but we all know that it compromises video size! Here's where Pinned comes in place; with one click, you can make the text editor stays on top, so you'll be able to keep working and enjoy watching the video on full screen. Furthermore, you can pause/play/mute/unmute the video without switching between tabs.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Pinned Can</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Pin any browser on top (Chrome, Edge, Firefox etc)</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Pin any communication app on top (Discord, Zoom, Teams etc)</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Pin any text editor on top (Word, Wordpad etc)</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Pin any ide on top (Visual Studio Code, Intelij etc)</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Pin any tools on top (Paint, Blender, Calculator)</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Pin anything on top!</li></ul>",
