    "description": "AeroChopper is a 2D single-player side-scroller where the player controls a vehicle that can transform between helicopter and airplane modes. The player controls this swapping of vehicle types as well as the direction that the vehicle travels. The player will then use this information to traverse dangerous, procedurally generated levels filled with obstacles. These levels are fast-paced and designed to put the player's reaction time to the test.",
