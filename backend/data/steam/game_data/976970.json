The game’s best features are its physics, game mechanics, level creator and of course – its endless supply of puns. <br><br>Although there are tools you need to use effectively to be successful, the true challenge lies in mastering the player character itself. From the internal playtests that I have violently forced my friends into, there is truly a difference between a new and experienced player, as a player who has mastered the game’s physics will finish levels considerably faster, collect more points and die less frequently.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/976970/extras/32d77ba8a702c65358576d278e75388e.avif?t=1666061594\" width=608 height=252 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What can you expect?</h2>A delicious zesty story campaign and a fun, simple level creator. For the best experience, I would recommend playing through the campaign first as it introduces the game's mechanics, unlocks skins and delivers a hefty amount of dairy-based puns. <br><br>The campaign contains five challenging levels with fully-voiced cheesy characters hiding in their secret rooms. Find them all to form an army and defeat the mouse emperor's general or fail and watch your family get mercilessly forked!<br><br>The Level Creator is a tool capable of creating maniacal levels straight from Grandpappi's nightmares. Try it for yourself, save your creation and share it with other players through Steam Workshop!<br><br>If you decide to support the game, you're awesome! Every purchase, recommendation, bug report and review is greatly appreciated and truly makes a difference.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/976970/extras/fa2e8d1bc6c26c1574210e9db5f8e58d.avif?t=1666061594\" width=608 height=252 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Who made this cheesy mess?</h2>Hi! My name is Anthony and I am the sole creator of this incredibly cheesy game. The game is the result of my long and unhealthy love and obsession with video games and cheese. <br><br>This is the first ever project that I started in Unity way back in 2015. Since then I started many other projects but never got to finish them. Finally, this year, I have decided to come back to this little cheesy platformer and apply what I learned since abandoning it. The game undertook some massive changes and looks and most importantly feels very different – and better - to what it used to be. It is legenDAIRY!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/976970/extras/b80fed4e63a766531a9a3db39d81f297.avif?t=1666061594\" width=608 height=252 /></span>",
