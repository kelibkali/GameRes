    "description": "Chromancy is a shoot 'em up that tests your wits and reflexes at the same time! Face enemies, dodge obstacles, solve puzzles and fight bosses using the ability to change colors between red, green and blue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow To Play:<br />\r\nThe color you switch to determines the color of the bullet you shoot and also the color of enemy projectiles and obstacles you can absorb or pass through respectively. For example, while the player is red, you can shoot red bullets and absorb red enemy projectiles or pass through red obstacles. Likewise, enemies are only affected by bullets that are of different color to them (e.g. red enemies can only be harmed by green or blue bullets).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis super-addictive and very difficult shoot 'em up game will push your gaming skills to the limit. You won't survive. Demo contains the first 10 levels.",
