    "description": "TRY THE FIRST SIX LEVELS OF THE 30 LEVELS IN THE FULL GAME!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA deadly plague ravages your world. Your last hope: a legendary alien facility dug deep into the Feldspar Mountains...a massive Pit, built by the ancient Suul'ka.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf 'The Pit' really exists, there might be something left. Something that will give your doctors a fighting chance at the cure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll you know for sure is that every expedition into those mountains has failed to return...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd nothing sows death like the Suul'ka.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQuamdiu poteris superesse?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSword of the Stars: The Pit is a fun, fast, light-hearted turn-based RPG, where the tradition of Rogue and other old school dungeon-diving games meets the sci-fi Sword of the Stars universe, where the question to ask isn't &quot;Did you make it to the end?&quot; so much as &quot;How far did you make it into The Pit before the monsters got you?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBe brave, press on for the sake of your planet, and when all else fails, go out in a blaze of glory!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- 3 Characters to choose from... Marine, Pilot and Engineer!<br />\r\n- 30 Levels of ancient evil science between you and the cure!<br />\r\n- Improve your character and increase your skills as you try and find a way to survive the depths.<br />\r\n- Dozens and dozens of enemies drawn from the Sword of the Stars universe!<br />\r\n- Over 50 weapons and armors with a variety of special effects including flamethrowers, rocket launchers, plasma cannons and powered Brawler armor!<br />\r\n- Randomized augmentation effects (for your equipment... and for you!) make each game unique.<br />\r\n- Crafting lets you make special items from bits and pieces of your enemies.<br />\r\n- Over 100 items to discover, ranging from the familiar to ancient exotic tech.<br />\r\n- Dozens of room types containing a host of exotic devices to help - or maybe hinder - your progress.<br />\r\n- Discover and decipher hidden messages, crafting recipes, and pieces of Sword of the Stars lore!<br />\r\n- Many fiendish ways to die including poisoning, disease, traps, radiation, starvation and of course... MONSTERS.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/SwordOfTheStarsThePit<br />\r\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/SolForce<br />\r\nForum: http://kerberos-productions.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=54<br />\r\nWeb page: http://sots-thepit.com/",
