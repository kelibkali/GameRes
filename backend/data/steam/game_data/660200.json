    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Transistor Defense</strong> is a strategic tower defense experience set within a corrupted digital realm, where you must defend against the relentless advance of a rogue sentient AI determined to overtake the network.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Deploy a powerful arsenal of defensive structures to protect your core. Choose from a variety of tower types, each with distinct roles with the capability of being enhanced with powerful modules.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Each enemy wave becomes more challenging as the AI evolves, introducing new enemy types and  behaviors. To survive, you'll need to adapt — utilizing a robust shop system that offers meaningful choices and powerful synergies between tower types.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >After every wave, dive into a <strong>roguelike progression system</strong> through the in-run shop. Spend earned resources to acquire randomized upgrades, or additional towers to tilt the odds in your favor. Every run presents different options, ensuring no two sessions play the same — experimentation and adaptability are key to mastering the network.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/660200/extras/2c984c2ac065255e4e95f25e2f3cc682.poster.avif?t=1758230060\" width=1170 height=668 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/660200/extras/2c984c2ac065255e4e95f25e2f3cc682.webm?t=1758230060\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/660200/extras/2c984c2ac065255e4e95f25e2f3cc682.mp4?t=1758230060\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong><u>EARLY ACCESS NOTICE</u></strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Transistor Defense is currently in active development as an Early Access title.
