Thus, there are 300+ levels in the game.<br></li><li>The &quot;Mosaic Easy&quot; difficulty mode is an ordinary 2D mosaic, even a child can solve it. This cannot be said for all other modes. The most difficult one is &quot;3D Hard&quot;, which has a high combinatoriness and a hard shortage of blocks. This poses a serious intellectual challenge (but all levels in the game are guaranteed to be passable).<br></li><li>The game is non-linear! Many levels have many correct solutions (block stacking sequences), and not just one, conceived by the author of the game.</li></ul>",
