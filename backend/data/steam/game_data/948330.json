    "description": "<strong>The Rundown:</strong><br>Werewolf Hunter X is a 2d crafting survival game that is currently in development by SeaCreatureSandwich, and features unique item building, procedural generation, rogue-like resource scarcity, mythical monsters, and much more.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/948330/extras/031f4141a91dbd2366e7a8c3d4335f67.avif?t=1708029741\" width=392 height=149 /></span>   <br>The unique Item Design mechanic allows the player to create custom items in game time from any available resources.<br>This can be handy for getting out of sticky situations. Fall into a pit while exploring a cave? Build a bat guano ladder! Suprise attack while farming? Build a carrot sword!<br>Material properties directly affect the player and the game world around them, so building armor out of lava is not recommended, but possible. There is no limit to what you can create!  <br><br>Werewolf Hunter X features Procedural world generation, random events, and rogue-like resource scarcity/trade-offs<br><br>Day and night cycle mechanics, persistent time, and weather bring the world to life!     <br><br><strong>​Blueprints: </strong><br>The Blueprint Maker is available at any point during the game. Pick ingredients, design your items game world appearance, review the potential item stats, give the item a name and create the Blueprint. It's fun and easy. <br> <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/948330/extras/6c7c3465c0c5a1c2ac2b47fae9450676.avif?t=1708029741\" width=437 height=149 /></span>  <br>A long time ago the planet called Earth was destroyed. The final act of the human race as Earthlings was to build four massive ships that would hold the sum of our kind. The ships were sent out into the far reaches of the universe in hopes that we might find a new home for mankind. <br><br>Roughly twenty two hundred years later one did! The planet was 98% compatible. Off the charts. The planet's original inhabitants seemed to have suffered a species ending event that left the planet more or less intact.<br><br>After a thorough assessment while in orbit we landed and began to colonize. Our disassembled ship became strong walls around the colony, keeping out the wandering, ruthless monsters that were the shadows of the planet's previous tenants. <br><br>A message was sent to the other three ships so that they could make their way to Humanity's new home, as they had all planned so long ago. <br><br>Now, we are left to prepare for their arrival. We must build our small colony into a great empire, fight off the demons of the new world, and conquer the unruly landscape of our new home.",
