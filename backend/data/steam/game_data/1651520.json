    "description": "<i><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Holy Grain is a narrative game with a large amount of text that addresses sensitive topics such as abuse, drug use, or discrimination, among others.</i><br><br><strong>Holy Grain</strong> is the game your parents would not approve. It's a cult of absurdity and dark humor. It's an endless event explorer. A <strong>roguelike</strong> (or more like, roguelite) with a slightly different twist than the usual. It is a quirky blend that tastes like chocolate ice cream on a hot summer afternoon. In this game, you'll step into the shoes of an average kid whose life's sole purpose is to plant carrots and live a peaceful existence. The <strong>counselor</strong>, a senior with an anarchist mindset, will <i>guide</i> you toward a life of adventures and misfortunes. You'll swap carrots for soldiers and serene sunsets for bloody battles. All to topple the tyrant on the throne: <strong>Albert Smallnose</strong>.<br><br>But truth be told, Albert Smallnose is just the <strong>beginning</strong> of a list of increasingly <strong>difficult and epic challenges</strong>. In Holy Grain, you'll encounter 5 meticulously designed<strong> factions</strong> to spice up your adventure. You'll have to learn to rule them and, above all, to take down their supreme leader when the time comes.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1651520/extras/8d56327af57da8d718621ecc7d2392a8.avif?t=1765808305\" width=600 height=105 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Villagers</strong>: Not much to say about these folks with a poor diet. Countryside people with a lot of pent-up rage and little patience for nonsense, ready to whip out the guillotine at any sign of authority.<br></li><li> <strong>Crusaders</strong>: Silk-clad barbarians. Colonial conquerors who settle in any land they deem fit in the name of the king. But beware, it's best not to mess with them, they're pretty buff.<br></li><li> <strong>Outlaws</strong>: Definitely not a bunch of low-quality folks or smelly armpits. This crew consists of war veterans who decided to go solo after realizing the riches they could attain without a king to obey.<br></li><li> <strong>Goblins</strong>: Surprisingly, the world extends beyond lands filled with humans. These friendly green critters inhabit the most barren and horrible lands you can imagine, scavenging any resource they come across. Sure, they might be a bit clumsy and scrawny, but there's strength in numbers, and they'll follow anyone who can utter two sentences without choking.<br></li><li> <strong>Dark Elves</strong>: Evil, mysterious, and dangerous beings... Or so the classic fantasy narrative would have us believe. Maybe they do harbor some secrets, or perhaps they're just elves with dark skin. You'll have to find out for yourself.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1651520/extras/d7441a8505c52a31a7644f87d2780678.avif?t=1765808305\" width=600 height=105 /></span><br>Holy Grain can be divided into the following gameplay phases, composed of the <strong>following mechanics</strong>:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Exploration</strong>: You'll traverse an extensive world divided into regions with specific climates. Each climate is a world unto itself, and every place you choose to visit will have its own challenges. The key is to plan your journey considering your army's resources and the dangers lurking around. You never know what awaits in that house on the horizon.<br></li><li> <strong>Events</strong>: Each time you progress within a region, you'll face a semi-randomly generated event. Many factors will decide its outcome, but it's your decisions that will determine whether you proceed wisely or not.<br></li><li> <strong>Combat</strong>: Eventually, you'll have to resort to force to emerge victorious from some events. After all, you have an army with you for a reason. In these fast-paced and frenetic battles, you'll need to make quick decisions and keep your combat skills sharp to avoid being executed by the enemy commander. Remember, if you die, it's game over.<br></li><li> <strong>Final Boss</strong>: This entire journey will lead you to the continent's supreme leader where you're located. Each continent has a specific structure, meaning some are more complicated than others. However, the ruling faction (and hence, the final boss you'll face) and the faction you lead also matter. What you need to know is that, to advance in the story and complete the last continent, you'll have to defeat each of the final bosses.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1651520/extras/ddc980902bbf1bee2554cade05a0b724.avif?t=1765808305\" width=600 height=105 /></span><br><br><strong>With that being said, buckle up because the advisor is waiting for you. He mentioned something about a revolution; I'd go talk to him to see what he's got to say.</strong>",
