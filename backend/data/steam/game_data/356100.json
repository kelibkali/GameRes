    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > Fuego! </h2>Fuego is an online Mexican standoff game between two opposing players and their teams of gun toting animal-banditos. The game starts in the standoff where players position and orient their banditos one at a time, in double blind turns. During the standoff players are trying to unravel the impending shootout while identifying strategic linchpins and outsmarting their opponent.<br><br>After all the banditos have been placed, the shootout ensues and the players watch the consequences of their actions. You shoot a bank, you get the gold. You shoot a bandito, you steal the gold. Just make sure that when the dust settles, your gang walks away with the bigger haul. Even if that means losing a few friends along the way.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Game Modes</h2><strong>Online Multiplayer</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Play against random opponents or arrange matches with friends<br></li><li>Collect new animal banditos and accumulate gold</li></ul><strong>Single Player / Offline </strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Single Player Puzzle Mode</strong> - Solve 60 Mexican standoff puzzles<br></li><li><strong>AI</strong> - Practice your skills against an AI opponent</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Press / Awards</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><i>&quot;Indie Game Showcase&quot; - Boston Festival of Indie Games, 9 September, 2015 </i><br></li><li><i>&quot;Indie Prize Showcase&quot; - Casual Connect, 11 August, 2015 </i><br></li><li><i>&quot;PAXEast2015 Indie MEGABOOTH Showcase&quot; - Indiecade, 6 March, 2015 </i><br></li><li><i>&quot;Best of IXC Game Tasting&quot; - Indiecade, 9 October, 2014 </i><br></li><li><i>&quot;Quick and elegant fun.&quot; - Alice O'Connor, Rock Paper Shotgun </i><br></li><li><i>&quot;Just a super addicting game.
