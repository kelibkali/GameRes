    "description": "This is the Doors Quest Demo soundtrack, consisting of all 4 original pieces of music from the game Doors Quest Demo. Like the game Doors Quest Demo, it is short but bad.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTracklist:<br />\r\n01_Game_Start.mp3 (01:04)<br />\r\n02_Game_Credits.mp3 (01:03)<br />\r\n03_Hidden_Room.mp3 (01:04)<br />\r\n04_Endgame.mp3 (00:53)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs an added bonus, have a copy of the album The Static, also made by Nick Page!, even though none of those songs are in Doors Quest Demo. The suggested pricing for this DLC when my native currency, the US Dollar, was entered, means that if you are purchasing this from Europe, you are paying more than people who live in my country, given current and historic exchange rates. But, if you are buying this for 15,000 Vietnamese Dong, you are getting a heck of a bargain.",
