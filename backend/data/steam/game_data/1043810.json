They're more about deciding how you want this character to treat people, and how much you want to dig into or push back at what the other person is saying.<br></li><li>It's not a roguelike. Every now and then someone will call it that and we don't know why! Every level is handcrafted.<br></li><li>It's not XCOM. This is a much shorter, story-driven experience about a cast of unique characters. There's no base-building or equivalent.<br></li><li>It's not Into the Breach. This is more forgiving, but the ceiling on how many different things you can do in a turn is higher.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What is it?</h2>Come on, we just went over this with gifs and everything.",
