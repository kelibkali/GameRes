    "description": "NKCell - Natural killer cell - is a cell that can react against and destroy another cell without prior sensitization to it.<br />\r\nThey are part of our first line of defense against cancer cells and virus-infected cells.<br />\r\nAn NK cell attaches to a target cell, releases chemicals that breach its cell wall, and causes it to lyse (break up).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou are one of a genetically modified NKCell that can destroy viruses and bacteria.<br />\r\nIn the game, you will be standing in a blood vein and slash incoming diseases/infected cells to keep the infection rate low, and help the host to survive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is simple. If you see an infection, slash it!<br />\r\nCurrently, there are 36 levels with 15 different types of diseases.<br />\r\nThere are only a couple of musics in the game, but you can always disable the music and play anything you want.",
