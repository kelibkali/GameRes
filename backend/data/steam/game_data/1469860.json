Even for a simple and small game, a lot of work was put into it, and it still makes me proud. What you'll get here is a simple runner, only one button needed, quite good to form theories and speculations about its setting and to glimpse at my mental state at the time. Hope you enjoy =)<br><br>***************************************<br><br>You are lost in a place between the living and the dead. A stranger informs you about your lack of destiny, guiding you to a way out. Collect your memories so you can escape this dark realm.<br><br>- Use the keyboard keys (<i>Z</i>, <i>Space</i>, <i>Up</i>) to jump over the platforms and collect memory fragments;<br>- Use the <i>mouse</i> or <i>arrow keys</i> to navigate the game menu, confirming with a click or pressing <i>Z</i>;<br>- Press <i>Esc</i> to return to te previous menu or to exit the game;<br>- Collect enough souls to create memory glimpses and discover your forgotten past;<br>- Don't give up.
