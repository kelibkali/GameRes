    "description": "※English translations  and BGM have been added!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a demo version of a completely original, full-color visual novel.<br />\r\nMore than 400 stills for the demo version (more than 700 for the full version).<br />\r\n※This work contains very extreme and grotesque language. There is no sexual content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTotal play time is expected to be 5 hours (the production version is about 8 hours).<br />\r\nThe background music is a sophisticated piece of music written by several excellent Japanese composers.<br />\r\nFrom the first time you play, the game has a &quot;Start from any chapter&quot; mode.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the trial version, you can play the scenario from the prologue to chapter 10.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory.<br />\r\n　2020, Japan. Boring everyday. Uninspired days. The world is still as rotten as ever.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n　I wish that everything would break down anyway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n　Even if I thought about that, I guess life would go on unchanged.",
