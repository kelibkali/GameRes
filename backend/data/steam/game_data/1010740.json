    "description": "Scrapyard Robot Rampage is a simple game. You shoot something, and it will die. But there's a catch. Everything might die quick, but you do too. Fight through the endless night as a pair of floating hands with a simple slam shotgun as your world slowly descends in to static madness.<br><br>The game is a simple run and gun, fighting for space as more and more enemies slowly pile on. The amount of time you survive depends on if you can make the shot.<br><br><br><i>Quick note: Please read the Early Access section of our page. It explains more about why we're going in to Early Access so early in the game's life, as well as addresses our plans for the future.</i>",
