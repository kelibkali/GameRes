Your job is to fix them in time.<br><br>Each level features a different set of glitches that will affect the gameplay: low gravity, water physics, larger enemies, bigger explosions... and many more (there are currently over 40 glitches implemented in the game).<br><br>In order to help you fix all these glitches, you can unlock special powers, such as a rocket launcher, a teleporter, a gravity inverter, a shotgun, as path finder... as well as a perk, which will make your job easier, for instance by reducing damage, dropping more items, giving you more health...<br>Picking the right powers for the right glitches can make all the difference!<br><br>Each level is procedurally generated and can be restarted if you fail, but will consume time. Its general layout will remain the same so you can learn from your mistakes.<br><br>A very early version of the game made first in the mobile category of js13k 2016, and second overall.<br>However, the game has changed a lot since then and the js13k entry is not representative of the final product.<br><br>The game features both keyboard and controller support.",
