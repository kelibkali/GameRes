This isn't relevant to the game page but, I would just like to say that this is a very special game that comes from a place of true passion, respect and a love for the art form that is video games. After releasing my first game on here in 2016, I decided to take a step back for a bit to learn more and really improve upon my skill sets to become the best game developer that I could be. Games should have a certain level of polish and quality to them and I now understand the importance of that. Because just like grandma's cookies, games should be made with love and care. Nobody wants to eat sloppily made, poorly put together rushed out cookies. My experience developing this game over the course of nearly 2 years has taught me a lot and I feel that I have greatly matured as a video game developer and artist. To me, Giraffe Town is much more than another one of my silly ideas. It is a personal love letter expressing how I feel about indie games and what indie games are to me. And that is crazy, over-the-top, extremly ridiculous and very ambitious ideas that would never be accepted or created by most mainstream triple-A developers. This is where indie devs come in. Thanks for stopping by and here's to independent artist everywhere! I look forward to bringing more of my ideas to life in the future. Enjoy!<br><br><br>-Samer Khatib (Snowconesolid)<br>(Greatest independent game developer of all time and space)<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/941480/extras/bbe742cf0fe9780372887c5cb927aa4b.avif?t=1765333386\" width=616 height=200 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/941480/extras/3cee0129445b35a2d5a6c7ac8cf6f7b8.avif?t=1765333386\" width=478 height=268 /></span>",
