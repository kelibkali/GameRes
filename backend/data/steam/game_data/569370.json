    "description": "Bitdude is the classic story of our favorite little dot-chomper but from another perspective. Sure, eating dots and fruit to get more points seemed harmless, but did you ever stop to think about their lives?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Bitdude, players play as the &quot;bit&quot;, trying to survive Chompman's unrelenting hunger. Try to obtain the best score in each level by escorting your fellow bits to safety and nom'ing on the fruit before Chompman can.",
