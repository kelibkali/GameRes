    "description": "<i>Up in the Air</i> is a zany, open-world game in which you play a balloon dog exploring a demented carnival populated by crazy children. Players must use a variety of power-ups, from water balloons to ground pound, to fend the kids off and collect carnival tickets. Players can burn Big Weenie, knock over a castle, trap children in a cardboard jail, master hopscotch, become radioactive, turn off the sun, or get popped by a cactus. If they are particularly unlucky, they could even find the notorious child Chunkles and his gaping maw.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Open world sandbox-style gameplay set in an amusement park<br></li><li> An achiever's dream with dozens of challenging mini-games<br></li><li> Fun hidden puzzles and prizes throughout the park<br></li><li> Casual, silly gameplay and mild, subversive humor that will appeal to kids and adults</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Notes:</h2> <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <i>Up in the Air</i> is published by SMU Guildhall and developed a small student team at SMU Guildhall over a development cycle of 16 weeks.<br></li><li> Proceeds from your purchase of <i>Up in the Air</i> on Steam supports the students.

The game was made by students at SMU Guildhall who are graduating in May, 2020 during the height of the Covid-19 outbreak. This is a difficult time for everyone.  We decided to make <i>Up in the Air</i> and our other recent releases free for two reasons:  1) With a challenging job market, we wanted to show off the students' hard work to as wide an audience as possible.  2) Everyone stuck at home could use some fun, free entertainment.<br><br>If you are one of the gamers who supported our students and purchased the game, <strong>we thank you</strong>.  Proceeds go directly to the students to help offset some of the extra development costs of making and publishing the game.",
