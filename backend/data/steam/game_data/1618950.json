    "description": "One day Frauki was plumbing the depths of Frogland when she spied a lounging Gnome smoking a pipe. Before she could say hello, an evil Alien Robot came and scared the Gnome away! Frauki stepped in and bashed the obnoxious contraption toot sweet. As the devious device fizzled it's last pop, Frauki called out to the Gnome. However, it couldn't hear her over the sound of its own fearful wailing. Stymied, Frauki looked down and saw that the little Gnome had left all his picnicking gear, including a nice cassette deck! She plopped down on the gingham, put on the headphones, and this is what she heard...<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Frauki's Adventure! OST&quot; includes seventeen original chiptune tracks from the Casey Clyde game &quot;Frauki's Adventure.&quot; Also included are the original tracker files in XM format. These can be opened and edited with MilkyTracker.",
