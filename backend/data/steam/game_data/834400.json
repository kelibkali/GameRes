    "description": "The DB BR 643 from RSSLO captures the finesse of the “Talent” in Pro Range fashion, and is perfectly suited for authentic local DB Regio operations!<br><br>Designed with the intention of providing for nearly any passenger operation within Europe, be it for regional stopping, rural trundling or city street-weaving services, the “Talent” family was able to offer up a configuration to achieve.<br><br>The Talent was available in a variety of diesel power types and also electric for work under the wires. The units were also susceptible to internal changes, various passenger luxuries such as a choice of floor height, number of coaches and a multi-purpose area were all options for operators.<br><br>One of the first operators in line for Talent units was Deutsche Bahn, who ordered a diesel-based fleet for use on local, regional services on routes without electrification.<br><br>DB’s new fleet was classified as the BR 643, and was built in 3-car formation to provide suitable capacity on quieter lines. To keep the journey comfortable, the coaches share Jacobs bogies which keeps vibrations to a minimum and also improve the unit’s safety.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Night Train to Lindau<br></li><li>Test Drive – DB 643<br></li><li>Train to Immenstadt</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
