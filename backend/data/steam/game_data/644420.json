    "description": "Xion revives the arcade and shoot ’em ups of the 1990’s in a refreshing and unique way with a fully destructible voxel landscape setting and your very own spaceship that you design and upgrade in an infinite number of ways.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Blast your way and explore through multiple randomized levels, such as Cityscape, Red Valley, Island and Volcanoes, Outer Space and much more. <br />\r\n* Everything is destructible. <br />\r\n* Design and build your own ship.<br />\r\n* Defeat the big bad end-bosses of each level. Proving a challenge for even the most seasoned player.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“I think the golden age of gaming just got here :)”<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“You nailed it when you overhauled the game a couple of releases ago. It's a joy to play, congrats on the full release.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“To be honest this game took me by surprise, I just could not stop playing it.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“The graphic style I must admit I love and the attention to detail is just amazing, one of the things I like the most apart from the game itself is building your own spacecraft it's really, really fun. This game is a must have.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“A big thumbs up. Another one of those VR titles that reinvigorates the genre.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“This game takes me back to Gummi Ship building in Kingdom Hearts 1. Mostly the same principle. Spend points to buy ship structure, engine, power generators and weapons. “<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“The potential here is huge, you play this game and literally dream of where this concept can go.“<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Simple, fun and exhilarating gameplay, build the best ship your credits can buy to beat the game at the hardest level!”<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“What a Great game, i really love the the building system in this game that you can build your own ship and shot your way through levels of levels. Its really enjoyable to just destroy everything on the map “",
