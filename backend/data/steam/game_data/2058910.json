You automatically attack enemies when you get close to them.  Protect the girl from left to right to complete the mission.  It's a cycle, and he repeats the task.  When the girl is approached by the enemy, the timer starts.  The game restarts when the danger lasts too long.  And after the time limit.  The number in the upper right corner is the time.  It will also restart after the time is 0.  Start protecting the girls.",
