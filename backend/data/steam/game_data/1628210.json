You'll dive into a story in which nothing is as it seems. Find out the reasons behind what happened to your family back then. Your decisions will guide the course of the story.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >THE INCIDENT</h2>It's been a while since it happened. Over time, the incident has calmed down. How could this have happened? You have no memory at all, and step by step you are trying to figure out what happened.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >YOUR DECISIONS</h2>Are you someone who runs away from problems or faces them? It is your own decision. Until today you have not received any answers. Now you are going to search for them yourself. Whether you succeed or not depends entirely on you ...<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1628210/extras/4e445a6a686abf7f2bc185e1c4fd563c.avif?t=1622571739\" width=616 height=175 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >LYING SOULS</h2>In Lying Souls™ you'll be immersed in a story in which you'll have to solve, in first person, the mysterious circumstances of a long-past incident in your family. You'll have to dive into different parts of the story and sort everything out. The gameplay is linear, but the story is not. - Not always.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >MAIN FEATURES</h2><strong><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Interactive Story / Own Decisions:</li></ul></strong> You will obviously have to make a decision at some moments that will change the later course of the story for you. Smaller, not so obvious decisions &amp; actions are also part of this. Whether you will find out everything with your decisions is questionable.<br><br><strong><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Notes / Recordings:</li></ul></strong> You will come across a number of audio recordings and various writings and notes. They will help you put the story together. Not everything may always be clearly told / revealed and you will have to find your own explanation.<br><br><strong><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Random Events:</li></ul></strong> You will experience random events from time to time. These are not random &quot;paranormal&quot; events to create a mood, but are always part of the current story and gameplay when they happen.<br><br><strong><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Other special features:</li></ul></strong> Soon!",
