    "description": "This is a small childhood game. You can move blocks up, down, left, and right. The rules of the game are different shapes of blocks composed of small blocks falling from the top of the screen one after another. one or several. These complete bars will disappear immediately to make room for the newly fallen tiles, and at the same time, the player is rewarded with points. The blocks that have not been eliminated keep accumulating. Once they reach the top of the screen, the player loses and the game ends.",
