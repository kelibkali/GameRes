    "description": "one's Colorprints #4: Bridge Gatehouse<br><strong>Map Module for Fantasy Grounds II</strong><br>The Bridge gatehouse stands much like a small stronghold to one end of a big stone<br>bridge. This massive building extends for two levels in height and for one level<br>underground. The bridge gatehouse mantains a well-armed garrison of soldiers as<br>well as a duty office, which oversees the goods moving from one place to another.<br>The bridge gatehouse may stand at the end of a river bridge or before one bridge<br>leading in a great city or even before a big castle. On the ground floor a double<br>gate, sealed by two sturdy iron portcullises, allows or denies the passage through<br>the bridge gatehouse. The gate is flanked by a guardpost and by a duty office. Each<br>caravan or cart crossing the bridge gatehouse must stop and visit this office before<br>going ahead. Two big storage rooms on this level are useful to store seized goods.<br>Large corridors, featuring arrowslits, run along the perimeter of the bridge gatehouse,<br>allowing many soldiers to easily defend the stronghold from every side. Two spiral<br>staircases run all height long through the gatehouse...<br>This product is an installable module for use with the Fantasy Ground II virtual<br>tabletop.
