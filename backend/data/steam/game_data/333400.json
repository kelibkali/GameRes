    "description": "France campaign covers the period of the combat actions from 1914 to 1918. It is focused on the wide scale battles with all kind of the troops involved:infantry,armored vehicles,artillery,air forces. Here the player can see how the nature of that war was changing step by step: the full length offensive in full uniform becomes the thing of the past replaced by bloody and cruel battles in the tranches.This effect was enhanced by the gradual change of the colorful environment to gloomy one.",
