But now, something is wrong.<br><br>A bright Summer's day ends in a snowy Winter's eve. The next morning brings a burst of colorful Autumn leaves and even that is followed by a surprising deluge of Springtime rains. Something (or someone) is tampering with the precious Seasons, making a complete mess of the Realm.<br><br>The Druids of the Esoteric Orders have long fostered this fertile landscape and tended to this delicate mystical balance. And it is up to Warren, a young druid fresh from his Esoteric Training, to discover what is causing this disastrous mixing of Seasons.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/333970/extras/e7425de4f0d004744100aef0cf8462ba.avif?t=1572286462\" width=617 height=112 /></span><br>With a game board that changes based on players’ actions, and units that each have powerful animal abilities, you’ll need to stay focused and never let your guard down.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/333970/extras/d3d93ad7bad1674522f20661f3eae5bc.avif?t=1572286462\" width=616 height=112 /></span><br>Whether it’s the single player story told across more than 130 levels, local or online multiplayer for up to 4 players, there’s enough variety for new and experienced players.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/333970/extras/9bb6ce39c5967c5aef4e650b0040455a.avif?t=1572286462\" width=617 height=112 /></span><br>The professionally composed soundtrack and recorded music brings the Six Seasons beautifully to life.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/333970/extras/fd4d053fe0c38cced30b95b2755213d3.avif?t=1572286462\" width=617 height=112 /></span><br>Nothing is random in A Druid's Duel.
