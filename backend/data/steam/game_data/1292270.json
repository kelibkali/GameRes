You must take out every person you can as you make your way towards the head of the invading company. Fight through the levels of this capitalist hell shown by the theme of each ship. From scientists who took breeding too far to mercenaries who kill their own just to move up, you will have to take everything down.<br><br>Humans are too tough to take head on. You will need to sneak around them and take them out one at a time. Stay out of their sight by tracking their scent and climbing the walls and ceilings. Crawling around will let you slip into tight spaces and use the architecture of the ship to your advantage, but you cannot attack while prowling this way.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1292270/extras/Sneak.PNG?t=1600130915\" /></span><br><br>Pick up and hide the bodies.
