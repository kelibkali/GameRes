    "description": "<strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Ikki Unite: The Glorious Return of the Underdog!</h2></strong><br>Yes, you read that right. No need to clean your glasses or pinch yourself—you’re wide awake! Ikki Unite is making a grand return in 2024! Face off against a locust plague threatening your very existence. Enlist up to 16 friends in this erratic multiplayer bullet hell, sprinkled with Roguelite mechanics. This isn’t just a game; it’s a rebellion bringing back the charm, the chaos, and the &quot;What am I even playing?&quot; vibe of the original 1985 classic.<br><br>🎮 Grab your bamboo 🎮 : <i>Ikki Unite</i>. Because every game deserves a redemption arc, even this one. Get ready for a journey filled with laughter, wrinkled eyes and the kind of fun that only comes when you don't take yourself too seriously. Welcome back, Ikki, we've absolutely not missed you.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2061150/extras/d8ec2e4c33cb1f6e411e422626af2899.poster.avif?t=1715866381\" width=620 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2061150/extras/d8ec2e4c33cb1f6e411e422626af2899.webm?t=1715866381\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2061150/extras/d8ec2e4c33cb1f6e411e422626af2899.mp4?t=1715866381\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><br><strong>Gameplay That’s Foolproof (We Promise):</strong><br><br>Your Noble Quest: Clear the waves of minions, defeat the Boss of each area to finally face and fight the Evil Magistrate. Join forces with your friends on a challenging adventure.<br>Controls: If you could handle a NES controller, you’re overqualified. Arrow keys move, everything else happens like magic (the old-fashioned kind).<br><br><strong>Key Features:</strong><br><br>16-Player Mayhem:<i> Ikki Unite</i> can be played by up to 16 players simultaneously in online cooperation. Create your squad joining Gonbe, the forty-something vigilante, Magoichi, the trigger-happy legend and many others!<br><br>4 Classes: Play as one of the four archetypes: Explorers, Attackers, Enhancers and Healers! <br><br>Epic Action: So much action, you’ll forget you’re playing what was once dubbed the worst NES game ever.<br><br>Roguelite Madness: A different adventure every time you play, chose between a wide set of randomized items and bonuses! Because predictability is so 1985.
