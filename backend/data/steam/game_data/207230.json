One more thing to remember.  Always watch your surroundings when you play in a map as you may get hit by a train, or lose a step and fall off the bridge.  More game modes will be added in the future so please stay tuned.<br><br><u><strong>Capture the Base</strong></u><br>Work as a team and defeat the opposing side by capturing the bases scattered around in the map.  Protect your bases or teammates when they’re capturing.  Be on the lookout as you are capturing, there may be someone to interrupt you right at the end.<br><br><u><strong>Team Last Man Standing</strong></u><br>The team with the most round wins will prevail.  Be careful as there are no respawns during rounds.  There’s nothing like being the last survivor and deliver a win for your teammates at the end while they’re all watching you.<br><br><u><strong>Free for All</strong></u><br>No more friendship, just killing.  Are you the type that prefers being a lone wolf?  This is just for you. The rule is simple.  The one who gets the most kills wins the match.  Careful though as there are wolves lurking in the shadow ready to steal your kill.<br><br><u><strong>Team Deathmatch</strong></u><br>A team with more kills wins the match. To get a kill is the biggest contribution you can make to your team here.  Be a support or that guy who’s always at the very front of battle.  Whatever gets kills is good for the team.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/207230/extras/2bc78c428184471e55916f679caad810.avif?t=1447355405\" width=616 height=268 /></span>",
