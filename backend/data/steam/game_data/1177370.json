    "description": "ArachnoSplat is a arcadey VR game where you take jobs exterminating spiders. Kill the spiders anyway you can. Crush them in your hand, hit them with other objects, spray them with poison, shoot them with high powered &quot;tools&quot; or use an improvised flame thrower.  Be careful because the damage caused to your client's property will count against what the job pays.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game does not have built in jump scares. However, the spiders can crawl up your body or web down on you so make sure you are in a safe space to play.",
