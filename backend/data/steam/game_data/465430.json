    "description": "Welcome to Planck Interdimensional Energy Solutions. Some of the most highly used power sources in the solar system are its Quantum Reactors. These massive constructions, of which there are 8 worldwide, generate energy using a small black hole. They extend miles downward into the earth, and take decades to build.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n•<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVertigo is a first person story-based shooter for the HTC Vive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplore the sprawling underground facilities of Planck International's Quantum Reactor, filled with dark secrets, adorable drones, and parallel universes. You find yourself in the bowels of this machine after being whisked away from your home, and, armed with only the tools you can find, you must make your way to the surface, and the truth. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n•<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis machine lies mysteriously abandoned, but there may be something lurking in the darkness. Why else would those adorable security drones shoot on sight, and the turrets do their best to blast you into a small crater? <br />\r\n<br />\r\n <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFace the challenge of escaping the depths of the quantum reactor.",
