    "description": "Start at the dawn of the day, in a closed room. Build Bot from scratch, your only companion for the entire game.<br />\r\nAchieve tasks and games, resolve enigmas like in an escape room and reach the goal to move on to another day.<br />\r\nEach day has a different objective and achievements to realize, until the end of this first episode. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe experience will be different for each player, as Bot’s mood changes and adapts depending on how you interact. A lot can happen, and each experience is unique!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe are an independent studio, we need you and your feedback to help us resolve some possible bugs.<br />\r\nWe hope you're going to have fun and enjoy playing Dwingle. Now let's work on the next episodes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you!",
