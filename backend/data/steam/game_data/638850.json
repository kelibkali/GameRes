    "description": "Animallica is an adventure game set in a post-apocalyptic world where Earth hangs in the balance, after a wicked, deadly virus was unleashed upon all of its creatures.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Story:</h2>As the lone survivor in the last conservation center on Earth you must navigate the many available biomes to fulfill your mission of creating a facility responsible for gathering and maintaining the remaining animals on Earth. You have very little to start with but your wits and some meager scavenged supplies.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/638850/extras/283500ba03ae56d8c91977927acc6740.avif?t=1661759072\" width=610 height=148 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Craft &amp; Survive:</h2>The world is in chaos, bands of scavenging human raiders and mutated creatures are everywhere. You begin to craft survival gear and weapons along with finding shelter, food and water. <br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/638850/extras/107345d5819b29b16ec20438c164154a.avif?t=1661759072\" width=610 height=148 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Explore the World:</h2>As you travel using an abandoned hot air balloon and explore on foot or on horseback, you find a world of varied landscapes and opportunities and countless dangers.  From the grasses of an African Savannah to tall Alpine mountains, Egyptian deserts, and Asian-themed gardens, the world is still full of beauty, but danger is everywhere.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/638850/extras/cae559e7b5843dc86c85d2a7ef87cf4c.avif?t=1661759072\" width=610 height=148 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Save the Animals:</h2>Animals in need are all diseased and must be tranquilized, cured, and tamed if they have a chance of survival. Do you cure and release them, keep them in a more zoo-like setting or in a large park-like sanctuary?  The choice is yours, but they need your help!<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/638850/extras/9f2526b41872499ea4911862d58786d6.avif?t=1661759072\" width=610 height=148 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Build your Settlement:</h2>Will you build a large settlement with all available crafting stations and large, well-furnished houses? There is a flat biome perfect for you. Maybe you would rather be nomadic and use the few crafting stations available through the different biomes while focusing on the animals. You can do that. There is no linear progression and the amount of time you spend gathering, crafting or collecting animals is up to you. You will need to do all of these to succeed, but how and when is your choice.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/638850/extras/3828a2352c95341ed19692ccdc8d1c40.avif?t=1661759072\" width=610 height=148 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Trade:</h2>Vendors and traders are scarce but provide valuable items including rare animals for those with coin. Items that they offer for sale can usually be collected and crafted, but do you have the time? Maybe you are missing that one ingredient for a must-have item. They probably have it, for a price.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/638850/extras/f547f59275c9ddd38ff7b10efed88256.avif?t=1661759072\" width=610 height=148 /></span>",
