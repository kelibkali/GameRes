    "description": "Outrage is a short cyberpunk dungeon crawler. You manage a team of vigilantes and must undertake various missions in the city to strengthen your team and your cause in order to bring a powerful enemy to justice. However, you will not be able to undertake every single mission and therefore have to choose them wisely. <br><br>Some missions will bring you valuable new gear or a new teammate, whilst others will give you useful intel or advantage in an upcoming main story mission. In addition, most missions will affect your reputation, either positively or negatively. <br><br>Will you hunt down petty criminals and help the police or will you do questionable acts to further your own goals? Either path can lead you to victory, but beware – your overall reputation will affect what happens in the end. <br><br><br><strong>General Features:</strong><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><br></li><li>Build a team of vigilantes and undertake missions in the city to deal your own brand of justice! <br></li><li>Choose your missions wisely, for you have a limited number of days between the main story tasks. <br></li><li>6 different vigilantes to choose from. Pick any 2 to start with and recruit the others as you progress through the story. <br></li><li>Reputation system: Most missions either increase or decrease your reputation. With positive reputation, police will tolerate you, whilst underground movements will despise you. Negative reputation does the exact opposite! <br></li><li>3 different endings, depending on your overall reputation in the endgame. <br></li><li>Customize your team with a large variety of weapons, armour, and add-ons <br></li><li>Semi-random rewards: Loot found in supply boxes and given upon quest completion will not be the same on every playthrough. <br></li><li>3 difficulty modes: Casual, Normal, and Tough.</li></ul><br>If you want to support this game and all my other past and future games further, please check out my patreon page below!<br>",
