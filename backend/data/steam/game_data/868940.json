    "description": "<strong>Hi, we’re Digital Myths . . . and welcome to our Study.</strong><br>The Curious Study of Dr. Blackwood is a short, sweet, and simple VR tech demo that shows off our VR skills, as well as gives a sneak peek at our work on our first title, a supernatural adventure game called Project Spectral.  Relax in the beautiful virtual space, mess around with weird objects and magical abilities, or dig a little deeper to uncover some insider secrets we’ve left for you to find.<br><br><strong>So this is a game demo?</strong><br>Not exactly!  This isn’t a traditional demo in the sense of showing off story or full gameplay – we’re not quite that far along yet! But we have created some pretty awesome stuff that we’re proud of – art, environment, effects, magic system, interactions, and virtual presence – and we wanted to share it as soon as we could.  We hope you enjoy this little taste . . . and come back for the more adventurous entrée later! <br><br><strong>So if it’s not a game demo, what do I do?</strong><br>Whatever you like!  We created this virtual space for users to experiment with in VR.  Pick up items, interact with objects, maybe even try casting a few spells.  Keep an eye out for mysterious secrets, or Easter eggs that reveal more about our team and our development.  Or just draw a comfy chair up by the fire and relax . . . and try not to worry about that glowering gargoyle in the corner. . .",
