    "description": "Welcome to Z Ops: Campus<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStep into the shoes of Ema as the zombie apocalypse hits France on its very first day. You and your friend tried to escape, but the campus has become a trap. Now stuck, you've been advised to establish a colony to help other survivors hold out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSurvivors will seek to join your colony. You'll need to manage their morale, meet their needs, and maintain strong relationships to keep them in the group. In return, they’ll contribute to the colony’s tasks and bring valuable skills crucial for survival.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRepurpose classrooms to suit your needs: transform them into resource production areas, sleeping quarters, kitchens, or even trading posts. Trade with other survivors to acquire essential items you can't find on campus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you progress, you'll improve your skills, enabling you to craft better items and unlock new ones. You’ll also become more effective in combat, whether in close quarters or with firearms. But be careful—while most zombies are slow, some are fast, and they can only be killed with headshots!",
