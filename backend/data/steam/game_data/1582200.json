Each hero in your party possesses up to six unique skills that can be utilized to vanquish any monster teeming in each biome. Row management and positioning party members is crucial to combat, especially since four party members can be active at a time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Maintain Character Relationships with the Argument System </h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1582200/extras/9050eb82d350355bd65c01407c8d5530.poster.avif?t=1678283868\" width=624 height=250 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1582200/extras/9050eb82d350355bd65c01407c8d5530.webm?t=1678283868\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1582200/extras/9050eb82d350355bd65c01407c8d5530.mp4?t=1678283868\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Throughout every combat encounter, each hero has an argument meter that rises. Monitoring the meter is crucial during combat since if it gets too high, some heroes might refuse to fight (gotta help your teammates take a chill pill sometimes). Maintaining good relationships will reward you in combat, but bad relationships can lead to negative effects. As each party member fights alongside each other, relationships will also begin to form. Will everyone put their differences aside or will their conflicts lead to doom?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Travel Through Four Unique Biomes</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1582200/extras/9e5d40937bd382d353ff0ac1866122a3.poster.avif?t=1678283868\" width=624 height=250 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1582200/extras/9e5d40937bd382d353ff0ac1866122a3.webm?t=1678283868\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1582200/extras/9e5d40937bd382d353ff0ac1866122a3.mp4?t=1678283868\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Presented in gorgeous pixel art, explore varied biomes that each have their own unique enemies and hidden secrets.
