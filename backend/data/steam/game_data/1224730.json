Every hour you receive a scratchcard and if you get 3 rocket symbols, you win your future. If after 24 hours, you don't have 3 rocket symbols, your fate is already sealed...<br><br>Will you scratch away yourself a future or are you on a collision course for death?<br><br>In this 3D, luck based story game with full voice acting and addicting gameplay, you might just find yourself on the rocket out of this place.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay</h2>The game starts off in an apartment. You hear on your TV that Planet Earth is coming to an end and ZEANOCORP is giving away 25 seats in their spacecraft, if you can match 3 symbols on a scratchcard. Every ingame hour, a new scratchcard comes through your door. You scratch it and move on. If you lose, simply wait for the next one. However If you win, congratulations! You're safe... for now. Then you must make your way through your local town, which is becoming a dangerous place as the end of Planet Earth looms. Hostilities, as well as tensions, are high. The townspeople aren't going to take to you having a winning ticket very well.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A message ZEANOCORP / plot</h2>We have limited seats on our spacecraft, SHIP1. We've decided to give a few away with a random draw across the ZEANOCORP approved countries. You have 24 hours. Good luck.",
