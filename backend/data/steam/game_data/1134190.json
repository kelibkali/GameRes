    "description": "tri.About(&quot;<br><br>tri.Attack(); is a 2D arcade game with a theme inspired by classic Atari-era entertainment. As the player, you control a single tri with unique powers compared to other polygons. The tri has the ability to shoot out of your body. Once shot out, the tri can recall back to yourself. This boomerang-like tri serves as your weapon, which you need to use to defeat enemy polygons.<br><br>Several different enemies exist in the game, each giving different amounts of points. The score gained increases for each enemy defeated with a single shot of your tri. Attempt to get as high of a score as possible, unlocking all of the tri variants as you play!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Tri Types</h2><br><strong>Normal</strong>:<br><br>Your first tri!
