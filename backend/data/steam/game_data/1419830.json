To solve this crisis, the Automatic Hero Provision System is used to summon the main character from the outside world. Now, he must borrow the unpredictable power of his home world to somehow fulfill his task.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Concept</strong></h2>This is a story that can only be told through the medium of games. For this reason, progression involves more than simply reading through the story. Reveal hidden objects and solve puzzles by interacting with elements on both sides of the game window...or even the window itself.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Controls</strong></h2>Double-click the icon that appears after running the game to start it. Advance text by clicking inside the main window. There are also certain operations can only be done at the OS level, so check thoroughly after reaching what seems like a dead end.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Setup</strong></h2><strong>It is highly recommended to play this game under Windows XP (Service Pack 3) compatibility mode.</strong><br><br><br>Select &quot;Out of Frame&quot; from the Steam client's library.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1419830/extras/67dbae9ffb1046dfafaebc2f67ddde2b.avif?t=1601569321\" width=418 height=280 /></span><br>Click the Settings icon then choose &quot;View local files&quot; under Manage to open the installation folder.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1419830/extras/958e2ecaab356aeeec059b1948f85251.avif?t=1601569321\" width=494 height=396 /></span><br>Right-click on Out_of_Frame.exe and select Properties from the menu.<br>Under the Compatibility tab, check the compatibility mode box and select Windows XP (Service Pack 3).<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1419830/extras/2e0901d4aad5f3416449b660c60e5010.avif?t=1601569321\" width=362 height=438 /></span><br>Please note that operation is not guaranteed in any other mode.<br><br>Then double click on the Out_of_Frame.exe file to launch the game.",
