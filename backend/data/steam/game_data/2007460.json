    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What is Boralaa?</h2>Boralaa is a <strong>turn-based Boss Rush Game</strong> with Souls-like elements. To unravel the mysteries of Boralaa, you must go through the <strong>Bosses</strong>. But the hero's life isn't easy, as you have to figure out how to defeat them as the turns go by. <strong>Zero help, just your attention and strategy!</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Multiplayer</h2>You can play with and against your friends. Or if you're a streamer, live with and against your community.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Lore Focused</h2>Boralaa was created with the idea of <i>lore first</i>: the story was created first and the game was developed around it. We believe that a rich story is a huge source of entertainment, both inside and outside of the game. And we want to create an experience as good as other games have brought to us.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Lore</h2>During a fateful day, a voice was heard by everyone. It didn't matter the place, race or age. Everyone in Boralaa listened in sync to the truth that changed the future of that people.<br><br><i>&quot;Roar, adapt, curse, and bless.&quot;<br>&quot;Surpass the abomination.&quot;<br>&quot;Pain is Ordeal.&quot;</i><br><br>And so a light began to shine. An indication from the heavens informing the place. The location where everything will happen, with the prophecy set in stone. A counter displayed the number 365: the time until the first calamity appears.",
