    "description": "Flashover MegaSector is a shoot 'em up built to look like a browser game from roughly a decade ago. Simplistic shapes, tons of gradients, simple yet intriguing mechanics, and engaging level design are present to try to remind one of browser games, while still doing its best to just plain be a good shoot 'em up along the way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe demo version features the first level of the game, allowing you to see if the game runs properly on your system, and allowing you to gauge if you like the game before you purchase it. We hope you enjoy it!",
