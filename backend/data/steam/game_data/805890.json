The world is your sandbox and you can choose to rise to the top or fall with the weak. Vitality is a game which places you into a fictional world at the dawn of human civilization, faced with the task of guiding your people through the tests of time.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Vitality is a game designed to take you on a journey across human history as you progress in skills and knowledge. In Vitality, you will explore three distinct ages through the guidance of a loosely structured narrative—each providing a unique thematic focus and gameplay experience. Grounded in its atmosphere, Vitality features many familiar mechanics popular to the sandbox genre—each tailored specifically to ensure a unique, fulfilling, and enjoyable experience. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Release Information</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >As of January 2025, Vitality is currently being rewritten from the ground up in a new custom engine. While we had hoped to get the game out much sooner (years ago!) we believe reviving the project through a new rewrite will truly unlock the ambitious vision we originally had for the game!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The tentative release target is Fall 2026, with Alpha/Beta testing phases starting in Summer 2026. Please join our Discord server to follow development updates!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Gameplay Synopsis &amp; Core Mechanics:</strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Vitality Age Progression</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Vitality features three distinct &quot;ages&quot; meant to reflect the historical eras of human civilization. Each age is built upon the progression of the previous and feature distinct gameplay focuses and thematic objectives. Akin to “chapters” of an overarching narrative, the different ages are designed to guide the player through interesting mechanics, unique situations, and an evolving world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Stone Age</strong> – The Stone Age is the first age you will encounter as you begin your journey in Vitality. Rough, tough, and unforgiving, the Stone Age is depicts our earliest struggles as an emergent hunter-gatherer species. With some creative liberties taken—such as the inclusion of dinosaurs and other prehistoric beasts—the Stone Age is designed to test one’s abilities to survive. The Stone Age introduces you to the beginnings of the NPC quest and posse systems, the <i>Vitality</i> health &amp; survival meter, and many other supplementary survival-based mechanics.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Medieval Age</strong> – Given time, the small tribes of the past expand and conquer, spreading their influence throughout the region. With growing numbers, advancing technology, and a thirst for power, empires form and castles scatter the lands. The Medieval Age throws you into an era of royalty—one split by the dynamics of wealth and poverty. The Medieval Age truly is a time of knights and squires!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Industrial Age</strong> – Medieval Age technology cannot support the growth of civilization indefinitely, making it necessary to invent, advance, and automate. The Industrial Age puts you in a time of rapid technological development—thematically focused on a steampunk-esque style.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Advanced NPC Mechanics</strong> </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Quests</strong> – NPC quests are a pillar of Vitality’s core gameplay. Quests are intended to both guide you through a loosely structured narrative as well as gain NPC favor.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Favor</strong> – Your favor with NPCs is not a given. Instead, you must increase NPC favor by completing their quests, supporting the village, and improving their lives. While low favor NPCs may attack you and your tribe if provoked, high favor NPCs offer many perks!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Posse System</strong> – Beyond quests, NPCs can join you as useful sidekicks in your adventures—if you can earn it, that is. NPCs can be recruited to join your party. While in your party, NPCs will follow you around the world and provide various gameplay perks based on their specializations. For example, hunter NPC’s will aid you in exploring untamed wilds, miner NPCs will help you navigate through cave systems to rich ore, and healers can attempt to revive you if you meet an unfortunate fate.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Building, Crafting, &amp; Knowledge</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Building &amp; Crafting</strong> – Vitality features standard building &amp; crafting mechanics typical of the genre. Blocks, items, furniture, and utility objects can be collected and crafted as you explore and advance in the game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Recipe Books</strong> – Crafting recipes (in Story Mode) are discovered through the collection of “knowledge books” that you acquire as you play the game. Obtained through exploration, quest rewards, and skill tree fulfillment, recipe books create an intuitive way to expand your crafting knowledge and capabilities. Recipe books also provide general information about items and their mechanics.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Multiplayer</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Vitality will also feature an online multiplayer co-op mode, fully compatible with the main “story” as described above. Vitality's multiplayer mode is optimized to be be played between groups of friends sized 2-8.  </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Community &amp; Contact</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >If you want to follow the development of the game more closely, or chat with us about the project, join our Discord server!</p>",
