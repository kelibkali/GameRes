    "description": "We Walked in Darkness is a 2.5D side scrolling platformer where you play as two sibling slaves trying to escape to the north via the Underground Railroad. Fourteen year old Grace knows how to read and write and is very intelligent. Eight year old Elijah is smaller and can fit within small spaces. They were born on a plantation in Georgia. Both have to stealth their way through obstacles like slave hunters and bloodhounds, as well as solve puzzles to escape while enduring the hardships of traveling as escaped slaves in a place where everything is against them.<br />\r\nWe Walked in Darkness aims to teach people the hardships of what it was like to escape through the Underground Railroad.",
