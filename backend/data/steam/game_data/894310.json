Two years later, Abbie vanished. At the same time, a towering spire emerged, stretching from the ocean’s depths to beyond the sky. &quot;Heaven's Door&quot;, as some called it, caused the oceans to flood, submerging cities, kingdoms and even entire continents.<br><br>---<br><br><i>Finding Light</i> follows the tale of Mari and her quest to find her beloved partner Abbie and solve the mystery of Heaven's Door. Joined by the wise cleric Keller, the former knight Stray and Malady the witch, Mari must travel beyond the sky, through the ocean's depths and deep underground to find the entrance to Heaven's Door and find her partner before the world succumbs to darkness.<br><i><br>Finding Light</i> is a stand-alone game as well as the fourth entry in the <i>Knights of Ambrose Saga.</i>",
