Here, life revolves around a single tree, its fruit the only source of nourishment, its presence both sacred and strange. Each ritual feast brings smiles and serenity to all who partake, washing away worry and will alike. Yet as Trask takes root among them, a question begins to grow: what lies beyond the light of the tree?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Untangle the Mystery of the Leaf</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Trask awakens among a group of other Orgions, a race of plant-like people. This group, the Leaf, worships a radiant tree deep within a cavern of eternal glow. Its fruit feeds them. Its light comforts them. And its presence keeps them docile and obedient.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Something stirring beneath the roots.</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The others call it peace. She calls it a prison.<br> What is this place and why does no one want to leave?</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Become an Orgion</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Grow to escape by absorbing the essence of the creatures you encounter and unlock new abilities that let you explore deeper into the Leaf’s hollow heart.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Every choice matters</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Trust cautiously, explore carefully, and question everything, even the warmth and bliss that the tree provides. The deeper Trask goes, the clearer it becomes: escaping the Leaf may mean confronting the mysteries of the outside world… and surviving what waits beyond may change her forever.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p>",
