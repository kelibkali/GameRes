    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Set deep within Canada’s frozen boreal wilderness, <strong>The Cabin</strong> is a 2D survival game where every tree you fell and every cabin you raid has lasting consequences. Society has crumbled after a mysterious catastrophe swept through the South, and like many others, you've fled into the vast and unforgiving North—seeking solitude, safety, and survival in your remote family cabin.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >But you're not alone.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🌲 <strong>Survive the Wild</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The harsh winter is only the beginning. You'll need to hunt, scavenge, chop wood, and manage your supplies carefully. The forest is rich with resources—but it's also alive. Overharvesting leads to environmental degradation, scaring off wildlife and leaving the land barren. Every decision affects the world around you. Will you live in balance with nature… or bleed it dry to survive?</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🔥 <strong>Resource Management Meets Consequence</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Balance your firewood, food, and ammunition. Store supplies for brutal cold snaps, cook meals, and maintain your cabin. But be warned—hoarding too much may attract attention from others trying to survive by any means necessary.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >⚔️ <strong>Trust No One</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Other survivors wander the forest. Some are desperate. Some are violent. Some belong to the <strong>Cultists</strong>, a fanatical group that stalks the woods, whispering prayers to an unseen force. Raiding abandoned cabins might offer temporary relief, but if the owners are alive… they <i>will</i> come looking for revenge. Every encounter could be your last.</p>",
