She has to become a player: bargain, maneuver, gather information, and decide who can be trusted with not only her freedom, but her vulnerability too.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >She has one advantage no one around her has: memories of the future. That knowledge can be a weapon… or the reason they start suspecting she’s lying.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Six dangerous men. Seven deadly sins.

Young, reckless and sure of himself, Ray is danger and charisma wrapped into one. His sharp grin and blood-red eyes make your pulse jump and your instincts tense up. He keeps his cool in any situation, laughs in the face of threats and lives by his own rules. Fear doesn’t seem to exist for him. He’s always one step ahead, and you’d better not get in his way.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Age:</strong> 25<br><strong>Height:</strong> 5'9&quot; (~175 cm)<br><strong>Gang #</strong> 1<br><strong>Color:</strong> Red<br><strong>Sin:</strong> Greed</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4314300/extras/260234d3d883e0a79493e5a90dc91a4c.avif?t=1771152805\" width=390 height=500 /></span></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4314300/extras/af2ad8acb4ab8c32394971f866ca9171.avif?t=1771152805\" width=390 height=75 /></span></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The kind of guy who feels familiar at first glance. Warm, open, almost country-sweet— like he wandered into gangster life by accident. In reality, he’s one of Ray’s key men. A soft half-smile and an attentive look make him easy to trust. Dan’s the first to offer help, the first to throw you a friendly word, never pushing or intimidating. Even the hardest moments feel a little lighter around him. But is that simplicity hiding something else?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Age:</strong> 24<br><strong>Height:</strong> 5'9&quot; (~176 cm)<br><strong>Gang #</strong> 2<br><strong>Color:</strong> Orange<br><strong>Sin:</strong> Envy</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4314300/extras/cee14e6f4a23d27c849882887b615cb8.avif?t=1771152805\" width=390 height=500 /></span></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4314300/extras/727f979a64dd39b4a6122550f5b58f1f.avif?t=1771152805\" width=390 height=75 /></span></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A mysterious outsider. Calm and quiet, Lei keeps to himself even among his own. His looks and manners give away his Eastern roots at once. Every movement shows discipline and restraint, and his gaze feels like it’s reading you through. Lei avoids loud talk and prefers to act from the shadows. Yet that silent strength is exactly what draws you in, making you wonder what he’s hiding behind that composure.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Age:</strong> 24<br><strong>Height:</strong> 6'0&quot; (~183 cm)<br><strong>Gang #</strong> 3<br><strong>Color:</strong> Green<br><strong>Sin:</strong> Despondency</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4314300/extras/8c19b153ab7998c231699a32f5097c29.avif?t=1771152805\" width=390 height=500 /></span></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4314300/extras/2aec85d4e22afa25081c713b7c18d867.avif?t=1771152805\" width=390 height=75 /></span></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >An elegant aristocrat in a criminal world. Always impeccably dressed, with an ironic gaze and a quiet smile. Will doesn’t rely on brute force. His weapons are intellect, cunning, and flawless manners. A light tease and sharp wordplay turn every conversation into a duel. And when Will becomes dangerous, it happens so smoothly you won’t even notice the exact moment he crossed the line.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Age:</strong> 26<br><strong>Height:</strong> 5'9&quot; (~176 cm)<br><strong>Gang #</strong> 4<br><strong>Color:</strong> Purple<br><strong>Sin:</strong> Lust</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4314300/extras/1afcdc3b311ed9d297ad3a9f32a77456.avif?t=1771152805\" width=390 height=500 /></span></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4314300/extras/22a3cd68231420b730c2b10da1d842ac.avif?t=1771152805\" width=390 height=75 /></span></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The most silent and unreadable of the bunch. Tall, stern, with a distant, icy stare, Low seems to keep an invisible wall between himself and the rest of the world. There’s more power in his quiet than in a dozen threats, and his calm can turn into ruthless resolve in a heartbeat. He rarely shows emotion and prefers to stay on the sidelines. But beneath that armor is a man with a hard past. He’s difficult to hurt with words— and even harder to truly understand.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Age:</strong> 28<br><strong>Height:</strong> 5'11&quot; (~180 cm)<br><strong>Gang #</strong> 5<br><strong>Color:</strong> Blue<br><strong>Sin:</strong> Wrath</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4314300/extras/880ac15e38af86528c34b9ecfdf57f75.avif?t=1771152805\" width=390 height=500 /></span></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4314300/extras/2f38545aa2ff03f0c315dcc886c5afd1.avif?t=1771152805\" width=390 height=75 /></span></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >At first glance, he seems like the harmless youngest one. Simple, smiley, always ready to crack a joke and keep the conversation going— Ernie quickly becomes the “heart of the group.” He’s easy to be around. His friendliness disarms you, his humor cuts the tension. He seems genuinely happy to be part of the team and willing to help anyone. But sometimes there’s a flicker in his eyes you’d rather not notice— as if a secret is hiding behind the habit of being convenient.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Age:</strong> 22<br><strong>Height:</strong> 5'7&quot; (~171 cm)<br><strong>Gang #</strong> 6<br><strong>Color:</strong> Yellow<br><strong>Sin:</strong> Gluttony</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4314300/extras/0417f5fe8de0a63c7af472373d662172.avif?t=1771152805\" width=390 height=75 /></span></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4314300/extras/3b9901a9f6e2aa31fb2629161305dc05.avif?t=1771152805\" width=390 height=500 /></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4314300/extras/ad4bc2a56d524abc79fdad1d438212f4.avif?t=1771152805\" width=390 height=75 /></span></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A girl out of time. Fragile on the outside, surprisingly strong within. Lia is determined to survive without dissolving into someone else’s story. Here, she belongs to no one— and her past is unknown to everyone. A cold mind paired with the ability to support the people beside her. Pride, inner kindness, and desperate courage woven together. A ghost of a former life who still chooses to be the heroine of her own story.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Age:</strong> 20<br><strong>Height:</strong> 5'3&quot; (~160 cm)<br><strong>Color:</strong> Pink<br><strong>Sin:</strong> Pride</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4314300/extras/20c37480bf20325f86f36c41fa0ebb99.avif?t=1771152805\" width=390 height=75 /></span></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Otome visual novel in a 1920s crime-noir setting</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Branching story with choices that truly change the outcome</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Six romance routes and two thematic paths: <strong>Redemption / Fall</strong></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Period atmosphere: Prohibition, a port city, underground deals, and streets where everyone has a secret</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Intrigue, blackmail, psychological tension, and romance that doesn’t promise safety</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4314300/extras/bff7390f9610d40e0353de790ffca53d.avif?t=1771152805\" width=390 height=75 /></span></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >If you love stories where romance doesn’t erase danger, where characters aren’t neatly split into “good” and “bad,” and where love can be a trial rather than salvation— <strong>Sinful Testament</strong> is made for you. </p>",
