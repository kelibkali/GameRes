Dell's 1984 classic game Drugwars, where the player goes around New York City trying to make as much money as possible selling drugs while evading the police.  But this isn't New York City.  Or 1984.  The Dope Game takes place in the fictional city of Starkham, Blannington; a staple in the CoaguCo universe.<br><br>To escape the city of Starkham and start your new life, you get your friend Preston to set up a meeting with the local loanshark, Sweaty Mike.  After foolishly borrowing $2,000, you embark on a timed mission to sell as many illicit substances as possible throughout the city.  However, you must evade the police, make sure not to enrage the locals, and navigate an ever-changing drug market.<br><br>Visit locations like Crockfort, Pinky's Gun Emporium, Murphy's Lake, The Noose &amp; Rafter Bar, Hillside, Saint Jaysus Memorial Hospital, and more to interact with people and trade in a variety of drugs.  Almost everyone you meet can be fought or bartered with in some manner.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/466800/extras/fc0e0fec1465986979241613d054d68d.avif?t=1711094757\" width=616 height=76 /></span><br>The newly remastered game features original music by Macabre Gandhi and fully hand-drawn art assets by GP Garcia.
