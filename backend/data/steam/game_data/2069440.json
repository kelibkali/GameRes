    "description": "Pindeavor takes overhead action-RPG style mechanics and themes them along pinball-like powers. Bump, bounce, roll, and reflect obstacles as you make your way through 9 dungeons, facing off against enemies, bosses, and lots of balls and bricks. Without a weapon, you have to dodge your way around hazards, bounce enemies out of the way, use pinballs to open paths forward, and uncover upgrades so you can make your way to the witch causing all the trouble. Because you yourself are a completely innocent adventurer in all of this mess. When life hands you a hefty ballgown, you make pinball out of it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWindows 10 or higher may be required to run games made in this version of GameMaker Studio.",
