Then you have one little mid-air collision, and you never hear the end of it...&quot;</i></strong> <i>—Air Traffic Controller, New York TRACON, Westbury Long Island</i><br><br>You are a hot new Air Traffic Controller, eager to prove yourself and show off your skills to the world. Sure, you are brilliantly gifted. But are you safe? Can you handle real pressure? You are the world's last line of defense against inevitable air disaster! You are paid the big bucks for your visualization skills and guts. Just like the real job of an air traffic controller, you must pay attention and keep your eyes moving. There is always something that you should be doing. Give takeoff clearances, landing clearances and taxi clearances in a strategic effort to maintain safety and efficiency where there would otherwise be total chaos. This is not a spectator's sport! Can you hack it?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/387850/extras/fec4880bfe533b0978d1c2b43e42354d.avif?t=1447377130\" width=600 height=332 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Air Traffic Control: The World's Most Stressful Job</h2><br><br>Airport Madness 4 offers human pilot voices, bad weather, emergencies, aircraft carriers, plus a radar scope. Helicopters, float planes, F15 fighter jets, and space shuttles are just a few of the aircraft you will handle.  It offers you 12 unique challenges, plus some very unusual activity at an 'Area 51' airport.  This is a must-have game for any aviation enthusiast. It's incredibly simple to learn, yet insanely addictive and challenging. More than 100,000 copies of Airport Madness have been sold to date.<br><br>Choose from six unique airports, including a dozen different airport challenges. Our revamped physics engine offers smoother motion and more realistic aircraft behavior. The addition of several new aircraft will challenge your ability to recognize performance differences between different aircraft types, such as the Boeing 747, Airbus A380 and even the Concorde. <br><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>    Real human pilot voices<br></li><li>    6 awesome levels<br></li><li>    Radar<br></li><li>    Emergencies<br></li><li>    Nasty weather<br></li><li>    12 ridiculous challenges </li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Keep 'em separated!</h2><br><br>Air Traffic Control is a talent. It's a skill that you are hopefully born with. Much like that of a heart surgeon, you take people's lives into your own hands when you are at the radar scope. Strive to keep the traffic moving, but don't let 'em hit. Push yourself to handle the traffic! Work quickly, but be cautious.<br><br>If you like this game, you must also try <strong><i>Airport Madness: World Edition</i></strong> on Steam!<br><br>",
