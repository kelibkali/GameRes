The simplicity/complexity ratio is just right – you don’t try to get too fancy but there are also enough elements that can be mixed and matched that the game stays fresh.”<br><br>“Lovely design and tons of content, it feels like a love letter to PopCap, and that’s meant in the most complimentary ways.”<br><br>“I really like the art for this game. I’m a big fan of the classic Universal monster aesthetic, and the game has a lot of fun with these different types of creatures.”",
