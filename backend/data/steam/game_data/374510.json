    "description": "<strong>Now includes free DLC &quot;Sacred Line&quot; (standalone game). Linux / SteamOS version has minor exclusive content (two Linux-themed voiced lines in the game).</strong><br><br><i>&quot;As if George Carlin lived in Russia and one day decided to make a mod for Postal 2 which would be based on the story of Only If. Well, that's a terrible pitch, but I'm tired. Now would you be so kind to get your fuckin' microphone out of my face, stop asking me about your fuckin' game and just let me go?&quot; - Random Man On The Street</i><br><br><i>&quot;Crap&quot;, &quot;Christianphobic trainwreck&quot;, &quot;Mess&quot; - Most trusted experts on the Internet</i><br><br>The Last Dogma is a surreal black comedy exploration adventure game set in the year 1999 of an alternate reality world, where US actively campaigns for world domination after being disappointed with the results of the Cold War. Inspired by the history of humankind, free of clichés and moral borders, made in Hell.<br><br>You play as Sebastian Arise, an ATF special agent tasked with the tracking and eradication of local firearms dealers. One day straightforward tracking mission turns into disaster, thrusting him into the village of cannibalistic Christian cult known as “Holy Intentions”. Entwined in a web of intrigues between emotion-feeding daemons, Sebastian must keep his senses sharp as he travels back in 1366 A.D. to stop the things he shouldn’t stop.<br><br><strong>!</strong><br>The game is a reimagining of Sacred Line Genesis, horror text adventure game for Sega Genesis / Mega Drive. And it's definitely not a shooter.<br>Recommended for fans of Killer7, Deadly Premonition, Only If, Postal, Normality and Pathologic (<i><strong>NOT</strong> INSPIRED</i> by them), for open-minded people who prefer story and exploration over action / mechanical gaming and for people who are still looking for secrets in the games they play.
