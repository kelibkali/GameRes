    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >D&amp;D Classics: Complete Priest's Handbook</h2>Clerics have long been among players' favorites, but now there are new priest characters for your gaming enjoyment! Within these pages are new rules for mythos-specific priests, guidelines for creating mythoi of your own, how-to's for making new priesthoods. Also here are new priest &quot;kits,&quot; so you can play a fighting monk, an amazon priestess, a savage priest, or even a peasant priest (among many others).<br><strong><br><i> We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today. Some older content may reflect ethnic, racial, and gender prejudice that were commonplace in American society at that time. These depictions were wrong then and are wrong today. This content is presented as it was originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed. Dungeons &amp; Dragons teaches that diversity is a strength, and we strive to make our D&amp;D products as welcoming and inclusive as possible. This part of our work will never end.</i></strong><br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Mike Wilson</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the D&amp;D Classics - AD&amp;D 1E/2E ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
