    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>The demo is limited to the first three levels, and one playable character.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Violet Impetus is a bullet-hell arcade melee 'em up set in a series of (lightly) procedurally-generated arenas. Drop into different biomes to rid the world of Æris—the demiurge, petrificate &amp; fractured.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >SKILL-BASED PROGRESSION</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Violet Impetus is <i>not</i> a roguelite! Instead, core to the design is emphasis on player skill—there's no meta shop with 5% damage and move-speed ups, no item unlocks, no choosing between three things. Progression is based solely on performance.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >DEVELOPED SCORING SYSTEM</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Increment multipliers by putting yourself at continuous risk of death. Eliminate foes just before their attacks (&quot;Clash&quot;) for the fast-fading mult CX, and graze just short of bullets for the slowly building GX. Avoid damage to increase your permanent PX. All on top of a system where basic survival is not so basic.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Or ignore it entirely!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >INFINITELY SPAWNING ARENAS</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Once per level, and only if you're quick enough, clash with enough enemies  to enter Apeiros. This is an infinite-spawning mode that only ends when you take damage or let your combo run out. Prove your skill against eternity.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >SINGLE- AND TWIN-STICK SUPPORT</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >While the core input methods are controller with two sticks or keyboard &amp; mouse, there's options to support single-stick play with hinted aim. This allows the game to be played on an arcade stick, single-handedly (on both controller and m&amp;k), or anything you've got with a stick and a few buttons.</p>",
