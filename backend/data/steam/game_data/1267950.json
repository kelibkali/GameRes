    "description": "Cosmic Flow is a relaxing visual experience, an audio-visual massage for the mind, a kaleidoscopic meditation. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCosmic Flow was developed by an artist as a first part of a series of VR experiences encouraging connection and personal expression. A relaxed mind is better able to understand and express itself. Cosmic Flow hopes to instill this feeling of relaxation so that, when the headset comes off, the feeling continues.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSit back, relax, and have a wonderful journey.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote from the author:<br />\r\nI'm currently working on adding interactive elements to this experience, stay tuned!",
