It’s the rarest, most precious thing in the universe – but the closer they get the more unstable they become. My idea was to create an immersive experience where the player is asked to try to understand the dynamics of this unusual relationship. The character you interact with adapts their behavior to yours – using academic terminology, they could set up “rage tests”, “love bombing&quot;, or otherwise guilt trip you. The plot's branching storyline is guided by variables such as “submission” and &quot;interest” that fluctuate at each interaction.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1302100/extras/48e305f286196109d9c4a431dca6f193.avif?t=1689753163\" width=256 height=64 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>    Semi-autobiographical dark romance story<br></li><li>    Branching narrative paths with multiple endings<br></li><li>    Intimate new sensory gameplay system<br></li><li>    Character art inspired by Suehiro Maruo and Masaaki Yuasa<br></li><li>    3D environments influenced by the stage design of Robert Wilson<br></li><li>    30+ minutes of baroque electropop original soundtrack</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1302100/extras/6dcebc271a5862d4ecb562e0cc461318.poster.avif?t=1689753163\" width=600 height=322 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1302100/extras/6dcebc271a5862d4ecb562e0cc461318.webm?t=1689753163\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1302100/extras/6dcebc271a5862d4ecb562e0cc461318.mp4?t=1689753163\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
