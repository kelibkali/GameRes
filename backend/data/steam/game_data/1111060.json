You're broke as heck and have moved to a place called Corpsefall to make your fortune!<br></li><li>Wouldn't you know it though, Corpsefall is a shanty town, and also broke as heck.<br></li><li>Looks like you'll need to harvest resources, craft your wares, and sell them to make that dough, then build the town up from nothing.<br></li><li>Let's throw some townspeople into the mix! They're a weird lot, and you're gonna meet them all.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1111060/extras/a180aca43cffc923cd36e9d8cb6a63d8.avif?t=1671215290\" width=414 height=102 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Make some friends, man! </h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Maybe help that insecure Duopus find her inner sea monster.<br></li><li>I hear the Arena Master is looking for blood, just a pint or two.<br></li><li>Rule of threes, baby!

Corpsefall isn't your typical RPG/Farming Sim, it's also an operating software.<br></li><li><i>&quot;That doesn't make sense!&quot;</i> you exclaim, and yeah, you're right. Check out the screenshots, cause they illustrate it better.<br></li><li>Drag those townspeople around your desktop, they don't mind.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Town upgrades install more townspeople and unlock things to do like:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Gardening <br></li><li>Arena running<br></li><li>Dungeon diving<br></li><li>And more</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Right, email. </h2>You've got a little mail center app! Use it to chat with the townspeople, fulfill requests, and hand out reaction icons. <br>So get to brewing! You've got a shanty town to rebuild.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>This game has been my first venture into pixel art and programming, so all feedback is welcome!
