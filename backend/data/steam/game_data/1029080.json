The less sense it makes - the better.<br><br>Some robots however were on maintaince, so they stayed normal.<br>You take control of one of such machines and try to take down these robo-cults before they ruin the Station and get us all vanished for good.<br><strong>You can only move from wall to wall</strong>, so plan your maneuvers while shooting mad cans.<br><strong>Find the equipment</strong> to shoot big bad ball of whatever kills the enemies, or just keeps you a few seconds longer in your struggle.",
