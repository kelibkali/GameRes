    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Endless RPG is a random map and adventure generator for Dungeons and Dragons 2024 and 5e. It is intended as a toolkit for solo play D&amp;D as well as an aid for dungeon masters.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This random map generator is <strong>not a game</strong>. It is a tool for playing tabletop pen-and-paper role-playing games (TTRPG). Endless RPG allows you to play solo DnD or quickly create maps and encounters. It does not perform combat or resolve challenges.  Instead, the player reports back their failure or success.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Supports D&amp;D 2024 including the Monster Manual 2025. Also includes support for 5e as a primary system and as an expansion to D&amp;D 2024.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Over 200 monster groups</strong> (orc, goblin, drow, etc.) including advanced groups that can <u>level in a class</u> (orc wizard, goblin thief, drow monk).</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Encounter variety includes itemization (even magical items) and augments that can range from being bigger or stronger to being a <strong>7-legged spider or having more potent venom</strong></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Create random dungeons, caves, ruins, crypts, tombs, strongholds, keeps, etc. Maps can have additional themes such as being <i>mystic, unholy, military, in ruins, or abandoned</i></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Custom maps allow you to specify a primary, secondary, and a boss enemy, so you can have a <strong>necromancer raising a group of skeletons to bully orcs into searching a cavern for treasure</strong></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Custom encounter mode skips the map to just roll custom encounters/treasure</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Quick missions will roll up a map with a random enemy  in a random location  </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Quick Battle and Battle Map modes for helping with combat.   </p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>*** PLAY D&amp;D SOLO OR IN A GROUP WITHOUT A DM ***</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The primary focus of Endless RPG is solo players looking for a tool that will help them play DnD alone.  It is also designed for small groups that do not have a dedicated Dungeon Master but still want to go on fun adventures.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Maps are explored through a fog-of-war discovery system with encounters, traps, tricks, and treasures displayed as you encounter them.  This is perfect for solo play or groups without a DM as you will get no hints of what is behind the next door.  (Unless you cast Clairvoyance!) </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Custom Dungeons allow you to pick the CR level, environment (dungeon, cave, etc.), primary and secondary enemies (orcs, undead, demons, etc.), and an overall difficulty level.  Map types can also have themes such as mystic, unholy, military, etc.  These themes can even affect the types of creatures found within: a mystic tower with mercenaries may hold some conjurers summoning demons while a military tower might be lighter on the use of magic.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You can also choose Quick Mission for a random location and enemy groups. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Want to use your own solo tools?</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You can also use Endless RPG in encounter mode, which lets you roll up encounters and treasure without the need for a map.  This gives you access to advanced monster groups that are both leveled in a class and equipped with weapons and armor.  The creatures found can also have common or unusual modifiers such as being sick or injured, being a huge version or having more potent poison that does additional damage.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>*** RANDOM ENCOUNTERS, TREASURES, TRICKS, TRAPS AND WINDOW DRESSINGS</strong> ***</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >What would exploring be without some treasure and traps?  Endless RPG supports multiple expansions that add to both encounters and treasures that can be found on the random map.  And beyond treasures, encounters and traps, there are various other obstacles to overcome from a mud-drenched cave floor to a cursed temple.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>*** QUICK BATTLE AND BATTLE MAPS FOR COMBAT MANAGEMENT***</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >While Endless RPG is not intended to replace your favorite combat management app, it does have a few management tools in place to use as aids.  The app will help keep track of hit points at all times while you are adventuring.  When dealing with encounters, you can also choose to use a Quick Combat screen, which tracks initiative and hit points or all combatants, or a Battle Map, which also tracks where combatants are in relation to each other.   </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >  </p>",
