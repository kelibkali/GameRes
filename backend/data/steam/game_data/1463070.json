Although most of the cat army is made up of unqualified grunts clinging to the impossible dream of obtaining a full-time job with benefits, there are also some skilled and bloodthirsty fighters among their ranks who will stop at nothing to fulfill their duty. However, these cats aren't the only ones with a bachelor's degree in kicking butt - the local resistance continues to stand in the way of the army's plans for world domination.  Team up with a cast of unusual characters who make up the resistance and help them take down the cats once and for all - but don't forget about your own story and goals along the way.",
