Each commander has a their own unique card deck, with abilities that utilize the battlefields in different ways.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765700/extras/9d9b3c0b424bb6eda4e0ee6d8d120c08.avif?t=1755422595\" width=616 height=127 /></span><br><br>The battlefield is always changing in this real-time strategy game, so unit positioning is key.

Delores specializes in defending her units and keeping them in tip top shape.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765700/extras/d00a28cb361f23d784ad8881c9082bde.webp?t=1755422595\" width=616 height=55 /></span><br>Next, we have <strong>Zubair the Cunning!</strong> This dastardly free agent uses his greed to propel him to riches!

All units move along the hex grid, each with different strengths, weaknesses, attack ranges and abilities. As the game proceeds in real time, you and your opponents will be constantly racing to see who can outsmart who first. Can you break through your opponent’s defenses before they break through yours? Can you solve the complicated puzzle of each new terrain makeup before they figure out a killer strategy? Get ready to flex that analytical brain!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765700/extras/a460ca84f23adb4c395068af066b6392.avif?t=1755422595\" width=616 height=95 /></span><br><br>While galactical warfare breaks out across the planet, your deployment ship will remain stationed in the sky above, firing new units down in drop pods and providing visibility to the tiles beneath. The fun part is that aside from your units, you can control your ship as well, moving it where necessary to deploy units exactly where you want them. But be careful - it takes time for drop pods to open up, and they’re vulnerable to enemy fire. You need to protect your reinforcements!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765700/extras/9fc5840fb2e9c9c17f03aa1b417391c9.webp?t=1755422595\" width=616 height=55 /></span><br><br>Want to become the strongest in the galaxy? Jump into cross-platform multiplayer mode and crush all your friends in 1v1 or 2v2 matches!

Complete with wacky animated scenes just like a real Saturday morning cartoon, this mode will entertain you and teach you how to efficiently play as each different character. The AI will also pose a decent challenge, preparing you for your battles against human opponents!",
