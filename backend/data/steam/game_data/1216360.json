    "description": "In order to treat a fear of fruits and vegetables, also known as fructophobia and lachanophobia, this program allows the client to gradually get used to these food items. The therapist has control over a number of options. They can drop a variety of fruits or vegetables in a fruit bowl in front of the client. The bowl can be moved closer and further away from the client, and all fruits and vegetables in the scene can be removed in an instant. With most fruits and vegetables, there’s an option to create a cut or opened version of the item. Currently uncuttable items the therapist can choose from are: Cucumber, Garlic, and Onion. The available, cuttable items are: Apple, Banana, Kiwi, Melon, Orange, and Strawberry.",
