Each playable character finds itself in their own part of the world with the same problem…<br><br>Use battery to see with your light and memory to draw lines on the screen, but be careful as these are limited resources.<br><br>How far will you go before you run out of the battery power or memory needed to overcome the darkness?<br><br>Classic aesthetic with keyboard menu navigation interface. Recommended to play in a dark room.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/662690/extras/7bc0a52299355cf3351dc2f60d008191.webp?t=1499358875\" width=260 height=50 /></span><br><br>Unlock new characters the more you play. Three different robots, each with their own procedurally generated levels and unique abilities:<br>- Reggie — Just a regular robot with a light switch.<br>- LineRider — More than meets the eye, he can walk on the lines he draws.<br>- Anti-Grav — He’s a little mixed up; go up when he falls and down when he jumps.<br><br>Two modes of play:<br>- Normal mode — See how far you can get before you run out of resources or fall to your doom.<br>- Time Attack — Get as far as you can in 60 seconds.<br><br>With 7 achievements to unlock!<br><br>Advance far enough and you may uncover the secret of this dark world…",
