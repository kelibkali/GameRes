    "description": "Do you like blowing things up? So do I, that's the reason my dog Otis and I made this game.  Star Saga One is a fast-paced space style shoot-em-up that takes place at an orbital mine station in the middle of nowhere.  It features 3 different weapon types and a personal shield when things get real hairy. This game has you pitted against hordes of deep space drones, each wave more challenging than the last. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour weapons include your standard Blaster Pistol, the Wolf-PPK, with included rapid fire mode.  The Ram-PPK Polarizer, which temporarily inverts your enemies target.  The last is the Hart-PPK EMP grenade when you're surrounded and you need to take out more than you have time to. Your digital defense is a personal crystalline shield made from liquid diamond, but even it won't protect you if a strategy isn't on your side.",
