There's not only every animal's personal problem a gnome has to deal with — as mysteriously dark, unprecedented things start happening in the forest; the source of which no one really understands. Fear, escaping and destruction taint the previously peaceful life of the animals. Seemingly only one can stop this — but what can a single gnome really do to save the world?<br><br><i>A Most Extraordinary Gnome</i> is a short, narrative-driven game, which combines challenging and unique 2D action with complex storytelling. You control a small gnome, who uses his hat to defeat the dangers he encounters in increasingly intense stages.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2089710/extras/33abddda910dae29d33485fb53d98261.poster.avif?t=1673192626\" width=630 height=354 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2089710/extras/33abddda910dae29d33485fb53d98261.webm?t=1673192626\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2089710/extras/33abddda910dae29d33485fb53d98261.mp4?t=1673192626\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The features of the game</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2089710/extras/a724349ea99e085e8a2be692dd3a154f.webp?t=1673192626\" width=630 height=14 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Unlike anything you've seen in indie gaming!</strong><br>A colorful and vibrant 2D world, made entirely out of hand crafted paper cut-out elements<br></li><li><strong>Gameplay tailored just to you</strong><br>Whether you're looking for a laid-back experience or a harder challenge, gameplay settings are there to accommodate your needs!<br></li><li><strong>A deep story!</strong><br>There's more than what just meets the eye.
