You travel via a being named Keu through 7 different planets, unraveling the complex mess of reality ahead of you. But as you read through the alien literature, discover archaic long lost ruins, and delve your thoughts into the unfamiliar languages of the galaxy, you start to realise the 'dark virus' people fear might not be what you expect.</i></strong></h2> <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/867660/extras/d58b51283b1c7dfb2e233e3a59fe93c1.avif?t=1666082524\" width=600 height=300 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/867660/extras/7723b52ce93cd0174a5e85f44d7dc1d2.webp?t=1666082524\" width=150 height=24 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong><i>The game was developed by one person, EDG, over the span of 8 years, all while learning how to make games at the same time.
