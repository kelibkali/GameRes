    "description": "<strong>Zombies, Upbeat Music, Retro Craziness, Nutty Beats!! </strong> This is the original, first music score for the Game, Bloody Zombies. It was composed by Daniel Sadowski.  The Album is a mix of beats, retro music, and lots of crazy synthesizers. Some of the tracks are unreleased so it adds a different flavor to the album. It has 13 tracks. Most of them can be played in endless loop mode, and they will repeat nicely. Enjoy!!",
