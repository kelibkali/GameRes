With no memory of their reason for being there, players are forced to fight for their survival through a hellish catastrophe while frantically seeking answers to discover the truth behind their identity and unveil the mystery surrounding the horrific true purpose of the complex.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Venture</strong> into the [I]Triglav Complex[/I]: an abandoned, cold war era, soviet military research base whose original purpose involved developmental weapons. Now, the derelict compound is operating once again with similar intent. A dreadfully dangerous and highly classified chemical weapon known only as [I]Morana[/I] has been under design for years, but has become too difficult to control and containment has been breached.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Experience</strong> the terrifying possibilities of human experimentation, biological manipulation, and chemical warfare from a first person perspective. The game features many different locations to explore including a disturbing research facility, a dark wilderness, a desolate city, and more.
