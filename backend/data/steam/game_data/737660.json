    "description": "Greetings, player! My name is Mr. Thee, and you seem to have stumbled upon the Steam page of my game! The screenshots should've given this away by now, but I'll happily give you a quick rundown. <strong>The Deepest House</strong> is an early-access, sleek and squishy, top-down, 3D, action-roguelike game featuring a variety of game modes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Game Modes</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Arcade Mode</strong> (1 Player): In arcade mode, you play as a small, ostensibly-indie hooded small character and have to make your way through 4 procedurally-generated treacherous dungeons. Collect a wide variety of strange and exotic weapons and tools to best whatever foes get in your way! The rooms, spawns, treasure, and even the protagonist color are randomized for each play-through to ensure optimal replayability.<br></li><li> <strong>Target Attack</strong> (1 Player): Destroy a series of pre-configured targets as fast as you can with a pre-determined loadout.<br></li><li> <strong>Challenge Rooms</strong> (1 Player): Test your understanding of the game's mechanics to overcome a set of dastardly scenarios, ranging from timed escape rooms to armed (and unarmed) combat challenges.<br></li><li> <strong>Horde Mode</strong> (1-4 Players): Team-up with up to 3 friends locally to survive waves of incoming enemies. Head to the merchant in between waves of enemies to buy new gear. You and your friends can revive each other as often as you want, but if everyone kicks the bucket, then it's game over.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Combat 101</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Items: 2 weapons slots (one melee, one ranged), 3 armor slots (head, neck, cloak) and 5 inventory slots for various tools such as potions and bombs.<br></li><li>Most weapons, armor, and enemies come with various elemental and status attributes. Learn which tools are the best for dispatching your foes.<br></li><li>Advanced techniques include: dodge rolls for evading attacks and melee strikes that can reflect enemy (and player) projectiles!</li></ul>",
