    "description": "Player's Eleven enables a completely new football manager feeling that has never existed before. Instead of automatically taking on every role in the club, Player's Eleven breaks new ground by leaving the choice of club roles completely up to the player. You think the head coach job is boring? Then concentrate on transfers and negotiations as sports director. You want to be the boss of the club, but don't feel like merchandising, negotiating with sponsors or developing the infrastructure? Let someone else take over these tasks. You want to make a name for yourself as an U-19 coach in the youth sector? No problem, maybe the association will ask you to take over the U-21 national team!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The club roles</h2><br>Combine the following club roles as you wish:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Chairman of the board / President<br></li><li> Sporting director<br></li><li> Head coach<br></li><li> Second team coach<br></li><li> Youth coach<br></li><li> Economic Director<br></li><li> Head scout<br></li><li> National team coach (senior national team and U-21)</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The stakeholder system</h2><br>Player's Eleven lets you immerse yourself in the world of football by interacting with other protagonists, depending on the role you choose. The fans are persistently calling for you to be sacked as head coach? Hopefully the club president will not bow to this pressure. You have a good connection to the press? Maybe you can get yourself talked about at your favourite club. Your club is dependent on an investor, but he demands a new striker?  Let's see if you can satisfy him!<br><br>Different stakeholders have different interests in your club. Who will prevail? The following stakeholders are foreseen:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The clubboss (if you don't take this role)<br></li><li> The press<br></li><li> The sponsors<br></li><li> Investors<br></li><li> The fans</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Play international</h2><br>On every continent where football is played, you will be able to take over a club. Whether in South Africa, Argentina, Mexico, Australia, Japan or, of course, Europe: Player's Eleven is going international!",
