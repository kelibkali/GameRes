    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Super Space Shooter 2222: HyperSpace</h2>(you know like the year 2222, since the prequel was in 2077.. anyways)<br><br>Is a <strong>fast-paced <u>addicting</u></strong> endless <i>space shooter</i> with an inspiration taken from many modern games.<br><br>A project I have been passionately working <u>solo</u> for 2 years+ with some help from my friends including sprites for some skins, the bosses and dedicated soundtracks for them<br><br>Treat this game a little bit more as an <u>Early Access</u> product, even though its not marked as one, but it is not fully completely fleshed out with all of the features Id like it to have<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">  <li> <strong> 4 endless gamemodes</strong> where you can fight for the highest score on the <i>Leaderboards</i><br>    <ul class=\"bb_ul\">      <li> <strong>Arcade Mode</strong> - the main gamemode. Level up and unlock Modules to be as quick and as cool as possible in crushing all of your enemies and getting the highest score out there<br>      </li><li> <strong>Classic Mode</strong> - a throwback to the prequel I made when I was 14 years old, much simpler gameplay<br>      </li><li> <strong>Hardcore Mode</strong> - a more spiced up version of the Arcade; everything hits harder, besides you.. There is also a HackBarrier that prevents you from running too far away from your problems  : )<br>      </li><li> <strong>Meteor Madness</strong> - You're only left with your lightsaber, good luck surviving the endless Comet Storm<br>    </li></ul>  </li><li> <strong>Adventure Mode</strong> - A rogue-like campaign mode, where you travel through Zones and get strong enough to conquer <strong>Bosses</strong> and free the Amethyst Galaxy from the imminent doom of <i>The Singularity</i><br>  </li><li> <strong>Sandbox Mode / Spacebox</strong> - A (almost) working gamemode creator where you can edit a lot of values to make <u>your own type of experience</u> and share it with other players!<br>  </li><li> A unique progression system; The so called <i>Celestial Energy</i> is not only your XP, but also an asset used with some weapons or skills. After hitting a ceiling of this energy you manifest a <i>Power Core</i> used for Module &amp; Skill unlocks, and can <i><strong>Ascend</strong></i>, gaining a <i>Celestial Star</i>, that can be used for direct Ship stat upgrades<br>  </li><li> 26+ Ship <i>skins</i> and a hell lot of total combinations with other <u>customization</u> options<br>  </li><li> 3 <strong>Banger soundtracks</strong> from SiriusBeat and climactic OSTs by Lidkas for each Boss you encounter<br>  </li><li> <strong><i>Juicy gameplay</i></strong> with strong screenshake, particles, flashes, and a crispy pixel art mostly done by me, but credits for bosses go to Shy<br>  </li><li> 23+ Achievements to keep your ventures validated</li></ul>",
