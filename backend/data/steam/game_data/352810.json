The story will proceed in a movie-like fashion.<br>We are proud to say the game is fully voiced (voiceover can be turned ON/OFF).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Message from the publisher</h2>Hi, I’m Hugo and I manage localization at Playism. I fell in love with YUKIE on my first playthrough and am thrilled to say the game is finally available in English!  <br> An Eternal Winter reigns over the land. Yukiji, a young warrior is determined to end this and avenge his forefathers by slaying the beautiful demon Yukie. A traditional fairytale that seems like it could have just popped out of Japanese folklore. <br>But what makes YUKIE stand out to me among narrative-based games is how well the sum of its parts – such as the art, musical score and writing – fit together so well as a whole, to create the captivating atmosphere of Yukie’s cursed yet beautiful winterland.<br>Apart from the text playing a major role in any story game, it was important for us to preserve the poetic phrasing and classic writing style of the tale. For this we enlisted the help of Timothy Borreson who took great care to keep the essence of the original Japanese text. He has worked on titles such as Brave Frontier, Armored Hunter Gunhound EX, Artifact Adventure and its upcoming sequel Artifact Adventure Gaiden.<br>On their path to revenge the player will encounter wolves, crows and legendary beasts that are hostile towards Yukiji and will have to fight their way out of these situations. To attack or defend, the key must be pressed the exact moment they hear the enemy approaching. Yukiji will also gain new powers along his journey, to help him in and out of the field.<br>Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy playing!",
