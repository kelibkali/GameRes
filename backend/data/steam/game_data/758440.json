In the past few weeks the waters have turned sour, the forests are dying; all due to a plague sweeping the land, in the form of an endless rose garden. <br><br>Two lost souls were chained together and sent to find the reason behind this corruption (or blessing). On your way you'll meet a group of very peculiar characters, strangely all connected to the plague and to each other. <br><br>It seems everyone really is chained up here, so to speak. Well, some more than others.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/758440/extras/15748c146d7323dbe76ad1f226b553e8.avif?t=1665508991\" width=600 height=74 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fast one-on-one battles with party member rotations.
