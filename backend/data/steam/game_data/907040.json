Its as simple as that, and thats how it was made. From the beginning our intention was to not offer any controller support to give every casual player a level playing field. Its also more fun for just a quick race, no need to spend time setting up any controllers!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Simple Rating</h2>Simple Rating is an individual player rank that goes from 0 to 99. Everyone starts on 45, but depending on whether you finish or not your races and drive cleanly this can rise and fall. Simple Rating is visible to all players in a lobby.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Developer and Future Updates</h2>As Simple Racing is a hobby project and therefore an indie game, updates will be small and irregular. However, there is already a plan to add wet weather races and different tyres! Dont be panicked though if it takes time because this is a side project I have been working on while in middle school.",
