    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >   Pathfinder RPG - Campaign Setting: Numeria, Land of Fallen Stars</h2>Ruins from the Stars<br>Thousands of years ago, a massive spaceship from a distant world broke apart in the atmosphere above Golarion, showering down alien debris and technological wonders--an event known as the &quot;Rain of Stars&quot;--onto the plains of Numeria. Largely kept within this land by the barbarian natives' superstition and hostility as well as the greed and jealousy of the magical cabal known as the Technic League, the technology from this advanced culture has defined Numeria over the centuries. Now, nomadic warriors and metal men clash in radioactive badlands, and treasure-seekers from across the Inner Sea flock to the strange metal dungeons that pepper the landscape. What mysteries of super-science await you in this magical land?<br><i>   Numeria, Land of Fallen Stars</i>   provides all the information a Game Master needs to run an adventure in the Pathfinder campaign setting's science-fantasy wasteland. Within this book, you'll find:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>An in-depth gazetteer of the four regions that make up Numeria, including detailed descriptions of its largest cities and its most dangerous and remote dungeons.<br></li><li>New rules for radiation, gravity fluctuations, deadly environmental hazards, extraterrestrial diseases, nanite infestations, and more--including the unpredictable results of drinking the alien seepage known as Numerian fluids.<br></li><li>Overviews of Numeria's most prominent Kellid tribes and the sinister Technic League.<br></li><li>More than a dozen new monsters and NPCs native to Numeria, including the mutant template and four new robots.</li></ul><i>   Numeria, Land of Fallen Stars</i>   is a must-have for GMs running the Iron Gods Adventure Path or anyone looking to introduce super-science into any fantasy campaign or setting.<br>Cover Art by J.P.
