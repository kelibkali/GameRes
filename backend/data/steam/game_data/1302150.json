Build your very own magical academy from the ground, hire the best and the worst teachers that the magical world has to offer. Manage disasters and celebrate your victories in this brand new enchanting tycoon game!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1302150/extras/a33875205d390530474b0fba3b9f4c8e.avif?t=1760820979\" width=600 height=237 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Build your school</h2>Create the magic school of your dreams! Use money and resources to create new rooms and hire staff, but be wary of trouble and irresponsible adults ruining your establishment. Solve the oddest mysteries and help your students achieve their best (or at least a pass) at school! <br>Build rooms and customise them to your heart’s content with just a few clicks in our creation tool! There are over 10 types of classrooms there to be created, but watch out for overcrowded classes and teachers lacking the skill to tame a hoard of students!<br>Do not worry! Every teacher and student will learn in due time! You can also pause your game and just hire a new banch of less incompetent ones! Or speed up the game and manage incoming disasters on the go! You (literally!) have all the time in this world!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1302150/extras/88a366041e9f314041a16503dadb25f0.avif?t=1760820979\" width=600 height=248 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Hire the staff</h2>There is a big variety of teachers you can hire in your brand new school. Their abilities, skills and teaching power will determine the fate of their students and the amount of… misadventures they might have during the class. But not to worry, with every lesson they learn something on their own and they come closer and closer to becoming the best teacher! <br>Not only the teachers are vital to life in the academy, you need crystal engineers who will manage and fix your power sources. There are also janitors who will take care of the mess after a failed alchemy lesson or a ghost roaming the school. <br>Your trusty staff will take care of the most unusual occurrences that may happen in your school and celebrate graduations of your students with the proper fanfare!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1302150/extras/e4ebbb920743e3172359bccffcd7b6a8.avif?t=1760820979\" width=600 height=227 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Meet your students</h2>Your students are not only the source of your pride, but also your income! The more students the more money, but can you manage that hoard of teenagers? <br>Every student has a different set of skills and dreams, so having a lot of classes will let them flourish! Your best students will become your pride and joy (and also a great source of school’s prestige)!<br>Let them study day and night, but do not forget to build dormitories so they can also have some rest, and enjoy watching their first attempts at wizardry! <br>Students are divided into classes by colour so it is easy to recognise where is which class and how are the students by the neatness of their uniforms.<br><br><strong>Let the magic guide you!</strong><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1302150/extras/977566b65ccd46cafea7f74338a71b84.avif?t=1760820979\" width=600 height=248 /></span>",
