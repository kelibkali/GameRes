    "description": "Intruder is a stealth multiplayer experience, inspired by the great single-player campaigns of Metal Gear Solid, SWAT 3, Deus Ex, and Splinter Cell. The goal is to bring aspects of these games into the gameplay of Intruder, and turn it into a team-based multiplayer shooter. Intruder allows for stealth, teamwork, tactics, and environmental interactions never seen before in a multiplayer game. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/518150/extras/c75217f8009da247c55ab11787b77e38.poster.avif?t=1732589204\" width=580 height=236 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/518150/extras/c75217f8009da247c55ab11787b77e38.webm?t=1732589204\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/518150/extras/c75217f8009da247c55ab11787b77e38.mp4?t=1732589204\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong><u>Team-Based Stealth Multiplayer</u></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Lure enemies into motion detectors near explosive traps.<br></li><li>Watch enemy movement through live security cameras and alert your teammates using the hand radio.<br></li><li>Use real SWAT hand signals to communicate silently when enemies are nearby.</li></ul>In Intruder, amazing stories and immersive gameplay come from the players’ actions to provide an experience you will never forget.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/518150/extras/ba56a7d57d6a68370ba6ece7b09afb37.poster.avif?t=1732589204\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/518150/extras/ba56a7d57d6a68370ba6ece7b09afb37.webm?t=1732589204\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/518150/extras/ba56a7d57d6a68370ba6ece7b09afb37.mp4?t=1732589204\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong><u>Immersive FPS Simulation</u></strong><br>Experience an immersive FPS simulation in Intruder with gameplay mechanics of climbing the environment, crawling through vents, and swimming through the waters.
