The player takes the role of mayor of the city. Soviet law and economy have their own laws. Every building influences a terror bar. Be careful, because excessive terror level leads to a rebellion. On the other hand, when terror level is too low, the dictator can replace you with a more appropriate person. Limited materials and people disobedience can cause trouble with implementation of five-year plans.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/432250/extras/5a4e4cf4c298657c114408f27964d33a.avif?t=1459542327\" width=648 height=124 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Every game is a little different.
