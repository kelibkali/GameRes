    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Mythic Monsters #15: Magical Beasts</strong></h2>The 15th volume in our Mythic Monsters series, Mythic Monsters: Magical Beasts brings you a dozen and one marvelous mutants and mutates of the magical world. From apex predators to bloodthirsty beasts, some crude and some all too cunning, some drawn from classical myths and legends and some part of the new invented legendarium of RPGs themselves, magical beasts are truly the monster's monsters!<br>Here you will find monsters steeped in the classics, like the fabled crocotta, leucrotta, and catoblepas of Ethiopia described by writers like Strabo and Pliny the Elder, to more broadly folkloric creatures like the basilisk or heraldic ones like the ypotryll . Some magical beasts were sprouted from fantasy literature, like the girallon of Burroughs or the peryton of Borges, but a great many magical beasts have sprung fully formed from the creative minds that have shaped the course of RPGs over the last four decades, from toy-inspired creatures like the infamous bulette that have been to the shapeshifting jackalwere, the roaring dragonne and the serpentiginous behir, from the mighty thrasfyr to the lowly but deadly stirge. This product also brings into view the warpwolf, a deadly rival to the friendly blink dog that shows just can happen when a creature jumps through the holes between worlds one too many times. As if these mythic beasts were not enough, Mythic Monsters: Magical Beasts also discusses the ecological and phenomenological role that magical beasts play in the campaign world, as well as bringing you 10 mythic feats that focus on the bloody and brutal nature of what a BEAST can really do. The 13 magical beasts contained herein, ranging in CR from 1 to 21, are updated for the mythic rules, and when we say updated we mean complete stat blocks, yes, but more than that every one of these massive menaces has its own unique and exciting new mythic abilities, from a mythic leucrotta's lethal bite and compelling lure to the loathsome stench and death gaze of a mythic catoblepas!<br>The Mythic Monsters series from Legendary Games brings you dynamic and exciting mechanics alongside evocative and cinematic new abilities that really help creatures live up to their flavor text, whether they are creatures of real-world myth and legend or creatures born out of the RPG tradition itself. These creatures can work just as well in a non-mythic campaign as they do in one that incorporates the full mythic rules, as you can throw them at your jaded players who think theyve seen it all or know the standard monster stats as well as you do. That look of surprise and What was THAT? will warm any GMs heart.<br><strong>Requirements:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included Pathfinder ruleset.<br><i>Conversion by:</i><strong> Jay Scheponik</strong><br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Jay Scheponik</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included Pathfinder RPG and D&amp;D 3.5/ OGL ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
