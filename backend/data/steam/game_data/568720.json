    "description": "Do you often think of what is there, beneath the towns and the cities we live in? Sewer systems, bombshelters, scientific objects... <br>Are you ready to find yourself in a place on the edge of the reality plane you are used to? <br><br>That day promised nothing bad. But a usual walk with a girlfriend ended up in runnung for ones lives from bandits, which lead the main characters into strange catacombs, where the usual laws of the universe fail. You will have to pass tough tests and to overcome yourself. <br><br>The Agony is a visual novel from the authors of &quot;Sixtieth Kilometer&quot;. <br><br>The plot movement depends on the player's decisions, each leading to its own consequences. <br><strong>There are four different endings, based on the choices you make in the first part of the game.</strong><br><br>The novelet genre gravitates toward pseudo-scifi rather than unexplicable misticism.",
