Tech, Heavy, Tiny and of course the formidable King Hung Ree embark on a journey home – but before they can set out, Tech first needs to escape from his Orc prison and then round up the rest of the group.

Along the way, they'll encounter all kinds of obstacles and puzzles that they'll only be able to overcome together.<br><br><strong><u>Tech:</u></strong> He is the nerd and genius of the group.
