    "description": "I always had a problem when people asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up; I never knew what to say. I would have said astronaut, but I knew that the food was awful. I eventually started saying ‘architect’, which led to a university course and a good grounding in many design skills, but my heart was never really in it. What I didn’t know then, and I didn’t realise until recently, was that the very thing I wanted to do to make a living didn’t even exist at the time. It might not even exist now. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is the story of the trainee wizard Slightly; how he came to be, how he almost disappeared forever, and how he returned after 25 years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWritten by Slightly's original creator, the book also showcases the artwork of Chris Graham. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSlightly Magic was a successful 90's computer game written by Colin Jones, author of Rock Star Ate My Hamster. Initially released on the ZX Spectrum, the game was published on a number of 8bit and 16bit formats.",
