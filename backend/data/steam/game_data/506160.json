    "description": "VR Fractals is a 3D Fractal Viewer for the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive. To use this you must have one of those headsets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is an experience similar to Oculus Dreamdeck, so expect about 5-20 minutes of gameplay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRight now there are 8 fractals. A code editor is included which will allow users to create their own fractals/shaders and share them with the community. More fractals might be added in later updates as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is a free demo available with one fractal and no editor that should give you a pretty good jist of what to expect.",
