The man smiles at her, warmth and kindess radiating from his eyes, as he hands her a flower.<br><br><strong><i>“You know... where I'm from, that flower there is usually given to people who leave on a journey, in a way to hope for prosperous new beginnings wherever they might find themselves.”</i></strong><br><br><strong>And just as life is filled with despair at times, it comes to show us it is also filled with incredible wonder, beauty and adventure.</strong><br><br>In a spur of the moment, our heroine decides to leave her old life behind and starts another one anew in a valley filled with flowers... where the sea, the sky and the earth all seem to meet.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1636680/extras/7dc752be0fde86f78f5e150e80e82531.avif?t=1695922854\" width=600 height=87 /></span><br><br>Check out our main character and four current romanceable bachelors, each inspired by a different season, below!

The choice is yours!<br></li><li> <strong>4(+) Different Romantic Routes:</strong> Each route features a unique and wholesome individual story, including NPCs and characters exclusive to each individual route.
