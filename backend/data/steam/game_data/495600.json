When you reach a certain amount of XP you are <strong>rewarded with a new item</strong>. Every item has its own values and modifiers - so even if you get the same item twice, it means it will have a different effect on your commander and furthermore, the item per se will be different!<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/495600/extras/74ad82b95ba0565874cb87c66b2bb933.avif?t=1586532707\" width=615 height=177 /></span><br>Mounted items will grant you special abilities. For example, the warp drive will allow you to warp quickly to another location.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/495600/extras/84d53101752b367cd843eb4504c99cdd.webp?t=1586532707\" width=616 height=33 /></span><br>All items vary in their own attributes (e.g. reload time, strength, range, ...) and also modify the attributes of other items through the four modifiers: <strong>attack, control, utility, and support.</strong> <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/495600/extras/05570da600a01a8705ad075edb92b699.avif?t=1586532707\" width=617 height=140 /></span><br>Furthermore, with the before mentioned modifiers the hull values are altered. So if you mounted items with good support values, for example, it means your hull's maximum health is increased and if you also mount the repair droid, it'll be able to restore more health.<br><br>With an increasing amount of items you obtained through playing the game, <strong>your possibilities will steadily increase</strong> and become a great way to outsmart your enemies by combining the right items.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/495600/extras/40de72b6a5cd8877d51fe5c6bd698e00.webp?t=1586532707\" width=616 height=32 /></span><br>Assemble your commander with the unique items you earned from previous battles. However, you can't mount all of your items on your commander's hull, so choose wisely!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/495600/extras/e9d1030ae8ef1fd7029e63067b590eb6.avif?t=1586532707\" width=616 height=631 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/495600/extras/79c1fd81589d5029eda61a3e4d1ae442.webp?t=1586532707\" width=616 height=30 /></span><br>There's also a different kind of XP: During a round of Asteroid Fight your team as a whole will earn <strong>XP for every kind of activity</strong> you do - be it fighting, healing, base building, ... When your team reaches a certain amount of this XP it will LEVEL UP as a whole, enabling everyone to choose an upgrade for one of its mounted items.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/495600/extras/c07c19c7ca0773530f14ad548883baa6.avif?t=1586532707\" width=616 height=273 /></span><br>So, if you decided to mount 3 attack items and 1 defense item, but during the battle there emerges the need for more defense, you can still specialize more on your defense by upgrading this particular item!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/495600/extras/8c4d0ce1db8f53eae7f5f87828921336.webp?t=1586532707\" width=616 height=30 /></span><br>Colonize asteroids and build up a strong economy that will support you and your team members with <strong>various specialized units</strong>.
