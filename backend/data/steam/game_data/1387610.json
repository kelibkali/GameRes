    "description": "<strong>Cowboys n' Stuff is a 2D, Top-down, wave-survival orientated game where you control and customise your cowboy in order to eliminate threats as they arrive; whether it is day or night...</strong><br><br>In Cowboys n' Stuff you are able to equip your cowboy with various items such as cosmetics and weapons in order to not only look the part, but also develop a weapon load out which suits your play style (Guns blazing, Close-Range Combat, and more!). Items can be acquired through the in-game shop and also by completing campaigns.<br><br><br>If your looking for a greater challenge though, be sure to check out endless mode. This mode will for sure challenge your strategy as the waves get progressively harder by both, enemy quantity and enemy variety. So i wish you the best!<br><br><br><br><strong>Cowboys n' Stuff works for both, Controller (Gamepad) and Keyboard + Mouse.</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1387610/extras/6879cd38c11b0ec005eddbbe16a25267.poster.avif?t=1729527862\" width=132 height=110 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1387610/extras/6879cd38c11b0ec005eddbbe16a25267.webm?t=1729527862\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1387610/extras/6879cd38c11b0ec005eddbbe16a25267.mp4?t=1729527862\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >--/ FUTURE PLANS for Cowboys n' Stuff \\-- </h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>More achievements to unlock<br></li><li>Steam leader boards which reset every month or so<br></li><li>Multiplayer support <br></li><li>More drops on the battlefield<br></li><li>Bosses!<br></li><li>More unique weapons bringing new mechanics to the game<br></li><li>More cosmetic options <br></li><li>Notification system which tells you what drop you have picked up recently<br></li><li>Game encyclopedia holding information about enemies and drops you encounter when playing the game.<br></li><li>Workshop support for changing textures?</li></ul>",
