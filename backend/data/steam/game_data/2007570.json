    "description": "<i>It's hard to be a human in a world of vampires, isn't it?</i><br><br>Knock the Bloody Door Down is a solo-developed narrative adventure game in which you explore an underground society of vampires. Walk, jump, and climb your way through a side-scrolling pixel art environment.<br><br><strong><u>NOTE</u>: The game was designed with 1920x1080 displays in mind. If you have the ability to set your display to 1920x1080, then doing so will result in the optimal gameplay experience.</strong><br><br><strong>Q &amp; A</strong><br><br>Q: Hmm, a side-scroller with vampires. So it's kind of like Castlevania?<br>A: Good question! No.<br><br>Q: Why is it free?<br>A: Because maybe the real treasure was the fishing minigames we played along the way.<br><br>Q: Is the game good?<br>A: No, but don't let that stop you from enjoying it!",
