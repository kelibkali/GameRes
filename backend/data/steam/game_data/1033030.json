Every sound you can hear was recorded in a real locomotive cab or on the train station. <strong>Physics are also very important</strong> - MaSzyna faithfully represents brake physics and traction characteristics of electric powertrains. Fictional maps are created in accordance with real world standards. MaSzyna also contains few accurately recreated real railways. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Simulation</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You can drive more than 40 types of electric and diesel locomotives, many electric multiple units and others. In addition the simulator contains hundreds of locomotives and carriages liveries, almost all created from real photos. Explore about ~15 railway routes (including one real Polish railway line Częstochowa - Ozimek) in almost 200 scenarios. Random events are used in many scenarios, ensuring that any mission is never the same. Traffic is controlled accordingly with realistic railway signalling. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You can drive express trains with a maximum speed of 160 km/h or regional trains with many stops. You can also choose a freight train: a heavy train with 40 cars of coal or fast intermodal container train. <strong>The choice is yours!</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1033030/extras/a615029e4fef9a70267f09652c45d211.avif?t=1769684706\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1033030/extras_big/a615029e4fef9a70267f09652c45d211.avif?t=1769684706 width=1560 height=820 /></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Don't give up early!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Accurate brake systems, electric traction simulation and realistic signalling: all of that makes MaSzyna one of the most realistic train simulators available.
