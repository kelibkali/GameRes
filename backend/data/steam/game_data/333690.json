Epanalepsis is a narrative-focused point and click adventure game that tells a story about those connections across sixty years and beyond that pays equal homage to New Wave science fiction, cyberpunk dystopian stories, and the art cinema of the early 1990s.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >FEATURES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Play as three characters in three radically different time periods.
