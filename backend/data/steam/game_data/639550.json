    "description": "The Path of Greatest Resistance now supports full-body tracking! For best results, use 3 Vive Trackers in addition to your controllers. You can also use just 2 Vive Trackers to only track your feet. Attach one tracker to the top of each shoe, and one on your back attached to your belt.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Jog-in-Place Locomotion using Feet Tracking</h2>Since it's release, The Path of Greatest Resistance has included a &quot;jog-in-place&quot; locomotion mode. In the standard version of the game, &quot;jogging&quot; is detected primarily by head motion. Now with foot tracking available, you can walk or jog forward in the game just by stepping up and down with your feet.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Don't like being active?</h2>If you don't feel like being that active, don't worry. You can still use the normal &quot;on-rails&quot; locomotion mode even with body tracking turned on.",
