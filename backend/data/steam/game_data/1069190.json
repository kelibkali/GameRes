    "description": "Flight of Nova is a simulator based on newtonian mechanics in which you control spacecraft in the Noren star system. You will fly multiple types of spacecraft doing transport and search missions in an environment with realistic aerodynamics and orbital physics.<br><br>Flight Of Nova features two gameplay modes:<br>1. Map Operations: contain series of missions taken from specific region or orbital station.<br>2. Rogue Mode: global missions based on messages we receive on the cockpit monitor FMS.<br><br><strong>Key Features:</strong><br><br>* Track IR support<br>* HOTAS support<br>* Realistic gravitation and orbital physics <br>* Atmospheric density inspired by earth data<br>* Aerodynamic drag corresponding to vessel shape <br>* Drag / air friction energy calculations<br>* Real-time accurate orbital data <br>* Orbital stations and docking system<br>* Planet surface outposts <br>* Real-time control over spacecraft<br>* Full-scale body diameter 12’700 km <br>* Search and transport missions <br>* Quick flight challenges",
