They Don't Sleep is a fast-paced, bite-sized zombie survival life sim with easy-to-grasp gameplay and no lengthy tutorials. Get right into the action and start shooting zombies, managing your supplies, and juggling the needs of Kaya and her child, all while trying to fix her truck and escape.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2009380/extras/f93c849140cff39c01094e3e0664f1e1.avif?t=1666109714\" width=600 height=64 /></span><br>The zombies never stop coming, but you have the ammunition to stop them--as long as you keep it stocked!  Keep them from breaking through your fences and fix them up when they get damaged.  But don't forget to take care of your baby and your own needs. Stress and hunger can be just as deadly as the ravening horde... to you or your child.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2009380/extras/03892523ca7b8147d452b33f197aff7c.poster.avif?t=1666109714\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2009380/extras/03892523ca7b8147d452b33f197aff7c.webm?t=1666109714\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2009380/extras/03892523ca7b8147d452b33f197aff7c.mp4?t=1666109714\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2009380/extras/3e45deb0c4168f8196f63a3d5d7ce2bd.poster.avif?t=1666109714\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2009380/extras/3e45deb0c4168f8196f63a3d5d7ce2bd.webm?t=1666109714\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2009380/extras/3e45deb0c4168f8196f63a3d5d7ce2bd.mp4?t=1666109714\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2009380/extras/b24849abb3a51f68bf4f2636abe4dc5f.avif?t=1666109714\" width=600 height=64 /></span><br>Upgrade seven different skills as you gain experience and level up.

It's a small game because it's made by one person, but it packs a punch.<br><br>My mission as a developer is to make small, engaging, meaningful games that you can jump right in and have a great time with and put back down when they're done.",
