    "description": "From the developer of Simple Farm comes a brand new relaxing survival game where you survive in a cabin set in a old school operating system.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI was watching a Kingsway stream one day, an RPG set in an old-school style operating system, when someone in the comments said that the UI was cozy. The comment immediately inspired me to make a coziness simulator based completely in an old-school desktop. Cozy Cabin is meant to be as relaxing as possible. It's set in a quiet, rainy town where your only job is to fish, farm, and mine in order to pay your monthly rent and stay in the cabin.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEarly Access Features:<br />\r\nFireplace That Dims The UI As It Dies Out<br />\r\nLofi Music Player<br />\r\nFishing<br />\r\nFish Breeding<br />\r\nFarming<br />\r\nGem Mining<br />\r\nFlipping Items At Competing Shops<br />\r\nFishing And Farming World Records To Beat",
