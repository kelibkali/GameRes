    "description": "Story<br />\r\nFifty years ago, the face of the Earth was permanently changed when it came into contact with a mysterious force known as the “Alpha Nebula.” As a result, humans developed various supernatural abilities and divided themselves based on those traits.<br />\r\nThe main factions include: The Tonitrui, the Excedente, the Praecantator, the Permuto, and the Northmanni. Each has their own unique set of abilities that came with the collision – with the exception of the Northmanni, who remain largely unchanged.<br />\r\nAmong these races, however, existed a special group of people who managed to retain all the other races’ abilities. They were a very powerful - but small and isolated group - known as “Emulators.”<br />\r\nArin Arlento was one of these people, living in a remote village with his grandfather and other members of their race; everything was peaceful until the Northmanni Empire massacred the Emulators and kidnapped his childhood friend, Aria.<br />\r\nThe only other survivor, Arin escaped into the Northmanni’s home continent of Rakos, hiding and plotting his revenge – that is, until he found out that Aria was still alive and was being experimented on.<br />\r\nLoathing the world that took everything away from him, Arin begins his quest to retrieve his friend and exact retribution on those who destroyed all that he held dear.<br />\r\nIt’s one misguided man against the world…<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout<br />\r\nBetrayed, defeated, and left alone in the cruel wilderness, the story follows our protagonist, Arin Arlento, and his quest for retribution; one that questions friendship, revenge, and human nature itself. Surrounded by a cast of quirky heroines, the story features a selection of scenes which range from slice of life to heart-breaking sadness to nail-biting action.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures<br />\r\nThe demo for the full visual novel, which is estimated at 5-10 hours of gameplay, covers the introduction sequence as well as introducing most of the main cast, story, and the setting for the game.",
