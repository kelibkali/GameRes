Corrupt the computer system you're infiltrating! Beware, this won't be easy, as you'll need to do an escape sequence to return to safety as it crumbles!<br><br><i>Red Trigger</i> was initially final student project made by Maxime Vézina, in Unreal Engine 4. It also won the prize of <i>Choice of the Industry</i> at ImagiNAD in May 2016, as well as <i>Best Indie Game 2016</i> from <i>Waiting4Players</i>. <br><br>Since then, Maxime gained experience in the Triple-A Industry and founded his own indie studio, Bold Spirit Game Studio. In 2023, this game has been remade from scratch in 2023 from a team of more than 15 people, and contains a ton of new features. It will be updated soon with this new content. The game lasts for about 40 minutes to 1 hour+, depending on the player.<br><br>The studio is also currently making the sequel, <i>Red Trigger 2</i>, which will be 10 times bigger than this game, much more complex and open. Interested? Make sure to wishlist it now!<br><br>",
