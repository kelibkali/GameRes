Moved by his heroism, she invites him to attend her all-girls' school for a year to help make her case that the school should go co-ed to resolve its funding issues. <br> <br>From there, your new life at Vincennes Private Girls' Academy begins. Over the next year you'll navigate interacting with the sheltered girls of the academy, the faculty who want to preserve the academy's strict traditions, and the cute heroines who have taken an interest in you. Will you prove that it's okay to shed some traditions and change with the times? Will you show the doubters that men can have friendly relations with women? Will you fall in love and find a true partner of your own? </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/344630/extras/685d118627ed8fb084e1c229b535a254.avif?t=1760653296\" width=780 height=346 /></span></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/344630/extras/33690abf71b8b809ec8d120069a86ed4.avif?t=1760653296\" width=780 height=280 /></span></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Fall in love with one of the four main heroines, and enjoy plenty of tender moments, adorable scenes, and charming interactions with them all!
