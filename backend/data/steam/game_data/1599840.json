    "description": "Original soundtrack for VR action-puzzle game Stacksquatch. Included are tracks for every season: Summer, Fall, Winter, and Hub. It's cozy like fresh cut grass, a pile of leaves, hot chocolate, or warm Hub rain. Straight from the game, perfect for looping all day long while you stack.",
