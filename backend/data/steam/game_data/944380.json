    "description": "Take on the &quot;control&quot; of our character. Put one foot in front of the other leg, and try not to fall.<br />\r\nThe goal of Drunk Puppet is very simple - go as far as you can. But, with long legs five times larger than the rest of the body, walking at all is not an easy task. Just just touch the screen to change your foot and watch Drunk Puppet go stumbling across the screen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDrunk Puppet is designed for players who like to perform difficult tasks and have fun. The game is unusually useful, and brings you a fabulous delight every time you go to a new record.",
