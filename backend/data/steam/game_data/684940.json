There are over 1,000 towns to complete.<br>Plenty of towns are easy enough. Some take complex planning. Do them in your own order. Get bonuses for completing regions and contracts.<br>Some cargoes are easy to get. Others you have to create in industries. Use existing industries and build your own.<br>The further you get from the start the more strategies you have to use.<br>Pimp up your trucks with bonuses. Last truck delivering gets the bonus.<br>The towns and map are to scale. Current or historical industry placement. You could even say that playing is educational.<br><br>There is plenty more to keep you on your toes.<br>Towns consume the cargoes you are trying to get to completion.<br>Big trucks are great for moving lots of stuff, but can't travel everywhere.<br>There are lots of broken roads that need deliveries.<br>Upgrade the industries for better exponential throughput.<br>Cargo stores can sure come in handy.<br>What! I can't take my big trucks across the water on a ferry.<br>... and what is with those quarantine checkpoints?<br><br>Complete towns, roads, industries, contracts, regions and states for lots of in-game and Steam achievements.<br><br>LOGistICAL's base game covers the whole of Australia including all the major cities, towns and industries.
