    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Located in the Brittany region, in the Morbihan department, the city of Saint-Servan has a population of 700,000 inhabitants and is set in a natural, maritime environment typical of the Breton ecosystem. The main city, Saint-Servan, is set in a more urban and rhythmic atmosphere worthy of France's major cities, with dense traffic, large residential and employment areas. The entire area is served by the Palme d'Or bus and tram network.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Sixteen lines of this major network are represented, linking the centre of Saint-Servan to the districts and villages to the north of the metropolis (such as Salérin, Monfort-sur-Rhé, Le Roc Saint-André, etc.), passing through historic districts, large residential areas built in the 1960s, eco-districts built in the 2000s, as well as hamlets, nature reserves, coastal roads and small Breton towns. The secret of this French ambience lies in the inspiration drawn from real places, but also in the creation of several hundred objects and splines that contribute to this impression.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Saint-Servan has a very different atmosphere to foreign maps, and is a new experience on OMSI 2. The map is fictitious on the whole, but many Breton locations (notably the Vannes conurbation in Brittany) have been faithfully reproduced.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Irisbus Citelis is available in four versions to meet the needs of all routes: the 12-metre version and the 18-metre version, both complying with Euro 5 or EEV standards. In addition to these two vehicles, the GC2 BRT and NGT have been added to the fleet, the most recent buses on the network.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >In this third version of the addon, discover the 4 new lines 14, 15, 17 and C24, as well as a new special service!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1457750/extras/1a793997ff716d4975eae772eaa367ae.avif?t=1764237280\" width=616 height=68 /></span></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >16 city and interurban lines</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Travel times up to 50 minutes/line</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Numerous typical French objects</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >High recognition value of the Breton environment</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Varied landscapes</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Contains Irisbus Cetelis in the 12 metre and 18 metre versions, as well as GC2 BRT and NGT</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Special French AI vehicles</p></li></ul>",
