    "description": "<i>The Cubedex of Brass and Wood</i> is a puzzle game concerning mysterious electromechanical devices linked by the Cubedex itself. Like puzzle hunts and escape rooms, sometimes the goal is obvious but the solution is challenging; and sometimes figuring out the goal is itself part of the puzzle.<br><br>More puzzles: additional variations of the <strong>Balance</strong>, <strong>Cart</strong>, and <strong>Machine</strong> puzzles are included (click the star in the upper left!) to further stretch your brain.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Devices</h2><br>The <strong>Balance</strong> has nine pans and eight weights:<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1300180/extras/7129793d927234d36b281e368c4182da.avif?t=1598932909\" width=323 height=250 /></span><br><br>The <strong>Cart </strong>is a Bakelite robot programmed with plug-in tubes:<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1300180/extras/ffd45ba7a080b921c2ba4a081d041c65.avif?t=1598932909\" width=315 height=250 /></span><br><br>The <strong>Machine</strong> has seven tubes and seven buttons:<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1300180/extras/34ccf7be98830db54961fbf354f477c5.avif?t=1598932909\" width=340 height=250 /></span><br><br>The <strong>Maze</strong> is a light puzzle.

The Steam releases are the first time these tiny and frustrating puzzling worlds have been available to a large audience, and contain significant enhancements relative to their original (single-member-audience) releases.<br><br><i>The Cubedex of Brass and Wood</i> is the first game in the main series of Cube* puzzle games. It was created as a midwinter gift in 2015 and updated and polished for Steam in 2020.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Standard Notes</h2><br>Nothing in these store pages, the game web page, the game documentation, or other materials outside the game is a puzzle.<br><br><i>The Cubedex of Brass and Wood</i> is intended to be solved without decompilation, resource snooping, or modification of game files. Indeed, these are all considered cheating. (And, really, who are you cheating but yourself? Once you know the answer, you can never discover it fairly.)<br><br>You will, however, benefit greatly from scrap paper, a good reference for standard encoding schemes, and -- potentially, though it is not required -- the ability to write some small computer programs to search for solutions to combinatorial problems.",
