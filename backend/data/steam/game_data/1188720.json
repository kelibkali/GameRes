THIS IS NOT A GOOD GAME ON ITS OWN</h2><br><br>Recently, this game was removed from <strong>Google Play Store</strong>. As a result, there is now barely any trace of it left on the internet. By releasing it on <strong>Steam</strong>, I'm hoping to fix that. It would also give some context to <strong>Drunken Wrestlers 2</strong>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Original Description:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Minimalistic ragdoll fighting game about drunken wrestlers, created in 7 days for NextCastle DevCup 2013 contest.<br></li><li>The goal is to force your opponent to lose balance, or inflict critical damage. The match goes to 5 wins.<br></li><li>This game has an option to play together on one device!<br></li><li>This game was made when I was 16.</li></ul>",
