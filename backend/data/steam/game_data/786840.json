Somehow all colors of your remote controlled car have been stolen by some nasty color-thief. Your mission is to grab the remote control and collect all tiles of a racetrack. <br>As a trophy you can win color sprays to bring back the color to your beloved rc car.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Drive your rc car</h2>With the remote control in your virtual hands you feel the 90s coming back. Drive our handcrafted indoor racetracks and win fantastic color sprays. You can play for yourself or challenge other players in multi-player mode.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Win color sprazs</h2>Your trophies are color sprays in different colors. With each race you have won you get one color spray. You can use the spray with your virtual hands and paint on your car.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Spray your car</h2>You can spray your car the way you like. Your customized car will be permanently saved in your room. Other players can see your customized car when playing with you. We might even host a beauty contest in the future.<br><br>There is only a limited number of color sprays you can win. To be precise we have 256.000 color sprays to win :)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Play together</h2>You can play the game together with other players. The player who collects more racetrack tailes will win the color spray trophy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Play basketball</h2>If you just want to hang around in a a nostalic room from your childhood and don't like challenges you can play basketball.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Listen to some 90s tune</h2>Of course you can always turn on the radio and listen to the 90s tunes.<br><br>It's a VR game for all who have seen enough shooters now wanting something to enjoy alone or with friends and other players.
