Experience a whole new level of combat with the Advanced Class Characters. <br> <br><strong>Item-Craft, Enchant &amp; Dissolve</strong><br>Items in Rakion can be crafted, enchanted or dissolved. Dissolving items you don’t use anymore is a way to obtain materials that can be used to craft other advanced items or to enchant them. Materials for crafting or enchanting items can be obtained by dissolving items or by clearing stages. <br> <br><strong>Attributes</strong><br>You can infuse your characters and creatures with the mighty attributes of water, fire and wind. <br>Learn and compare each element’s unique properties, as these Attributes can serve as an advantage or disadvantage. Choose wisely and balance your strengths and weaknesses to build the definitive character and creature combination with the power of the Attributes Stones.",
