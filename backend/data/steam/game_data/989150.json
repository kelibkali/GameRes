    "description": "Set in the distant future, Tales From Galaxy 34 is a narrative adventure game which follows a new recruit of the United Nations Space Academy after being unexpectedly &amp; suddenly promoted to a Captain and given command of an experimental ship. It soon becomes obvious there is more going on besides your superiors simply recognizing your talents.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you explore locations you'll find various encounters and challenges, giving you the opportunity to shape the story of this galaxy with your decisions. The further you travel from the Starbase the more unique the encounters and powerful the rewards.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEquip your ship and crew for the long voyages ahead. Collect as much data and encounters as possible before returning to the Starbase to cash-in the collected data. Use the collected money and promotions to improve your ship and go even further next time, all while unraveling the truth about why you were sent out here.",
