    "description": "This is a VR relaxation game, you are a passenger on a train that drives itself across endlessly procedurally generated environments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is low in interaction and mainly focused on letting you enjoying the ride as a passenger. I really wanted to make a VR experience where I could just relax and just completely tune out without having to think about much at all, and just enjoy the immersion. A bit like &quot;Slow TV&quot;.",
