    "description": "<i>“swifter than eagles, stronger than lions”</i> 2 Samuel 1:23<br><br>Smite your foes with bow and spear as you lead your mighty chariots to glorious victory. <strong>Swifter than Eagles</strong> extends Field of Glory II backwards to the dawn of “civilised” warfare, covering the <strong>period from 2500-681 BC</strong>. <br><br>The first civilisations in the Near East arose during the <strong>Early Bronze Age</strong>, 3500 to 2000 BC, in what is known as the Fertile Crescent, a vast semi-circular area of agricultural land stretching from Egypt to Mesopotamia. The most important of these were the many Sumerian city states, and the Old Kingdom of Egypt ruled by kings worshipped as living gods.<br><br><strong>The Middle Bronze Age</strong>, 2000 to 1600 BC, saw mass migrations of peoples into the Near East, which saw the rise of new states such as the Mitanni, Hittites, Babylon and Assyria. Northern Egypt was overrun by the Hyksos, who ruled as the 15th Dynasty. Chariots were developed in this period as truly effective battlefield weapons.<br><br><strong>Around 1550 BC</strong>, the Hyksos were expelled from Egypt and the New Kingdom period began. Under the New Kingdom Pharaohs, Egypt adopted a more aggressive foreign policy, and carved out a foreign empire in Canaan and Syria. This placed them in direct competition with the other great international powers of the Late Bronze Age, 1600 to 1200 BC, first Mitanni, then the Hittites.<br><br>Most of these great civilisations experienced a major crisis at the end of the 13th century BC; The Mycenaean and Hittite palace cultures collapsed, the Kassite Babylonian dynasty fell, the Egyptians abandoned their Asiatic empire, Ugarit and other Amorite city states were destroyed. The reasons for this crisis are not fully understood, but probably included drought and famine. Another possible factor was the migration of aggressive tribes into the region, including the enigmatic Sea Peoples.<br><br>After civilisations had recovered from the Late Bronze Age collapse, the Near East was dominated by the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which crushed all opposition with extreme brutality, eventually ruling over almost the entire Fertile Crescent during the 7th century BC. Meanwhile, Egypt went into a long period of decline, which saw her conquered by a succession of different foreign powers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Summary of features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>19 new factions<br></li><li>46 new units<br></li><li>66 new army lists<br></li><li>8 new Epic Battles<br></li><li>70 new Quick Battles<br></li><li>Expanded Custom Battles module.<br></li><li>Expanded Sandbox Campaign module.<br></li><li>4 new historically-based campaigns.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Details:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>19 new named factions: Amorite, Early Nomad, Gasgan, Hittite, Hyksos, Luwian, Makkan, Minoan, Mitanni, Mycenaean, Neo-Hittite/Aramaean, Nubian, Philistine, Sea Peoples, Sumerian/Akkadian, Syrian, Syro-Canaanite, Trojan, Zagros Highlanders.<br></li><li>46 new units: Picked Sumerian/Akkadian Spearmen, Sumerian/Akkadian Spearmen, Sumerian/Akkadian Spearmen with Pavise, Raw Sumerian/Akkadian Spearmen with Pavise, Sumerian/Akkadian Battle Cars, Early Chariots (Spear), Early Chariots (Bow), Egyptian-style Light Chariots, Egyptian Close Fighters, Egyptian Guard, Shardana Guard, Sherden Swordsmen, (Other) Sea Peoples Swordsmen, Picked Sherden Swordsmen, Picked (other) Sea Peoples Swordsmen, Philistine Spearmen, Philistine Guard, Libyan Foot, Libyan Swordsmen, Libyan Light Javelinmen, Nubian Close Fighters, Nubian Light Javelinmen, Nubian Light Archers, Anatolian-style Light Chariots, Anatolian-style Heavy Chariots, Anatolian Spearmen, Syrian Spearmen, Maryannu Light Chariots, Ugaritic Heavy Chariots, Minoan/Mycenaean Heavy Chariots, Minoan-style Spearmen, Aegean Light Chariots, Sea Peoples Light Chariots, Libyan Light chariots, Mycenaean-style Spearmen, Myrmidons, Early Middle-Eastern Close Fighters, Gasgan Warriors, Zagros Warriors, Neo-Hittite-style Spearmen, Early Assyrian-style Cavalry, Anatolian Irregular Foot, Anatolian Light Javelinmen, Early mixed bow and spear infantry, Raw early mixed bow and spear infantry, Early Levies.<br></li><li>66 new army lists (which expands the total number of army lists to 355).</li></ul>o\tAmorite 2000-1595 BC<br>o\tAssyrian 1365-891 BC<br>o\tAssyrian 890-746 BC<br>o\tAssyrian 745-705 BC<br>o\tAssyrian 704-682 BC<br>o\tBabylonian 1594-891 BC<br>o\tBabylonian 890-729 BC<br>o\tCypriot 800-681 BC<br>o\tEgyptian 2686-1551 BC<br>o\tEgyptian 1550-1451 BC<br>o\tEgyptian 1450-1277 BC<br>o\tEgyptian 1276-1201 BC<br>o\tEgyptian 1200-1150 BC<br>o\tEgyptian 1149-1069 BC<br>o\tEgyptian 1068-946 BC<br>o\tEgyptian 945-720 BC<br>o\tElamite 2500-2193 BC<br>o\tElamite 2192-1801 BC<br>o\tElamite 1800-1501 BC<br>o\tElamite 1500-816 BC<br>o\tGasgan 1450-1076 BC<br>o\tGreek 1179-681 BC<br>o\tGutian 2190-2115 BC<br>o\tHebrew 1000-801 BC<br>o\tHebrew 800-682 BC<br>o\tHittite 1680-1595 BC<br>o\tHittite 1594-1351 BC<br>o\tHittite 1350-1276 BC<br>o\tHittite 1275-1180 BC<br>o\tHyksos 1650-1591 BC<br>o\tHyksos 1590-1535 BC<br>o\tKushite Egyptian 732-728 BC<br>o\tLibyan 3000-1251 BC<br>o\tLibyan 1250-651 BC<br>o\tLibyan 650-550 BC<br>o\tLuwian 1680-1595 BC<br>o\tLuwian 1594-1180 BC<br>o\tMakkan 2500-1301 BC<br>o\tMakkan 1300-1001 BC<br>o\tMakkan 1000-891 BC<br>o\tMakkan 890-313 BC<br>o\tMannaean 1000-751 BC<br>o\tMinoan 1600-1450 BC<br>o\tMitanni 1594-1250 BC<br>o\tMycenaean 1600-1251 BC<br>o\tMycenaean 1250-1180 BC<br>o\tNeo-Hittite/Aramaean 1179-891 BC<br>o\tNeo-Hittite/Aramaean 890-700 BC<br>o\tNomad 2500-1001 BC<br>o\tNubian 3000-1281 BC<br>o\tPhilistine 1166-801 BC<br>o\tPhilistine 800-600 BC<br>o\tPhoenician 1099-801 BC<br>o\tPhoenician 800-682 BC<br>o\tSea Peoples 1208-1176 BC<br>o\tSherden 1278-1209 BC<br>o\tSumerian/Akkadian 2500-2193 BC<br>o\tSumerian/Akkadian 2192-1762 BC<br>o\tSyrian 2500-2200 BC<br>o\tSyro-Canaanite 1594-1276 BC<br>o\tSyro-Canaanite 1275-1208 BC<br>o\tSyro-Canaanite 1207-1100 BC<br>o\tTrojan 1250-1180 BC<br>o\tUrartian 870-781 BC<br>o\tUrartian 780-750 BC<br>o\tZagros Highlanders 2500-1001 BC<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>8 new Epic Battles: Kerkha River 2272 BC (Akkadians vs Elamites), Megiddo 1457 BC (Egyptians vs Syro-Cannanites), Zippasla 1410 BC (Hittites vs Mycenaean Greeks), Kadesh 1274 BC (Egyptians vs Hittites), Fields of Perire 1208 BC (Egyptians vs Libyans and Sea Peoples), Ilion 1184 BC (Mycenaean Greeks vs Trojans), Qarqar 853 BC (Assyrians vs Aramaeans, Hebrews and others), Per-Peg 730 BC (Kushite Egyptians vs Libyan Egyptians).<br></li><li>70 new Quick Battles (almost all playable from either side).<br></li><li>Expanded Field of Glory II Custom Battles module now includes all 355 army lists from Immortal Fire, Rise of Rome, Legions Triumphant, Age of Belisarius, Rise of Persia, Wolves at the Gate and Swifter than Eagles.
