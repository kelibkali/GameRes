    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Dawn Of The Millenium </i>- the year is <strong>2001</strong>. You're a novice librarian tasked with keeping things running smoothly and closing up shop for the night. Sort out the shelves, maintain the utilities of the library and take calls as they come in - but keep your ears to the ground; there's something sinister unfurling in Maple Falls County.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Logic-oriented puzzles and mechanics make up most of this game with a fully integrated physics and object-grabbing system, drawing inspiration from horror games of the past and present.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\">The game takes roughly 30-60 minutes to finish depending on your own individual pace. It features multiple paths the player can take, and even has a secret easter egg. <i>Think you can find it? </i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\">Highly recommended for playing in the dark - the muted orange hue of the library coupled with the dark atmosphere should be very easy on the eyes. An ideal game for those seeking a cozy indie horror experience. Also, headphones are a big must if you enjoy immersive 3D sound design.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4303010/extras/536f8e3fc42084533461246b24f9704a.avif?t=1770234597\" width=106 height=116 /></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" style=\"text-align: center\">Disclaimer Regarding AI Usage</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>This game does not feature any AI content.
