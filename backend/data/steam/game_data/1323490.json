    "description": "In this cooperative horror game, players are tasked with guiding a lost soul through the trials of purgatory. Players must work together to navigate a series of dark and unsettling halls, using their knowledge and intuition to overcome the terrifying obstacle that stands in their way. As they progress, they will uncover the truth behind the soul's death and the secrets of the afterlife. Can the group successfully guide the soul to redemption and escape purgatory themselves, or will they fall victim to the tortured spirit that haunts the halls?<br><br>Join forces with a group of friends to increase your chances of success as you navigate the trials of purgatory. Utilize an adaptive difficulty system that adjusts to the number of players and make strategic decisions on whether to split up or stay together to overcome obstacles.<br>Every moment will require decisions to be made as you race against the clock.<br><br>Choose your gear wisely as you venture through the halls. Each player can only carry one item at a time, so plan accordingly. Will you stay together and let your friend carry the torch? Or will you both find your way in the dark? The choice is yours.<br><br>Death is not the end. If you die, you will gain a crucial supporting role to ensure your friends success. Guide them through worldly interaction.
