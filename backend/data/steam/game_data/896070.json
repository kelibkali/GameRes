    "description": "<strong>The main character finds himself in the waiting room, in the complex Hazardous Course - the place where deadly experiments are conducted. During the tests, he realizes that he is not the first to be here, and, probably, not the last. On the way the main character will come across not only enemies and obstacles that can kill him, but also various puzzles that have to be solved to continue the path.</strong><br><br><strong>Second Hazardous Course</strong> is a hardcore platformer with elements of action. Bypassing various obstacles, such as pits with acid, or simply falling stones, you have to go to the end and finish all these tests. In the game there is also a cooperative, which supports the game on one server up to 4 players.",
