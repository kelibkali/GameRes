    "description": "This package includes:<br />\r\n20 tracks from the soundtrack for the game (320 kbps .MP3, .WAV)<br />\r\n1 bonus track which may or may not include horse farts (.MP3, .WAV)<br />\r\n1 wallpaper for your computer<br />\r\n1 vintage stereogram from ca. 1993<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat the composer?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSune Kølster is a Copenhagen based music composer, with a master degree in symphonic filmscoring, a background in hardcore punk, and an obsession with middle-eastern music - not your typical game-audio-designer. He has been working with Triband since their very first game KEYBOARD SPORTS, and was a part of the WHAT THE GOLF? team from the very beginning. The score was developed concurrently with the development of the game, where the red thread through all the levels was the quirky and edgy sing-a-long-barbershop feeling, with the composer's voice as the main musical drive.",
