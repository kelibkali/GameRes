It all started with an unfortunate accident in the middle of the Nevada desert. They warped off the road to shorten the route to camping. Unfortunately, their car broke down on the way. They were waiting a long time for any help and then decided to take life into their own hands. Since then, they have been stuck with each other and put to test of survival in extreme conditions. A very hard task awaited Will, who would not only take care of himself but also of his disabled father.  <br><br><strong>Crafting </strong><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1444540/extras/3f933fb01890867efa710c00224603db.poster.avif?t=1667551010\" width=600 height=150 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1444540/extras/3f933fb01890867efa710c00224603db.webm?t=1667551010\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1444540/extras/3f933fb01890867efa710c00224603db.mp4?t=1667551010\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>You have to be observant in order to survive to protect yourself and your dad. Any kind of food and access to drinkable water is priceless. In the game, you will have to look for solutions and create new objects to store resources. During extremely cold nights, you will have to make a fire that will keep you warm. Only in this way you can be in good shape to continue your journey. During hot afternoons, you will have to search for cacti that contain water and try to store them in pre-prepared containers. <br><br><br><strong>Caring for father </strong><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1444540/extras/2d1c1f8450aa0e67e8cd6dc94dcc947b.poster.avif?t=1667551010\" width=600 height=150 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1444540/extras/2d1c1f8450aa0e67e8cd6dc94dcc947b.webm?t=1667551010\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1444540/extras/2d1c1f8450aa0e67e8cd6dc94dcc947b.mp4?t=1667551010\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>You must take care of your dad’s physical and mental condition throughout the whole journey.
