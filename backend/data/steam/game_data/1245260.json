    "description": "Battle for Iwo Jima simulates the Invasion and desperate fighting for the island from Feb 19th, 1945 to March 26th, 1945. You take command of the US Marines and will test your ability to do better than those brave Marines did back in 1945.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1245260/extras/c7b4ac9fb192566deb05cee45c1358d9.avif?t=1590015939\" width=600 height=240 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Realistic battle depiction</h2><br>Each turn in the game represents one day with each day broken into phases.

You will need to exercise Command and Control over your units by keeping them in range of their HQ to retain their effectiveness in battle. Armor should be used in a supporting role and not in the front lines otherwise the Japanese will eat them for breakfast. Troops need to rest and not be constantly engaged in combat.
