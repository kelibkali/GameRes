    "description": "<strong>The city is your orchestra, you are the conductor, how should this rhapsody play?</strong><br><br><i>Welcome to City Rhapsody! Instead of layers and layers of bureaucracy; we, the citizens, decided to appoint one person, you, as the city's &quot;conductor.&quot;<br>Look out! We are very needy so it just may get chaotic. From everyday traffic congestion, changing power demand, accommodating our requests, and providing uninterrupted city services; to fighting out-of-control fires that threaten to wipe us out. Are you ready to take up the challenge?</i><br><br>City Rhapsody! is a low-poly, chill, sophisticated, and engaging city-building game with a twist of real-time strategy mechanics. The player plays the city's all-seeing &quot;conductor&quot; who gets to build all roads and buildings, tweak traffic configurations, open/close businesses, manage complex utility infrastructure, and command special city units. Use them creatively to solve citizens' problems.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2061030/extras/1f3885a59e1a2156f933fd6774adc71c.poster.avif?t=1665523999\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2061030/extras/1f3885a59e1a2156f933fd6774adc71c.webm?t=1665523999\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2061030/extras/1f3885a59e1a2156f933fd6774adc71c.mp4?t=1665523999\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>⛰️<strong>With a fully procedurally generated, dynamic, and evolving world, choose the ideal location to start building your dream city.</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 3 map sizes, 128x128, 256x256, and 512x512 with realistic tree-growth simulation.<br></li><li> Gain more citizens to build larger construction projects.<br></li><li> Modern, hand-crafted, low-poly style building models and structures.<br></li><li> A unique hybrid grid system that neatly stacks your buildings and roads while not sacrificing variabilities.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2061030/extras/e4f7aee0ed9fa35b1f267a77fc340f17.poster.avif?t=1665523999\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2061030/extras/e4f7aee0ed9fa35b1f267a77fc340f17.webm?t=1665523999\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2061030/extras/e4f7aee0ed9fa35b1f267a77fc340f17.mp4?t=1665523999\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>🛠️<strong>Control buildings and fine-tune the city's operations to make sure your city has enough money to grow.</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Realistic utility simulation.<br></li><li> Full data visualization maps that help you manage your city.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2061030/extras/dcf510d8415700cebe1e7348adb484d4.poster.avif?t=1665523999\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2061030/extras/dcf510d8415700cebe1e7348adb484d4.webm?t=1665523999\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2061030/extras/dcf510d8415700cebe1e7348adb484d4.mp4?t=1665523999\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>😉<strong>Use everything at your disposal creatively to solve challenges and make citizens happy.
