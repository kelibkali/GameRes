Project Winter is an 8-person multiplayer game of survival and social deception, where cooperation is essential, but betrayal is inevitable. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Stranded in the frozen wilderness, survivors must gather resources, repair objectives, and fight the elements to escape. But hidden among them are traitors working together to sabotage, mislead, and eliminate their so-called allies. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Project Winter 2.0: Cabin Fever introduces a faster, more streamlined experience that keeps the paranoia and chaos alive while making it easier than ever for new players to jump in. For seasoned players, the punishing Classic mode remains - demanding coordination, grit, and sharp instincts to survive. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >No two matches are ever the same.
