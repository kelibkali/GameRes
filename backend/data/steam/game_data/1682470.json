One that might tip the scales against the endless horde. This new factor is you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >In Nymar Arisen, you take the role of an avatar of the creator. You have been sent to defend the world of Nymar from an endless army of demons who have destroyed the world multiple times before. To aid you in your task, the creator has given you control of the native antmen. On your command, they can automate many things such as resource gathering.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >FEATURES:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Riftgates-These structures will allow more powerful monsters to spawn in your world. They are harder to fight, but give better loot when defeated. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Antmen-The natives of Nymar can be recruited and commanded to aid you. From the Harvester who autonomously gathers items to the Mages who can craft any item you give them with enough resources to the Knights who will defend you from monsters, they are yours to command. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Creative Power-As an avatar of a god, you have access to magic in the form of Creative Power. You get it from crafting items, and can condense it into Creative Cores used for recipes like the Wild Riftgate and the Control Staff.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p>",
