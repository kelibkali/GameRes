    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Album Corvus is a game made by one person. </strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This game is my variation of a premium PC game based on an astounding Buriedbornes Android game. I adore Buriedbornes and wanted to create something very similar yet not free-to-play. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >It’s a roguelike dungeon crawler featuring permadeath, strong progression between runs, decisions that truly matter, perks that change the way you play, and one-on-one turn-based battles. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Album Corvus is set up in a gritty dark fantasy setting.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Your goal is to descent the deadly procedurally generated dungeons filled with traps, ancient labs, treasures, and monsters. Reach the latest floor to defeat the evil that lurks beneath and grab the precious loot it guards. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>New experience each run</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Each run will play differently thanks to the procedural generation of loot and the dungeon itself. Think carefully about where to go next because dungeon rooms will provide different conditions that can drastically affect the outcome of a battle. Sometimes rooms will appear with closed doors so you won’t be able to see what’s inside until you step there. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Augments</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Items you find affect the way you play. Not only they provide numeric bonuses to your HP, Shield, and stats. They also come with Augments that could change your tactics completely or reinforce your current build. For example, a perk could grant you automatic use of another skill when you attack, or add a retaliation, or give you a mostly impenetrable barrier that completely neglects all incoming damage… then disappears. Or give you a Shield boost when you get a Barrier. Possibilities for character building are deep in this game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Progression between runs</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >During your adventures in the Dungeon, you’ll find different resources that you can use to tinker with your characters and reinforce them. Add permanent Augments (aka perks), improve the starting skills, unlock and choose a Signature skill - all to be able to delve deeper.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Decisions matter</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Album Corvus is a game about making weighted decisions and facing their outcome. You’ll have to think and decide practically anywhere in the game, be it a decision about keeping your current weapon or swapping it with a new one; grabbing an artifact or rerolling it for a possibly better one but with a risk of breaking it completely; stepping into a room with another Adventurer and an Event for great loot or choosing an easier fight with less significant reward.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You’ll be making decisions between runs as well: what Augment to buy; what character to upgrade; what is better for your Fencer - retaliation or more frequent events; what signature skill to use, etc. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Deep character building</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Possibilities for build creation are vivid in Album Corvus. Each character plays differently by default, has its strengths and weaknesses. But you’ll be able to tailor it to your taste by choosing proper Signature skills, selecting what skills to level up, what perks to add, what items to use. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Strong replayability</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >There are 7 character classes to play, about 30 monsters plus other Adventurers delving the Dungeon, 5 bosses with strong skills, dozens of skills and perks, about 15 room modifiers. Procedural generation of the Dungeon and loot, of some enemies, overall progression in this game is built to ensure strong replayability. Don’t expect to be able to win the game during your first runs.</p>",
