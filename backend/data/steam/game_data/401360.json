    "description": "<strong><i>The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human</i> is a pixelated, side-scrolling, underwater action-adventure game about exploring the decaying ruins of our species -- and fighting deadly sea-creatures -- in search of answers about our downfall.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Melancholic underwater atmosphere:</strong> We really wanted to show the beauty of the sea as well as our influence on nature.<br></li><li><strong>Exploratory storytelling:</strong> The story is mainly told through the art and backgrounds with some textual hints along the way.<br></li><li><strong>Unique conflict encounters:</strong> Throughout the adventure, you will encounter -- much like Odysseus in <i>The Odyssey</i> -- monstrous beasts and challenges that you will have to best.<br></li><li><strong>Polarized gameplay:</strong> It's pretty chill until you've gotta fight for your life!</li></ul><br>We think it's important to bring up global issues that have affected our lives and try to give a different point of view: climate change, terrorism, and technological progress.<br><br>We’re not lying: You <i>are</i> the last human; humanity is doomed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Backstory</h2>The water rose by an unpredictable amount due to climate change. The Earth's surface froze over, and humans were forced to live underwater -- where they could still harvest energy and grow food -- changing how cities and districts looked. As resources began to dwindle in the year 2971, sub-aquatic spaceships were sent to a nearby wormhole to look for habitable planets. Things did not go as planned. And now the ship, Argo9, has returned thousands of years later in a time after humans have gone extinct.<br><br>It's up to you to determine whether the ruins of our species is a travesty or an inevitable conclusion as you explore the lush aquatic world and encounter deadly underwater monsters.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human || Digital DELUXE Edition </h2>This edition includes a pixel art map with all the boss locations, the full soundtrack composed by Karl Flodin -- and a digital booklet that gives some extra information about the story, weapons, and upgrades. Lastly, you'll receive a few desktop backgrounds that we made. All of this will be found in the game's folder. <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/401360/extras/d11704cdd37546acf22e1721dd884b7d.avif?t=1726781161\" width=630 height=324 /></span>",
