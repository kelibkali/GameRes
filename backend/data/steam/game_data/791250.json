    "description": "The demo will will allow you to catch four fish and play four levels. The fish will get harder to catch showing off how the game progression and mechanics work.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFishing on the Fly is an indie hard core fly fishing game created by one crazy person, Mac Clark, a fly fishing guide in the Northwest. This is one of the only fishing games made in the U.S.A., so expect a game where the dev actually fished these areas with expert knowledge. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnjoy explosive fishing game play, explore actual models of blue-ribbon rivers, catch authentic trophy fish and experience true to life fishing challenges. Original and unique game mechanics get more challenging the longer you play. Built using the award winning Unreal Engine.",
