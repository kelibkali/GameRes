    "description": "The <strong>Mentoes Corporation</strong> is plotting something, and whatever it is, it can't be good. Looks like <strong>Pop Pixie</strong>'s mission to infiltrate the <strong>Mentoes Tower</strong> will have to go ahead sooner than planned. It's time for him to load up his weapon and polish his skills in <strong>Amanda</strong>'s jury-rigged <strong>Mission Training</strong> simulation. The only problem: He's already failed the simulation 172 times, and time is running out.<br><br>This demo is a short prequel to the main game. It guides you through the game's main mechanics, such as fighting enemies, rolling through obstacles, and searching for clues to bring the <strong>Mentoes Corporation</strong>'s dark secrets to light. There are five short levels, including a boss fight against a holographic simulation of <strong>Mr Mentoe</strong> himself.",
