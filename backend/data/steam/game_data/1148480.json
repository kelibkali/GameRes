You can fly forward, back first or in any other way. Ship's engines work to ACCELERATE it, but not to keep it's speed constant. None the less controls are designed for maximal player's comfort -- your ship is equipped with multiple automatic stabilizing systems, which can be configured to suit your needs;<br>- You should be extreamly cautious with your property: it's not always possible to restore your ship, if it crashes, and cargo in it's hold can become easy game for pirates;<br>- Game world constantly changes: apart from 15 static sectors you can explore distant space travelling through wormholes;<br>- Game space is saturated with various events: from random quests sent to your ship's computer from nearby station to an old half-destroyed ship you can stumble across in a far sector.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1148480/extras/f4426eb22d15b58e9efed508659bee1b.poster.avif?t=1767111215\" width=626 height=444 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1148480/extras/f4426eb22d15b58e9efed508659bee1b.webm?t=1767111215\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1148480/extras/f4426eb22d15b58e9efed508659bee1b.mp4?t=1767111215\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
