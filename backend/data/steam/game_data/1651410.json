    "description": "The last Time Knight is looking for Time Spheres, technology that allows the user to travel through space and time. The Time Spheres got lost during the great Calamity, the same catastrophe that destroyed the planet of the Time Knights. Should the Time Spheres fall into the wrong hands, the results could be catastrophic. One can only imagine what a madman could do with a device that can travel through space and time. Or a politician.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1651410/extras/cee7758f881fe612e7309fdd6966fbf3.avif?t=1750429966\" width=600 height=150 /></span><br><br>Time Knight Adventures is a retro platformer - a single screen adventure game featuring non-linear stages to explore.
