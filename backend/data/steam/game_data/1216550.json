    "description": "Only a few more seconds, then it starts. The players are standing in the players' tunnel, very close to the field, but they hardly notice the deafening noise of the fans. It is the most important game in the club's history and the pressure is enormous. Will they fail? Or will they make history today? It's in your hands!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1216550/extras/86e5068bc94cfabad607d4b578c63525.avif?t=1675104128\" width=616 height=205 /></span><br><br>In <strong>Player's Eleven</strong> you take over a football club of your choice or start a whole new career as an aspiring football manager. In the process, you put together the team, fine-tune the tactics and ensure optimal training. New talents join your squad through scouting and youth players. You constantly develop the stadium and the club grounds.<br><br>But watch out: The president keeps a close eye on your sporting and financial development. Don't disappoint his expectations!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >FIND THE RIGHT TACTIC</h2><br>Strengthen your squad with players who fit your tactics. Do you prefer to play with man-to-man defence or without? Short passing or long balls forward? With the right players and the right tactics, you can lead your club to success.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1216550/extras/df322ca85a00b0fea97031f333d33251.avif?t=1675104128\" width=600 height=150 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >DEVELOP THE CLUB</h2><br>Youth academy, scouting department, training grounds or the medical department: expand your club grounds to get the best out of your club.
