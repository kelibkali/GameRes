    "description": "<u><strong>-SYNOPSIS-</strong></u><br><br>The sun is gone, your world has been plunged into perpetual night by the god Asteros. You come to your senses in the middle of a battle to access the abyss. Access the abyss and thwart Asteros' plans so that daylight is restored.<br><br>You play as a group of adventurers made up of atypical characters with varying abilities.<br>Make your group grow over the meetings in order to increase your possibilities through overpowered united attacks.<br><br><br><br>                                                                                            <strong> <u>                    - THE COMBAT MECANICS -</u></strong><br><br><strong><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Elements </h2></u></strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2005220/extras/5be2dfffa1faea1b4e1f5baf833591e2.avif?t=1664573472\" width=550 height=546 /></span><br><br><u><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >-Elemental effects- </h2></strong></u><br><br>Some elemental effects include burning, sacred burning, wet or frozen, all elemental effects that can help you in combat or, on the contrary, handicap you.<br>In the system of elemental effects set up, the elements and the counter-elements cancel each other out.<br>For example, if an enemy has a burning effect active, playing a water or ice spell on them will cancel that state and replace it with a wet or frozen state.<br><br><br><strong><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Team Customization</h2></u></strong><br><br>Go on an adventure with a team of up to 6 characters simultaneously, giving you great possibilities for synergies and united attacks in combat.<br>All additional members will be part of a party you have access to outside of combat.<br>Having trouble defeating a boss? Remember to change the composition of your active team!<br><br><br><strong><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Skill combinations</h2></u></strong><br><br>Skill combinations are based on the skills used by certain characters during their turns, allowing them to cast a different but more powerful skill than the one originally chosen if the right conditions are met.<br>For example, if a character uses a tornado and another fire, the skill will become a fire tornado.<br><br><br><strong><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Synchronized attacks</h2></u></strong><br><br>With the right characters on the team, attacks uniting the strength of 2 or more characters become possible, causing devastating effects. These attacks represent the affinities between the characters, find them all!<br><br><strong><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The fury skill</h2></u></strong><br><br>Gain rage points with each hit received, when an ally falls in battle or under other special conditions! When a character reaches 100 rage points, they enter a state of fury, this can also happen directly when an ally falls in battle. The state of fury causes several effects including that of unlocking special skills focused on extreme offensive power at the expense of defense. During the Early Access phase, characters will benefit from a physical transformation representing an evil version of themselves during the Fury phase.<br><br><strong><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Soulforce skills</h2></u></strong><br><br>Fill your soulforce bar as you fight! Soulforce-type skills allow you to harness the power of a character's soul to produce an ultimate attack. Each character has several soul force skills that can provide a powerful protection skill or produce damage to enemy soul points as well as various effects to defeat otherwise unbeatable powerful opponents<br>ex: a dragon has 100,000 HP but 100 soul points it will be easier to defeat it by reducing its soul points to 0 rather than aiming for HP. <br><br><br><br> <strong>     <u> - THE CHARACTER BUILDING -</u></strong><br><br><strong><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The archetype</h2></u></strong><br><br>Each character has its own archetype influencing the stats obtained after each level up. These stats are automatic and cannot be changed, accentuating the character's core mechanics without major impact if you decide to customize your character outside of their core mechanics.<br><br><strong><strong><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Elemental nature and skill tree</h2></u></strong></strong><br><br>Each character has their own elemental nature, influencing the very nature of their abilities and the choices available in their skill tree. For example, a Water nature character will be more of a support character, while a Fire character will be an offensive character. Note, however, that although some characters have the same elemental nature as others, their skill trees and how they are played are still unique.<br><br><strong><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Distribution of Stat Point</h2></u></strong><br><br>And finally there are the special statistics which particularly influence the fight like the precision, the dodge, the counter, the chances of making a critical hit. Each point will change the statistics little but allows you once again to direct your characters according to your desires..<br><br><strong><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Weapons, armor and accessories</h2></u></strong><br><br>Each character will have a weapon type that only they can equip with variants to boost either the character's base mechanic or another that you choose.<br>Regarding the armor, it will be divided into three categories: light, medium and heavy, offering specific bonuses for each of these categories (more defense at the expense of the shield, more shield but little pv, etc.)<br>Any character can equip any armor and this in order to be able to embody the character of your dreams, who has never dreamed of playing a tank mage? <br><br><br><br>                                                                                        <strong>                        <u>        - EXPLORATION -</u></strong><br><br><br><strong><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The World</h2></u></strong><br><br>Explore a vast continent in a semi-open world consisting of two main parts: The human world and the abyss.<br>While the human world will be an opportunity to do pure exploration and complete some secondary objectives or go in search of other companions, the abyss will be where most of the main story takes place, which will not prevent you from finding fellow travelers!<br>Each of these two worlds is planned to be 20km2.<br><br><br><strong><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Multiple choice situation</h2></u></strong><br><br>Who hasn't dreamed of having an RPG where your decisions really matter? Here your decisions really matter and will impact the course of your adventure and the way others perceive you in a more or less significant way depending on your choices, it could even allow you to access a city or businesses normally closed to access !<br><br><br><strong><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The secret Passages</h2></u></strong><br><br>Some passages will be blocked or hidden and only certain characters will allow the passage. For example, a rock obstructs the passage, the iron fist skill would destroy it to be able to pass.<br><br><strong><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The dongeon</h2></u></strong><br><br>Dungeons are spread all over the continent like so many other explorable places that range from ruins to dungeons or even hidden villages or magical forests. <br><br><br>                                                                                     <strong>          <u> - THE CHARACTERS -</u></strong><br><br><br>There will be 15 characters in the game, some will be recruitable over the course of the adventure, others will have to be found and/or meet conditions for them to agree to join you.
