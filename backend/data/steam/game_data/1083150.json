Hanged, burned and killed in battles against navies of Spain, France, and the United States. Colonial powers began to control the water and ravage the lands without any regards to people and their history. The true free world and the pirates almost vanished. The last few insignificant islands are waiting to be smashed by the unstoppable colonial foot.<br><br>But what would happen if SOMEONE would unite them? If a legendary captain would arise once again? Can the free world be saved and the history was rewritten? <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1083150/extras/da5b42105d2cf112c3d8d551317b6d2d.avif?t=1726695616\" width=616 height=347 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >SAIL THE MOST FRIGHTENING SHIP IN CORSAIR HISTORY</h2><br>Directly control your ship.

Or maybe you want to save the resources for building or next days? You decide.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >REBUILD THE DEFENCES</h2><br>After winning back some land you can decide to spend resources on defensive structures or to push forward and invest in the fleet. Structures stay with you forever. Fleet helps only during the current day.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >UPGRADE YOUR SHIPS AND STRUCTURES ALONG THE CAMPAIGN</h2><br>No matter what style of gameplay you fancy there is always something to upgrade or improve for the next battles.
