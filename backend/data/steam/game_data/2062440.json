    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Pilot an aging, unreliable spacecraft around the asteroid Ceres, in this realistic space flight simulator. Featuring extremely detailed systems modelling, simply surviving a flight will require detailed knowledge of your spacecraft, its systems and the emergency procedures. Switches, buttons, levers, checklists, procedures, and with full VR and HOTAS/HOSAS support guarantee a hands-on interactive cockpit experience like no other.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Features • Detailed flight dynamics – Pilot the most accurately modeled spaceship out there. Trajectories must be estimated and refined by the pilot; no magic numbers or automatic guidance are provided. Every maneuver requires attention and careful adjustment. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Thrusters and propulsion – Engines and thrusters produce slightly varying forces, with minor instabilities, shifting center of gravity, fuel slosh, off-axis thrusts, and uneven output, making handling a precise, and skillful challenge.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Extensive spacecraft systems – Power, life support, communications, propulsion, and avionics all interact realistically, degrade over time, and can fail unexpectedly. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Advanced radio simulation – Every antenna, transmitter, and receiver is modeled with physical accuracy. Signals vary with orientation, distance, terrain, and interference.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Traffic control – Receive guidance and clearances from traffic control, while struggling with signal delays, dropouts, and intermittent transmissions. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Cabin and life support systems – The breathable air in the cabin, including N2, O2 and CO2 levels, is fully simulated, including multiple pressurized tanks, valves, regulators, relief vents and suit loop simulation - and the consequences, should the mix go wrong.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Thermal and power management – Heat generation, dissipation, and energy distribution all influence performance and survival.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Aging systems and malfunctions – Components degrade with time and use; valves freeze and stick, battery voltages sag, gasses leak, and failures occur unpredictably. Survival depends on problem-solving, and knowing the systems and backup procedures.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Environmental and orbital modeling – Detailed orbital mechanics subtly affect flight, adding challenge to navigation and landings.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >VR – Designed and built for an unparalleled VR experience from the ground up. Also supports flatscreen play.</p></li></ul>",
