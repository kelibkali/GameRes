    "description": "Shuzzler is a category-based trivia word game with cards drawn from a deck that determine criteria for word submissions. This alternative format adds new layers of strategy and fun not seen in other word games.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Game Play:</strong></h2>Like many word games, Shuzzler involves spelling words from available letter tiles in a grid, but there is a twist: cards drawn from a deck determine specific criteria for valid words that can be used in word submissions. For example, a given card may require spelling words with exactly four letters, words that start with the letters &quot;SH-&quot;, or words for types of fruit, US states, or sports. The objective is to earn cards by spelling the allotted number of words specified for each card. For untimed levels, it is also an objective to clear certain letter tiles marked with a star icon or lock and key icons (more info below).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Key Features:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Single-player and local PvP multiplayer or play against an AI opponent<br></li><li> 67 levels available in single-player mode, including 32 fast-paced, timed levels and 35 untimed levels (NEW!)<br></li><li> 350+ unique cards and 125 category cards (e.g. colors, beverages, mammals, automobiles, etc.) featuring beautiful concept artwork<br></li><li> Submit words using letter tiles in a grid by selecting tiles individually or swiping (i.e. click-and-dragging to connect adjacent tiles). Swiping earns 1-bonus point per letter tile!<br></li><li> 1, 2, and 3 card draw (see Multiple Card Draw explanation below)<br></li><li> Special tiles including gems, lock and key tiles, starred tiles and tiles with point modifiers (explained below)</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Multiple Card Draw:</strong></h2>The multiple card draw mechanic functions similarly to the way cards are drawn from the deck in a game of Solitaire. Either 2 or 3 cards are drawn at a time and are revealed in a stacked configuration (see graphic below). The top-most card must be earned before the underlying cards can be earned.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1458370/extras/9eea9d4e40af57080955d98cd07d2816.poster.avif?t=1703148257\" width=610 height=126 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1458370/extras/9eea9d4e40af57080955d98cd07d2816.webm?t=1703148257\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1458370/extras/9eea9d4e40af57080955d98cd07d2816.mp4?t=1703148257\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Gem Tiles:</strong></h2>Gem tiles award points if all of the letter tiles beneath them are cleared to bring the gems down to the bottom of the tile grid. In <i>Solo Play</i> levels, at least one gem must be earned as a condition for winning the level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Lock And Key Letter Tiles:</strong></h2>The newest untimed level content features lock letter tiles and key letter tiles marked with lock or key icons in upper left of the letter tiles. If a lock or key letter tile is used in a word submission, the corresponding lock or key tile of the same color must also be used in the same word for the word submission to be valid. As an additional condition for beating untimed levels, all of the lock and key tiles must be cleared to win.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1458370/extras/locksKeysStarsAndGems_Screenshot_ZoomedIn.PNG?t=1703148257\" /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Game Modes:</strong></h2>The main content of the game can be found in <i>Solo Play</i>. However, the game also includes a <i>Pass And Play</i> mode that enables local multiplayer games for playing with friends and <i>Versus AI</i> mode that allows you to play against an AI opponent. More details are provided below:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><u>Solo Play:</u></h2> Solo Play (i.e. single-player) offers 67 individually-crafted levels divided between two different variants of the game: <i>Timed</i> and <i>Untimed/Casual</i>. As the name suggests, the <i>Timed</i> games are fast-paced and require earning all (or most) of the cards before the timer runs out. Whereas, the <i>Casual</i> levels lack a game timer, but require clearing all letter tiles marked with star icons (and possibly lock and key icons) as an additional winning condition.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ></h2>All of the levels are organized into 9 distinct categories: Food, Animal, Geography, English, Science, Home &amp; Living, Culture, Society, and Miscellaneous.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><u>Versus AI:</u></h2> Play a custom PVE game against an AI opponent with two different custom difficulty settings. <h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><u>Pass and Play:</u></h2> Play against a friend locally or remotely on the same device. Customizable game play options include time limit, card-draw (number of cards revealed from deck per draw), and gem tile inclusion.</ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Additional Features:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> In-game dictionary definitions<br></li><li> Partial keyboard support<br></li><li> Post-game stats</li></ul>",
