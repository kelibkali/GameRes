    "description": "You have been hired to fix anything that breaks at the popular children's arcade &quot;Dinobag's Arcade&quot;. Each night you are given a list of things to fix, and it is your job to fix them... and then escape the monsters that haunt the arcade. Each night you receive a note with a list of things to fix, and then you must move around the arcade fixing those things while evading the arcade's 5 mascots to try to escape with your life for 6 nights straight. Armed with nothing but a flashlight and the tools to fix the electronics that break, you're in for a tough night, and a life of reoccurring nightmares, or no life at all.",
