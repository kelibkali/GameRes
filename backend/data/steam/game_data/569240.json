    "description": "Ripley's Believe it or Not!® (2004): This is possibly the most complex table to come from legendary pinball designer Pat Lawlor (who also created Funhouse and Addams Family). It allows players to travel with Robert Ripley across seven continents to discover the strange, the bizarre, and the unusual! The goal was to make a pinball machine that appeals to the casual player as well as the expert, which is accomplished through a special feature aptly entitled \\'Believe it or Not.\\' This multi-level rule enables the beginning player to achieve some of the game's goals early on and earn frequent multi-ball modes, while allowing the more advanced player to extend their opportunities through better play.",
