    "description": "“Fit It” is a virtual reality game where you have to fit through holes in walls that are moving towards you. Move in your game area and create shapes with your body as accurate as possible to the hole in the wall to earn as much points as you can. The more precise is the shape that you made the more points you will get. <br>Compete with your friends in local leaderboard or step in competition with other players around the world in “infinite” mode leaderboard.<br>“Fit It” has several games modes:<br>○ CLASSIC<br>Limited number of differently cut out walls that you have to fit through.<br>3 difficulty modes: easy, medium, hard.<br>○ INFINITE<br>Same as classic mode but with infinite number of walls! If you are up for a challenge choose this mode.<br>○ MATH<br>Test your calculation knowledge, solve math equation and choose hole in the wall with a right answer. According to the chosen level you will have to add, subtract, multiply, or even find the “X” value.<br>3 difficulty modes: easy, medium, hard.<br><br>IMPORTANT! <br>&quot;Fit It&quot; can be played with or without HTC vive trackers. To get better immersion and full body movement it is advisable to use 2 or 3 HTC Vive trackers (Attach two trackers to your feet and one additional to your waist). <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/951450/extras/ad9541fc12e03d0eb349ccddb9382a8a.poster.avif?t=1548161010\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/951450/extras/ad9541fc12e03d0eb349ccddb9382a8a.webm?t=1548161010\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/951450/extras/ad9541fc12e03d0eb349ccddb9382a8a.mp4?t=1548161010\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>New update is now live (UPDATE 1.4)<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/951450/extras/a205971d1fcdc87a67e6ee22cba26365.avif?t=1548161010\" width=616 height=352 /></span><br><br>What's new:<br><br>- New outdoor map<br>- Huge walls update (over 70 new walls added)<br>- Updated Math mode<br>- Fixed full body calibration<br>- Now you can make your character invisible for MR or other purposes.<br>- Few minor bugs fixed<br>- Graphical update<br><br>UPCOMING UPDATES<br>○ More walls for each mode<br>○ Different gameplay modes <br>○ The additional game area with new walls<br>○ More characters<br>○ Multi-player mode<br>○ Game community walls workshop<br><br>We are a small developer group (3 people and doge) and it is really important to reach you all.
