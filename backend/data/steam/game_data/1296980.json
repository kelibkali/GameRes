In order to pay the bills, he needs to think up a story and apply for a grant - the deadline is today - a lazy Sunday in the middle of summer.<br><br>On this Sunday, his struggle is disturbed by an invitation to attend an unavoidable family obligation - the place Sid grew up in is about to be sold, and his mother wants him to come home for a small party so he can say goodbye to it. With the deadline approaching and his creative juices having frozen, this is not something he's looking forward to.<br><br>Talk to old friends, run through the fields, swim in the ocean, and solve relaxing puzzles in this warm, slice-of-life narrative about nostalgia and the passage of time by the developer that brought you Rainswept. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1296980/extras/ca413c065bebfc9fdedcaaa0fc3d364a.poster.avif?t=1746610328\" width=512 height=286 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1296980/extras/ca413c065bebfc9fdedcaaa0fc3d364a.webm?t=1746610328\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1296980/extras/ca413c065bebfc9fdedcaaa0fc3d364a.mp4?t=1746610328\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> A warm, slice-of-life narrative about nostalgia, appreciating the present, and the passage of time by the developer that brought you Rainswept.<br><br></li><li> Take part in Sid's creative process as you play through a parallel story set in a fantasy world - right out of the book that Sid is attempting to write.<br><br></li><li> Simple, relaxing puzzles that keep gameplay interesting without slowing down the story.<br><br></li><li> A friendly and supportive cast of characters with deep histories and fleshed-out personalities.<br><br></li><li> Cinematic presentation accompanied by a beautiful soundtrack by micAmic (Rainswept, The Cat Lady, Lorelai, Downfall)<br><br></li><li> An atmospheric, warm, and cozy world to lose yourself in as you get immersed in Sid's journey back home.</li></ul>",
