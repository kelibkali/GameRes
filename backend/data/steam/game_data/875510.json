    "description": "Midnight Awake is a horror adventure game. The story begins when a boy wakes up at the middle of the night and faces with some mysterious events. His dad is missing and what should he do with the strange phone call? Let’s find out what happened to him and his family. Help him get through the emotional night and choose the right ending for him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis 3D game allows you to explore the scene while standing still but you can only step on its guide. You have to resolve many puzzles. Although sometimes it doesn’t seem to make sense, but you will eventually get it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game persuades you to find out what happened to the boy’s life rather than frighten you with a disgusting creature. However, it is still thrilling to beware of something you don’t know.",
