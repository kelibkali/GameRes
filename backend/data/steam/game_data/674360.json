    "description": "Orb Flo is a puzzle game comprised of a set of prisms and receptacles.  A puzzle is considered solved whenever the orbs flow through all receptacles.  Flow can be altered by toggling a prism on or off.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game has three different modes: practice, time-trial, and endurance.  In time-trial mode, you are ranked based on how quickly you solve ten puzzles.  In endurance mode, you are ranked by how many puzzles you can solve using a set number of lives.  A life is deducted if you use up too many moves to solve a puzzle.",
