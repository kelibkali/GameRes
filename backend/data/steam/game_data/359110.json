    "description": "It’s been two years since Atcchan, our protagonist, left his hometown; a small, sleepy village with a tiny population. Now he is finally able to return - but only for three days. How will his old friends react to him, and will their relationships be able to stand the test of time?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor a person who’s always been afraid of change, this is a worrying prospect for our hero… but it’s something he will have to overcome if he can ever hope to right his past wrongs. And a failure to do so can result in some rather unpleasant outcomes...",
