    "description": "Funanigans includes 8 different multiplayer party games! Launch the game, create a room, share the screen, and anyone can join and play from a phone, tablet, computer - anything with a web browser that supports WebAssembly!<br><br>Your device with a browser is your controller:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Draw! Switch colors and line thickness. Undo, redo, and clear. In some games, someone else will also be drawing on the same canvas!<br></li><li> In some games, you have limited ink for drawing or can only draw a limited number of lines.<br></li><li> View information that other players can't see.<br></li><li> Enter text or numbers, make choices from dropdowns, or check boxes.<br></li><li> Fast reload button - if your screen seems out of date, refreshes faster than the browser reload button.<br></li><li> Automatically rejoins if you refresh the page - no need to re-enter the room code or your name!<br></li><li> Autosave! Each time you draw a line or modify an input, your response is saved. If you need to refresh the page or time runs out, your saved inputs are retained!</li></ul><br>All the games include customizable options, such as how many rounds to play and how much time players get to provide input!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1386330/extras/52044680a7fc53aae6237a97a5a0f721.webp?t=1601269693\" width=142 height=43 /></span><br>In <strong>Phonanigans (4+ players)</strong>, alternate between writing text and making drawings - like Telephone with pictures.
