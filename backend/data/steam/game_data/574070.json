    "description": "Space Wars: Interstellar Empires is a turn-based tactical strategy game where you side with a powerful galactic faction, each with its own fleet and play style, and gain access to hundreds of distinct space crafts. <br><br>Choose a starting ship and set off on a sprawling map filled with distinct locales, tactical advantage points and enemy worlds. Conquer galactic territories through combat, complete missions, and use the experience gained to upgrade your crew and ship or acquire more spacecraft.<br><br>Fight alongside your faction to claim every system in the galaxy, one planet at a time. Work with allies to forge new friendships and clans, or go rogue and discover worlds on your own. Either path will lead to tense battles for enemy space … or to defend your own.<br>Once an invading force conquers a region, that faction’s map is updated to include the area. Each race must take the war to their enemies and overpower other species to win total control of the universe.<br><br><strong>FEATURES</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Explore a massive intergalactic map made up of multiple regions. <br></li><li>Enjoy stunning high-quality graphics with intricately-detailed and distinct ships. <br></li><li>Currently Playable Factions: Sol Imperial Worlds and Genari United Empires<br></li><li>Choose from more than 100+ spaceships.<br></li><li>Participate in a universe where hundreds of battles may be going on at once <br></li><li>Manage the captain and crew of your ships with dedicated skill trees.<br></li><li>Strategize your moves in turn-based combat and revel in immersive tactical mechanics</li></ul><br><strong>FACTIONS</strong><br>The <strong>Sol Imperial Worlds</strong> represent the human race; they have sturdy, well-balanced utilitarian warships with a focus on plasma weaponry and strong force fields. Their technological advantage also excels in propulsion, as the Sol’s ion drive technology surpasses the Genari’s fusion drives. Their officers focus on defensive skills.<br><br>The <strong>Genari United Empire</strong> are falling behind in the technological race, but have more maneuverable ships with advanced armor. They also have marine pods, which offset their disadvantage by boarding onto enemy ships and either causing crew casualties or capturing the ship outright. Their officers focus on offensive skills.<br> <br>The <strong>Ma’Alaketh Confederation</strong> wield technology that is centuries ahead compared to Sol and Genari. Little is known about them other than their minimal interest in the conflict between the warring races. They have more distinct long-ranged weaponry and dampening fields that make them harder to hit. Their officers focus on technology-based skills.<br> <br>The <strong>Hive</strong> are sentient creatures that live and die in space.  Starting as spores, they use absorbed energy from solar radiation and organic matter captured from enemy ships to grow into larger forms. Their weaponized nature stems from a need for self defense, causing them to produce lethal defense mechanisms that develop as they advance. They have no crew but improve through growth and absorption of defeated races.",
