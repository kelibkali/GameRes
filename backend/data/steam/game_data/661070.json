    "description": "The great world-ship Perigee is powered through deep space by the matter its generating core collects. As captain of the utility ship Compass Needle, shoot matter onto the playing field with the aim of grouping the greatest number of like colors to create energy and score points.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are special matter types that can change the direction that matter orbits the playing field in, jump matter to other orbits, or destroy all matter in close range.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeep matter out of the center of the playing field! If too much matter collides with the Compass Needle, it will cause a chain reaction that destroys Perigee and ends the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures a colorblind mode for players who have one or more of the three forms of colorblindness!",
