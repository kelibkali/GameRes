    "description": "Starr Mazer: DSP is a side-scrolling shoot’em up in the same vein as classics like Gradius and Lords of Thunder with a roguelike twist on the traditional lives/continues system. Players take control of a squadron of DSP pilots with different ships, weapon loadouts and voices. Your mission is to battle through nine frantic arcade levels, countless waves of enemies, 3 powerful bosses, and take down the G’ell Super Ship in a single run. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/462100/extras/6bf86f5a59e35f2ac7abadb8aeda482f.avif?t=1564963090\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><br>The citizens of Thersa-CPIX are at war and we’re not sending one hero to the fight, we’re sending EVERYONE!<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/462100/extras/a80765bdc77a05b402b8fe1361a2ce37.avif?t=1564963090\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Levels - Battle through nine Levels, across three intense arcade-style bullet-filled acts!
