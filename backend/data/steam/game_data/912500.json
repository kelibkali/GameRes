    "description": "<strong>Poltergeist Treasure is an absurdist comedy point &amp; click adventure game set in the strange (and often silly) magical land of Artovya, but actually just in a forest.<br><br>As the brave knight Sir Typhil of Creulor continues his quest to bring a unicorn to the castle and be crowned king, he finds himself trapped in a haunted forest by a malevolent ghost.</strong><br><br>As with all of the games in the series, Poltergeist Treasure is mainly a point &amp; click adventure, but with elements of other types of games present as well. In this episode, a section of the game is a top-down stealth game.<br><br>As stated immediately above, this is a point &amp; click adventure game and thus contains the standard compliment of point &amp; click adventure game features including:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Walking around from place to place by pointing <i>and</i> clicking!<br></li><li>Talking to NPC's by choosing dialog options and receiving witty responses!<br></li><li>Picking up everything that isn't nailed down and putting it in your inventory!<br></li><li>Using your inventory items on objects or people in the world in order to solve puzzles!<br></li><li>Using your inventory items on other inventory items in order to solve puzzles!<br></li><li>Using your inventory items on absolutely everything you see because you're stuck on this puzzle and can't figure out what to do!<br></li><li>Literally slapping yourself in the face because that puzzle solution was so obvious and yet it took you 20 minutes to figure it out!</li></ul><br>Also, as already stated, a portion of the game is a top-down stealth game, and as such contains the following features:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Walk around and avoid obstacles, some of which are moving!<br></li><li>um... yeah... that's pretty much all the features of a top-down stealth game.</li></ul><br>While a stand-alone game in its own right, this game continues the over-arching story from Unicorn Dungeon:<br><br><br>Also see the sequels:<br><br><br>",
