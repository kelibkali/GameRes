I'm Melon, a Pico Dragon from the absolutely hip new party game, &quot;Dragon Drop&quot;!<br>I don't know who you are, or how I got here, or where &quot;here&quot; is for that matter (I'm VERY scared), but since you're here, let me tell you a little bit about Dragon Drop!<br><br>In Dragon Drop, you'll play as a Pico Dragon (like me!) and use our breath-defying PICO BEAMS to wipe rows of cubes off a checkerboard stage! With the right skill and timing, you can knock your rivals off the map and become a Dragon Drop champion!<br><br>Here are some of the features you can look forward to when Dragon Drop releases on Steam!<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Play with up to four players or bots for the best in block-dropping mayhem, across dozens of unique stages!<br></li><li>Customize your own Pico Dragon with a huge variety of hats and colors! (I don't know how many, but it's less than 100 billion)<br></li><li>Clear achievement boards to unlock new customizations, stages, songs, and other rewards! New boards will be added over time!<br></li><li>Rest easy with the knowledge that you've downloaded dragons to your computer!</li></ul><br>We hope to see you drop in soon! And remember: I'm still trapped here! Tell the devs to let me out!!",
