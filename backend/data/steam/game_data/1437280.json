It offers many elements taken from classic survival experiences and roots it in an engaging story-driven campaign that can be played solo or with friends. <br><br>Traverse the barren ruins of Paris, loot for items to help you survive, and be sure to exercise extreme caution. A survivor equipped with a backpack, flashlight, and some little items in between. With only a few sparse supplies, and your wits, do you think you can survive the apocalypse?<br><br><strong>Your Journey Begins When You Find the End of the Railway</strong><br><br>On one fine afternoon, just as when the sun was about to set, several unprecedented events occurred in the city. You got caught in a train crash, and fell unconscious for several hours. When you wake up, you slowly discover that the whole city of Paris is in total chaos.<br> <br>The military quickly responds by locking down the city, bringing aid to the population, and conducting investigations. They found that some of the survivors were exhibiting strange behavior and began referring to them as “assimilated”. <br><br>Start your journey to escape the city, ally with fellow survivors, defeat all the threats of the “Assimilated”, and find out the cause of these calamities.<br><br><strong>Shh… Stay Quiet in the Subway</strong><br><br>The centers of many cities on the planet have become the scene of deadly confrontations between mankind and assimilated. As the battle rages, the city of Paris will gradually lockdown due to quarantine, and the only living things that will remain are survivors, assimilated, and military forces.<br><br>With Paris in quarantine, and the streets overrun with assimilated, the best place to make your escape are the subways where the assimilated are fewer. Experience the multitude of emotions that come with navigating the subterranean tunnels.<br><br>Loot, crawl, climb, run, tiptoe… But whatever you do, do it quietly.<br><br><strong>Game Modes:</strong><br><br>- Campaign: multiple-hour, story-driven campaign. <br>- Coop: Up to 4 players can survive together at the same time<br>- Arcade: mini-campaigns, and a wave-based mode on exclusive maps<br>- Map Editor: create, share, and play custom maps for infinite replayability<br><br>",
