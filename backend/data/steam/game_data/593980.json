    "description": "<strong>Gather resources, expand your ship, raise a strong crew, build defense systems and protect your people.</strong><br><br>It all happened in the year 2821. That's when everything changed. Before that, they were just a distant wonder. A miraculously odd telescope reading or a blip in the noise.<br><br>But as we were watching them... They were also watching us. And when they came for us, we all watched them together. I mean, all of us. The whole planet. They appeared above us, destroyed our defenses. And we knew we were doomed.<br><br>We left us with no other choice! We had to abandon Earth. Our last transport ship, 'the Trabalt,' was our only hope. But was this small, salvaged vessel enough to get us off Earth? To take us out into the unwelcoming galaxy? To find new footholds for the human race?<br><br>They may have taken our world. But we still have our wits. And our ingenuity. And our will to fight!<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/593980/extras/180f55c4b24506564f9e2ca53124183e.webp?t=1494226536\" width=635 height=30 /></span><br><br>Gluon is a combat, survival and exploration game with space battles featuring massive numbers of ships.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Gather resources!</strong><br>Your journey is full of dangers.
