    "description": "Keylogger is a visual novel about identity theft in a future where losing your information means certain death.<br><br>Follow the story of Alsace Morose, a man who was put into insurmountable debt when he was a young boy, and his crew of identity thieves, or &quot;keyloggers,&quot; who travel throughout the Continuum in their rocket, the “S.S. Hummingbird,” searching for identities to steal.<br><br>The crew of the S.S. Hummingbird is: Quaternine, a normal-looking man who is actually part Temnospondic; Cruce, a fundamentalist Christian whose viewpoints are antiquated in the futuristic Continuum; Akhtempo, a 6’11” New Egyptian who lost his keylog during the RTE; and Galacia, Morose’s girlfriend from Crystallica, who is entirely made of crystal.<br><br>The only way they can make ends meet is by selling people out of existence.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Synopsis:</h2><br>Each person’s family name in the Continuum is given a debt which they must pay back, or they risk being wiped by the Grid. The family debt was instituted to prevent the bankruptcy of the Continuum, which had too much owed to them by the citizens. Once a member of the Continuum turns 16, their debt repayment plan is put into effect.<br><br>The keylogs fetch a large price, and can be used to sell the “potential,” so to speak, of each living person, if the keylog can be acquired. That’s where keyloggers come into play. Keyloggers are identity thieves, whose one goal is to obtain keylogs. The main goal of keyloggers is to “dox” and attain the keylogs of people so they can sell them out of existence.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1497770/extras/6bd367a1639af17d321936ea5006b05b.poster.avif?t=1698351587\" width=774 height=250 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1497770/extras/6bd367a1639af17d321936ea5006b05b.webm?t=1698351587\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1497770/extras/6bd367a1639af17d321936ea5006b05b.mp4?t=1698351587\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Keylogger is a kinetic sci-fi visual novel spanning 83 chapters, with an additional 88 footnotes for deeper explanation.",
