The Ishimura was a Planetcracker-class starship besieged by grotesque reanimations of its dead crew, known as “Necromorphs.”<br><br>After unearthing a strange artifact known as the Marker, Isaac finds himself on the Sprawl, a giant space station in orbit around Saturn. Unable to remember how he got here and plagued with demented visions of his dead girlfriend Nicole, he must survive another nightmarish outbreak of Necromorphs as he fights his way towards an answer he hopes will end all the chaos.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/47780/extras/25f327121fe84cee6ecc18110db8998f.avif?t=1766432381\" width=666 height=196 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Tear through space with full 360 degree movement.<br></li><li>Wield a set of devastating tools to bring the terror to space.
