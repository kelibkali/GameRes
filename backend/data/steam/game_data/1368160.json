When disaster strikes and you're forced from your homeland, you must use your wits and every tool at your disposal to survive and dominate. Implacable monsters and ruthless rival mages stand in your way. Can you bring Muriet under your spell? <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368160/extras/8155775a06f11bc42649da8ee31142f9.avif?t=1770320441\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368160/extras_big/8155775a06f11bc42649da8ee31142f9.webp?t=1770320441 width=1560 height=312 /></span>How your faction develops is in your hands. Select from six pre-defined mage archetypes, or fully customize your own mage, choosing their traits, starting spells, and initial unlocked research. Over 60 diverse spells are at your disposal from four magic Realms: Nature, Fire, Water and Arcane. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >But the configuration possibilities don't end with your mage. With a vast research tree featuring over 300 options, your experience will differ hugely depending on which research paths you specialise in. Want to focus first on becoming an all-powerful mage, bursting with powerful spells? No problem. Or do you think quickly developing military might is key? Go ahead. The choice is yours.<br><br>  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368160/extras/9c15f021a4ade7842573a52cf5dbf77c.poster.avif?t=1770320441\" aria-label=\"Your Faction Your Choice\" width=1170 height=664 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368160/extras/9c15f021a4ade7842573a52cf5dbf77c.webm?t=1770320441\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368160/extras/9c15f021a4ade7842573a52cf5dbf77c.mp4?t=1770320441\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368160/extras/04b2c8ddbc5113fce07316b79bda0361.avif?t=1770320441\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368160/extras_big/04b2c8ddbc5113fce07316b79bda0361.webp?t=1770320441 width=1560 height=312 /></span>As picturesque as Muriet is, it's filled with dangers. Predators lurk in dark forests, Undead soldiers and terrifying monsters emerge from rifts between worlds, and rival mages have also staked their claim on this verdant land. You will need to fight if you are to survive and thrive.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >In addition to your mage's powerful spells, you can command dozens of units to defend your provinces and conquer new ones. Send them to fight automatically with just a couple of clicks and adjust battle stances to give yourself the best chance in each encounter.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Before expanding into unconquered provinces, make use of Heart of Muriet's unique exploration and spying features. Send scouts to assess a province's attributes and the enemy's strengths and weaknesses so that you can plan your next moves accordingly.

Dwarves, elves, humans and other mythical creatures are at your command, hoping that you'll lead them to prosperity. Craft bespoke settlements using dozens of upgradeable buildings, from imposing watchtowers to bustling marketplaces, quaint wells to mysterious laboratories.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Expansion and the exploitation of resources, however, come at a cost. You must consider your population's happiness, ensuring they feel protected and enjoy living in a harmonious settlement, or discontent will grow. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >And, just like your settlement, Muriet is ever-changing. Random events can alter the world's dynamic, such as unearthing new resources and threatening vital forests. What's more, the world will react to your actions. Unleash a fireball, and you better have workers and water at hand to douse the flames, or your province will turn to ash.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368160/extras/15dd78cdaefce6bc9283d70707844afa.poster.avif?t=1770320441\" width=1170 height=664 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368160/extras/15dd78cdaefce6bc9283d70707844afa.webm?t=1770320441\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368160/extras/15dd78cdaefce6bc9283d70707844afa.mp4?t=1770320441\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368160/extras/1232125c99c17d649685c872d1ce90a8.avif?t=1770320441\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368160/extras_big/1232125c99c17d649685c872d1ce90a8.webp?t=1770320441 width=1560 height=312 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Heart of Muriet weaves a compelling tale of hope, suspicion and betrayal as dark, corrupted forces stir.
