    "description": "Aquadelic GT is a boat racing game in the style of a kart racer – easy to learn, but challenging to master. Enjoy piloting boats with stunning physics. Whilst one is stable in every situation another can be hard to control at speed. There are multiple paint-jobs for each boat, so you can choose one you like. It is also possible to control bigger vessels like yachts and cargo ships for relaxing leisure cruises. And one more thing... Use torpedoes, rockets, mines and even jumping frogs to smash your opponents.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a member of the Aquadelic GT league you will fight to win cash prizes and the support of fans around the world, from the rivers of Russia and the ports of Greece to luxurious Caribbean islands. You'll have to beat rival racers to the finish, and it won't be easy as you're all armed to the teeth with shark torpedos, dragnets, balloon bombs and exploding frogs!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs your fame grows, you can land bigger and bigger sponsors – who will pay you even more money! You may be starting in a ramshackle old tub of a boat, but in no time at all you'll be able to buy a fancy speedboat, or a classy catamaran. Turn your newfound fame into money, and spend it to buy lavish new homes. Why live in an apartment in Russia when you could buy your own Caribbean mansion? Between races, you can move around the world looking for sponsors, giving taxi rides, helping out people in need, or even going for joyrides in seaplanes.",
