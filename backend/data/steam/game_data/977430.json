It serves its purpose to help pass over two hours of free time by engaging yourself in the mesmerizing thrill of earning cash (Karn). You get hooked, minutes within starting by wanting to know, &quot;whats next? and how far can I go?&quot;. Money Maker features over two hours of game-play allowing you to venture through multiples areas, and discover all sorts of things to help you complete the game as soon as possible.

However, taking the time to cool-down from the horror genre has allowed me to come up with some great new ideas for the next horror!<br><br>Thank you very much, everyone! and I will see you on release :)<br><br>Stan.T",
