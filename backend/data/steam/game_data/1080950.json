It was suppose to be a path towards utopia!<br><br>Based on Third-person shooter that doesn't take itself too seriously (it is a game after all).  <br><br>Primary goals of Kaos:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fun-ness!<br></li><li>Make it interesting, full of things to discover with secrets that can be revealed. <br></li><li>Make the rewards worth the effort.<br></li><li>Make it possible for anyone to win without cheats (No level caps.  No getting &quot;stuck&quot; because the &quot;evil&quot; game is not letting you get past...)<br></li><li>Make the &quot;grind&quot; be a personal choice (the more you discover, the less it becomes).<br></li><li>Lots of shooting! But not only shooting (we don't want to cause carpal-tunnel on the trigger finger).<br></li><li></li></ul>Kaos is full of (insert list item below) that we have not found in most games.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>There is a very unique gun crafting system.<br></li><li>Choices matter... from the character you start with to conversations with npc's.<br></li><li>Multiple endings... each will add a perk for the next &quot;new game&quot;.<br></li><li>Much Humor... we do our best to cause laughter!<br></li><li>Sometimes emotional... participation is optional.<br></li><li>NPC's have been directed to NOT speak AT you... please report violations and they will be investigated.</li></ul>",
