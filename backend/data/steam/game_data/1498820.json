    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Game</h2><br>Burkov is a competative shooter set in fictional place on the border between Finland and Russia. In a lawless world contractors work to secure classified intel from secret facilites and closed off areas. Unexplained fenometies such as gravitational shifts and twice as long nights as days has caused several countries to shutdown and leave areas abandoned. This has opened up the oppertunity for lawless individuals to seek riches by forming factions and fight to cease control over areas.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1498820/extras/9945b2ea15853f6cc20be9cbe95f2c05.avif?t=1610040613\" width=600 height=196 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Your Mission</h2><br>Your mission is to choose a faction and work your way up the organization by doing contracts with a POC, also known as Point of Contact. By choosing certain POC's you gain reputation and special rewards. Other individuals, even people within your organization are pursuing the same goals as you, so be aware when securing intel.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1498820/extras/04c111c1faa9a2a42c41ecccfb4e28d2.avif?t=1610040613\" width=600 height=221 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Risk and Reward</h2><br>When pursuing intel you can choose wether you want to risk bringing valuble items into the raid. The more value you bring into the raid, the better rewards you get when meeting up with your POC. Leaving a raid empty-handed will decrease your reputation and the rewards will be minimal. Leaving a raid full with items and equipment, will grant you highly valuables such as gear, money and reputation. Be aware, if you die during the raid you will loose everything you staked.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Net Worth</h2><br>Money is not just a number. Increasing your wealth will not only grant you access to more expensive gear, it will also increase your ranks within the organization. Being famous has it's downsides though. You will put yourself in a more vunerable position if your choose to climb high. Entering a raid as an Elite rank will put you in cornered situations, as more people are willing to kill you in order to claim your wealth. Bearing an Elite badge will also give you less options to escape with your intel.",
