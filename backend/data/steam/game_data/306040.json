    "description": "Use gravity, tension, and wind currents to get your hot air balloon to its destination, dropping off cargo on your way, in this ultra-challenging game.  You'll have to use your skill, wit, and reflexes, to complete all of The Howler's dozens of levels.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll art used in the Howler was meticulously created by classically-trained experienced painters.  The majority of the art was created is by Rene Petruliene: all the graphic design was drawn by hand, on paper, the old fashioned way. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Howler was inspired by Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. The game's locations and architecture actually exist in Vilnius today. Come to Vilnius to see them in real life!",
