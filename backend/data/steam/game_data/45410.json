    "description": "Every race is different in Ignite. Each race brings something new as players try to win by using their own tactics.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tThe score system in Ignite allows for tactics to be used during a race. Gathering score allows the use of nitro in the race and converts to time bonus at the end. So short term usage of nitro can help the players get out of situations ahead of the others but using a lot of nitro and thus score may cost him the game. There are different methods of gathering score (drafting, hitting objects, drifting) and some cars are more suited for a method then the other. Choosing the right car for the preferred method and playing out your strategy will make the player win the game.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key features:</h2>\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Single and multiplayer game:</strong> a 35 races long single player campaign played at 7 locations.
