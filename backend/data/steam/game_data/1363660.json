    "description": "The Emerald Lake is a children's camp located next to the lake. This camp has long been abandoned due to a series of strange events that happened a long time ago. There is no exact information why the camp closed and became abandoned. The main character is Michael, went to this camp to find his brother Peter, who stopped contacting. Peter, along with his friends, loves to explore abandoned places, they have often gone on such trips, but something happened to them in the camp. Michael came there in the hope of finding answers and saving his brother.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a survival horror where you can die. The danger is real and you need not only to find a brother, but also stay alive. The threat is not only enemies, but also an environment in which you can lose one's mind. The atmosphere in the game is a cross between the Soviet Union and the slashers of the 80s. But you are not defenseless, in the game you can use several types of melee weapons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n-quality sounds<br />\r\n-atmosphere<br />\r\n-weapon",
