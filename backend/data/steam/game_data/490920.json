    "description": "Wolfpack is a realistic, first person, co-op U-boat game where one or multiple crews of players man the stations of a highly detailed German type VII U-boat during the Second World War. The crew will encounter large randomized convoys of merchants escorted by destroyers, sloops, and corvettes. Their objective is to intercept and sink enemy ships and escape undetected. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach player mans a station in the U-boat, and the crew will need to cooperate in order to succeed in their mission. Unlike other submarine simulators, Wolfpack is designed for players to procedurally manage the submarine through direct, manual interaction with valves, levers, and instruments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach U-boat has up to five players: The captain, the helmsman, the dive officer, the radio man, and the navigator.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe radio man operates the hydrophone, radio, radio direction finder, and Enigma machine. The helmsman controls the U-boats heading and speed, and operates the torpedo data computer. The dive officer controls the depth using the dive planes, ballast and negative tanks and serves as a lookout and gunner for the deck gun and anti aircraft gun. The navigator calculates the position of the u-boat, and determines the best route to intercept enemy convoys. The captain is the commander of the U-boat, and leads the crew.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWolfpack also features a single player mode where one captain can easily manage his U-boat solo. Plus, it is easy to start a mission solo and allow other players to join the battle in their own subs as part of a wolfpack. The captains can use the U-boat radio to communicate with each other just like the real U-boats did.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll stations and instruments in the U-boat are carefully modeled after original pictures and sources, and kept as realistic as possible without compromising usability. The game contains a fully operational torpedo data computer, manual navigation tools, and ship recognition manual.",
