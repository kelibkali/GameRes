    "description": "Artemis is designed for anyone who watched Star Trek and dreamed of what it would be like to sit on the bridge of a star ship. <br><br>Artemis simulates a spaceship bridge by networking several computers together.<strong> You cannot play Artemis single-player!</strong>  One computer runs the simulation and the &quot;main screen&quot;, while the others serve as workstations for the normal jobs a bridge officer might do, like Helm, Communication, Engineering, and Weapon Control. <br><br>Artemis is a social game where several players are together in one room (&quot;bridge&quot;) , and while they all work together, one player plays the Captain, a person who sits in the middle, doesn't have a workstation, and tells everyone what to do.",
