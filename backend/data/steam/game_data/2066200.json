Use their abilities as well as your  own to traverse the facility. While along the way avoiding hazards and solving puzzles using your abilities. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake control of skeletons that each give their own set of abilities that you must use in order to survive.<br />\r\nAs the human, pick up and throw boxes to help traverse and push buttons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the cat, use your speed and agility to cross chasms and climb up walls to reach the end.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the fish, you can swim underwater and perform a tailspin to activate switches.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd in your blob form, use your tendrils to grab stuff and swing through the air.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, help M-bd3 overcome the many challenges that lie before him and reach the end of the facility.",
