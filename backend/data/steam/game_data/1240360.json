    "description": "In acclaimed action RPG The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, players are charged with defending the world by defeating the epic dragon prophesied to bring apocalypse. Jeremy Soule’s score is equally epic, its massive choirs (“Dragonborn”) and mystical string ballads (“From Past to Present”) stirring feelings of valor while its pianos and harps (“Secunda”) conjure magical vibes. Harkening to other mythological soundtracks, such as those for the Lord of the Rings films, the music of the colossal world of Skyrim is the cornerstone of its fantastical, unforgettable adventure.",
