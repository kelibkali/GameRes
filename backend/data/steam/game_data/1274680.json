    "description": "This is less an &quot;official soundtrack&quot; that it is a companion album. The music in the Pattern release is generated by the movement of the player through the landscape, so there aren't static tracks in the usual sense. What I'm including here are the thematic tracks we'd originally intended to &quot;announce&quot; each environment, but which have been left out of the game to give the procedural music more space.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI'm also including a selection of &quot;walking&quot; ambient tracks recorded live during a few excursions through the environment to reflect something of what the game sounds like during play.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nComposed and performed (and walked) by Michael Bell.",
