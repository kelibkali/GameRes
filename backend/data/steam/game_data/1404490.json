    "description": "Hooray! Finally a weekend, you and your friends want to get thrill? Someone of your friends offered to test their nerves and visit the abandoned Wilkerson mansion, because no one has lived there for a long time and it should be empty, but something went wrong. Once in an abandoned house, four young people become prisoners of the evil living in this house. To escape from this trap, they have to find clues for how open the front door through which they can escape without getting on evil tricks, because it will try to confuse them and interfere in every possible way in achieving the goal. Wherever evil succeeds, it will be fueled and thereby giving itself the strength to use more sophisticated methods of persecution, bringing the poor fellows to death.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt would seem, how can you survive here and not go crazy? Evil is not immortal, and there is a way to contain or weaken it. Inspecting the house you will find tips on how to do that. Having recognized the enemy, pick up protection and it will not be so difficult to get to the exit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game uses voice communication through walkie-talkies, which you can find in the mansion for faster reaction and cohesion, but evil does not sleep, it hears you.<br />\r\nThere are many alternatives to survive, but which one will be suitable, you have to choose yourself. Just as evil will choose how to exhaust you and destroy you in its own way.<br />\r\nAtmospheric music and weather conditions will add an unforgettable experience to your night walk through an abandoned house.",
