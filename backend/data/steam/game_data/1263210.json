It’s me—Deathpuddle.</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You were probably expecting a game description here, something classy, right?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Well, surprise!</strong><br>I kidnapped the guy who was supposed to write this. He’s fine. He’s <i>probably</i> fine. He’s locked in a closet with a Capri Sun and a copy of <i>How to Escape a Closet for Dummies</i>.<br>Anyway, I do my own PR now. <i>Kapish?</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Deathpuddle: Choose Violence?</strong> is a cinematic, choice-driven, darkly comedic adventure where you play as <i>me</i>—a charmingly unstable, currently incarcerated ex-con accused of impersonating a prisoner on prison property and breaking and entering… into people’s hearts.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >I’ve got a past, a temper, and a permanently attached skin-tight blue suit for reasons I absolutely will not be explaining to strangers on the internet.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Deathpuddle: Choose Violence? plays like a visual novel crashed into a movie and nobody got out alive.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Click play. Cause chaos. Regret nothing. </strong></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>The Setup</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >In this first game, I’m just trying to survive the simple journey from prison to work release at a greasy fast-food dump.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >And I <i>would’ve</i> made it too… if it weren’t for the Warden, the SWAT team, and that one horny shopkeeper selling “souvenirs.”</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>What You’re In For</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>The dialogue?</strong> Unhinged.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>The consequences?</strong> Hilarious.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>The path?</strong> Branching like a conspiracy theory rabbit hole at 3 a.m.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This is just the beginning—more games are coming. Each one dumber, wilder, and packed with even worse decisions.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >If you don’t buy this game, I can’t make more.<br>I will hold you personally responsible.<br>Also, you’re gonna make your mother cry.<br>That’s right—I’m dating your mom now. Sorry you had to find out like this, sport.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Buy it and I’ll catch you on the flipside.</strong><br><strong>Don’t… and I’ll catch you slipping like you’re at an ice rink in footie pajamas.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >*The first game is little less than 2 hours of content if you get all of the alternate endings.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Hey, it’s me—<strong>Deathpuddle Prickster Esquire, Fake Attorney at Law.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Obviously, Deathpuddle is a legally distinct, emotionally unstable blue hero. He bears zero resemblance to any red-costumed icons—<strong>especially</strong> ones with high-priced, butt-hurt lawyers who scream <i>“INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY!”</i> like it’s a magic spell.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Do not attempt to impersonate Deathpuddle in real life.</strong><br>Unless you enjoy getting pepper-sprayed inside and out. That’s a real thing that happens in prison… maybe.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Just… seriously. Don’t impersonate me, Deathpuddle... ever!</p>",
