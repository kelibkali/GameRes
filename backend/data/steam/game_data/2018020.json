Winshu is a 4 v 4 bright colorful multiplayer game that has Chinese mythological creatures based on (Chinese guardian lions, aka lion dogs aka foo dogs). These lions have elemental powers such as fire, water, wood, metal and earth. Each lion has 3 powerful abilities and each is equipped with a FPS like projectile along with 2 basic melee attacks. The objective of this game is to either eliminate all of the lions on the opposing team or draw the Chinese character at your enemy base to win. This game is high paced and a lot of of fun.",
