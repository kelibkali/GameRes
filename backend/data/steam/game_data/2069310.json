Powered by the industry-leading RealPhysics™ engine, and designed by both full-scale and RC pilots, flying in RealFlight feels more lifelike than any other simulator. This unmatched realism makes RealFlight an essential tool for any new RC pilots learning to fly. Likewise, experienced pilots love using RealFlight to practice new maneuvers and perfect their technique. Hone your skills in RealFlight's True-to-Life digital environment so you can pilot your physical models safely with confidence and style!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >New Aircraft From The Best Brands In RC</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2069310/extras/e0123cd36a4da245ec1cc9bb772c400b.webp?t=1765911935\" width=149 height=7 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2069310/extras/6631b034a9afec45df121cf7ae2b4568.avif?t=1765911935\" width=616 height=155 /></span><br>With more than 300 different aircraft to fly - including airplanes, helicopters, drones, and more - at over 75 different flying sites, plus the ability to edit and add aircraft and sites, there's an almost infinite number of flying options available.

It also adds more than a dozen of the newest and most popular aircraft from E-flite®, HobbyZone®, Hangar 9® and Blade®, and more than 100 additional aircraft models.

It is specially designed for RealFlight and all your controls will come pre-configured by default.<br></li><li>Option 2: Use your own RC Radio with an interface. The Spektrum WS2000 wireless dongle works well for this, and there are other 3rd-party wireless interfaces available. This option will require some user setup.<br></li><li>Option 3: Use any 4-axis game controller such as a gamepad or an advanced flight stick.</li></ul><br><strong>*Note: See the Announcements and Community Discussion for purchase links.</strong>",
