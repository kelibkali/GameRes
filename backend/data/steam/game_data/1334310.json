There are 2 gamemodes - multiplayer and singleplayer.<br><br>In multiplayer you get into one of many parallel worlds and fight with other players till the last man standing. Winner obtains an artifact. <br>In singleplayer you have to crawl through randomly generated dungeons with enemies, traps and secrets.<br>While you are getting through the levels, you can obtain unique artifacts and resources to upgrade your character. The farther you go, the harder it will become, but the prize will also be better.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1334310/extras/af27befaad4a345299743c7f95b61b0b.poster.avif?t=1687218295\" width=600 height=220 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1334310/extras/af27befaad4a345299743c7f95b61b0b.webm?t=1687218295\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1334310/extras/af27befaad4a345299743c7f95b61b0b.mp4?t=1687218295\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Every part of the environment can be your weapon (If not, we will add it)<br></li><li>Totally destructible (well, almost)<br></li><li>Various levels, each with its' unique items<br></li><li>Procedural levels and their parts - that makes every game unpredictable<br></li><li>Early access.

The last player takes artifact with him. You can't respawn in the match and have only one chance to win.<br>At the start of the match, your only weapon is your fists, but you can pick up  every item that can be a &quot;weapon&quot; (or can't be). Defeat every other opponent and be the last one!

Sometimes you will encounter different sort of traps and obstacles, but also there is a chance to find something valuable.<br>Levels are divided into Realms, but inside each realm they are quite different, with it's own features and secrets.
