They make you believe you're improving at the game, when really you're unlocking things that make your in-game character more powerful. Stabby Machine will not deceive you like this. Except for when you unlock an ability (you unlock it quickly; the reason you don't start with it unlocked is just to smoothen the learning curve), when you beat your high score, it's because <strong>you really are doing better!</strong><br><br>Because of this, Stabby Machine is a very difficult game. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/856550/extras/b4ea446877da6eb6108fe55127e3c5fa.webp?t=1667069437\" width=105 height=25 /></span><br><br>Survive for <strong>as long as possible</strong> by collecting batteries, which are dropped by enemies! <br><br>Watch out! Your battery power drains <strong>faster and faster</strong> the longer you've been playing. <br><br>You must <strong>choose wisely</strong> how many enemies to spawn. Too few and you'll run out of batteries, but too many and you'll be overrun! <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/856550/extras/cccff937138f49551cf9a3189e2a4a72.webp?t=1667069437\" width=105 height=25 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Controls: </h2>Stabby follows the mouse (alternatively you can use W A S D). <br><br>You <strong>MUST GO CLOSE TO</strong> enemies to make them charge, then react quickly to dodge them! <br>If you succeed, the enemy becomes vulnerable and you can run up to it to <strong>stab it</strong>. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/856550/extras/8d0c166b5c6bd9a6f670da764480810c.webp?t=1667069437\" width=113 height=20 /></span><br><br><strong>If you want a difficult open-ended challenge to overcome, then this game is certainly for you!</strong> <br><br>If you want to casually enjoy a new experience, this game can give you that too. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/856550/extras/e9da9b893eb707ba8a16acf83bd14574.webp?t=1667069437\" width=58 height=59 /></span><br><br><strong> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Enjoy!</h2> </strong> <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/856550/extras/dff882f4f6d8353e0366acb038cf965f.webp?t=1667069437\" width=105 height=25 /></span> <br><br><strong> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Strategy</h2> </strong><br>You choose how many enemies to spawn, and you choose when they charge at you.
