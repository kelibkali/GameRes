As a result, almost all modern societies collapsed during the oxygen wars. On the Orbis Island, people survive thanks to a dome maintained and supplied with clean air by the Massive Air Company. However, the origins of the catastrophe remain unknown and the island suffers from a great political instability.<br><br>Carl Thanavan is a young scientist living in the Dome and determined to find the truth. As he accepts to host his sister’s friend Shaimaa, he doesn’t think that this decision will force him to put aside his ambitions and face his fear of the outside.
