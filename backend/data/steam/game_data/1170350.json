Think fast and try and get back your stolen treasure before time runs out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWill you try and get your treasure chests back as fast as possible or will you try to beat your high score!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHit other cannonballs of the same color to knock them out of the level and open up a path to your stolen treasure. Be quick in deciding what cannonball color you need but don't miss! You only have a limited number of Cannonballs per level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGo and get your treasure back!",
