    "description": "<strong>X3: Farnham's Legacy</strong> is a <strong>new game in the X3 space game series</strong>. TRADE, FIGHT, BUILD, THINK in a living and breathing universe. It incorporates a <strong>new storyline</strong> and yet more additions to the open, free-form gameplay that forms the core of all X series games. X3: Farnham's Legacy is <strong>free</strong> to owners of X3: Albion Prelude.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Explore a Changing Universe</h2>Set in the years after X3: Albion Prelude, as the chaos caused by the gate shutdown really takes hold, X3: Farnham's Legacy starts very differently to previous games in the X3 series. Trapped in an isolated area of space, you'll first need to make use of the <strong>new exploration features</strong> to find your way back to civilisation. Then, once you're there, you'll be able to use the new diplomacy options to help shape your relationships with the factions you find.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>(Almost) Everything from X3: Terran Conflict and X3: Albion Prelude<br></li><li>Exploration tools and explorers guild<br></li><li>Diplomacy and dynamic relations<br></li><li>New drone carrier and armoured transport ships<br></li><li>Player headquarters with new advanced facilities<br></li><li>A unique and very special new ship<br></li><li>Station-building and complex planning services<br></li><li>Ship browser and hyperlinked encyclopedia<br></li><li>New piracy options and gameplay<br></li><li>Real sector ownership<br></li><li>Improved logs and graphs<br></li><li>Enhanced modding support<br></li><li>Lots and lots of smaller improvements!</li></ul><br><strong>Note: X3: Farnham's Legacy is not compatible with savegames from X3: Terran Conflict or X3: Albion Prelude.</strong><br><br>X3: Farnham's Legacy has been tested by a small but dedicated team of volunteers.
