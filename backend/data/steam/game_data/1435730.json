    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A unique arcade racer deserves a unique soundtrack.</h2> The Inertial Drift OST is a collaboration between UK broken beat legend Kaidi Tatham and NI electronic artist Kab Driver. Inspired by cult 90s arcade racers but spun out with contemporary production techniques and a distinct jazzy soul - it transports you to a 90s retro-future where the cars are fiercely individual, the tracks are demanding and your opponents are ruthless.",
