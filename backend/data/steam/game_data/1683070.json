Your goal is to fully write the story about what happened that night before 3 AM and by doing so, accepting and understanding the fate you might have unleashed upon yourself.<br><br><strong><u>Multiple Endings</u></strong><br>The game has multiple endings depending on what puzzles you decide to solve, with a total of 3 different endings.  <br><br><strong><u>Time and Puzzles</u></strong><br>The house is divided into left and right sections. Feel free to explore any side you prefer but keep an eye on your pocket watch, you can not pass over 3 am without going insane.<br><br><strong><u>The Book of Blood</u></strong><br>Gamble your sanity with the use of different spells in the book found in the basement creating benefic effects to help you achieve your goals in the mansion. However, everything comes with a price, and sometimes they might not be worth the risk.<br><br><u><strong>Profane / Anxiety / Loneliness</strong></u><br>Your playable character does not suffer any physical damage, however, any other memory that invokes the horrors that happened to him will cause sanity loss. Reaching zero sanity will forcefully end his story for the day.<br><br><strong><u>Jump scares and Monsters</u></strong><br>Jump scares are present in the game and will be used anytime you meet some of the Monsters in the mansion. Be aware of 3 Monsters that will Hunt and watch you. As far as I know, there are only 3.",
