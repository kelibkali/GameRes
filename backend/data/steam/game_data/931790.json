As Viking warriors, players seek to impress the Chieftain by raiding unsuspecting settlements. Players will need to assemble a crew, collect provisions and journey north to plunder gold, iron and livestock. There is glory to be found in battle, even at the hands of the Valkyrie. So gather your warriors, it’s raiding season! <br><br>The aim of Raiders of the North Sea is to impress the Chieftain by having the most Victory Points at the game’s end. Victory Points are gained primarily by raiding Settlements, taking Plunder and making Offerings to the Chieftain. How players use their Plunder is also vital to their success. The game ends when either 1 Fortress raid remains, all Valkyrie are removed, or all Offerings have been made.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Awards &amp; Honors</h2><br>2018 Origins Awards Best Board Game Nominee<br>2018 Mensa Select Winner<br>2017 Kennerspiel des Jahres Nominee",
