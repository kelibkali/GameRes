    "description": "FLUX presents a variety of experiences: Interactive fiction and a series of mini-games that challenge you to type, hack-n-slash, organize or fidget to maintain speed, volume and maximize your rewards to earn cosmetic-buying in-game credits. Designed to allow players to alternate between chill and twitch-based game modes, the game provides players with a number of activities to engage with.​<br><br>Wanderer, an ex-military courier, spends their nights joy riding/flying through the streets/skies of a sprawling cyberpunk cityscape. Working opposite shifts with their long-distance flame, Mulberry, they exchange messages with one another as one wakes and the other heads to bed. Learn more about the two as they exchange stories, get to know one another better, and reveal mysteries that are left open-ended.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1070990/extras/c56ab5cb554b3a5e357ae9b41696228f.avif?t=1602704865\" width=615 height=90 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>​​​​​​Numerous Genres in One:</strong> Fiction, Beat-em-up, Typing, Fidget, Rhythm, Reflective<br></li><li><strong>Meditative Minigames:</strong> Take on a variety of jobs that assume different genre’s goals and objectives, each with a unique pace.<br></li><li><strong>Cosmetics + Cybernetics:</strong> Earn credits throughout your experience and spend them on new outfits, helmets, hairstyles and augments for your body.<br></li><li><strong>Customizable and Chill Tunes:</strong> Listen to the 80s Chillwave groove provided by Quantum Dylan or replace the provided .mp3 files in the install directory and create your own soundscape!<br></li><li><strong>Compelling World:</strong> Text your girlfriend, listen to the news, interact with your environment and converse with locals to learn more about the game’s characters and world.​​<br></li><li>​<strong>Built in Flash:</strong> Yeah, THAT Flash, which means the file size is small and loading times are nonexistent!</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1070990/extras/222ea35886bde370583a60dfe91874d3.avif?t=1602704865\" width=615 height=90 /></span><br>Flux's game modes are treated as &quot;jobs&quot; each day.
