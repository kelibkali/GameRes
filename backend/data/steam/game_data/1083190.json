Monster-themed games came out one after another, and among these titles, a variety of interesting monsters were born. I was influenced by this and used to show off the monsters I thought up and drew on the edge of my notebook to my friends. Disc Creatures is a game I’ve made without forgetting the monsters that were born on the edge of that notebook. While searching for memories of games at that time, I made this game with a feeling of nostalgia myself. If you consider this is nostalgic as well, I ask you to play the game remembering a little about the old days.<br><br>-SATTO<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1083190/extras/779365632c4607055407689bc74fd4f6.poster.avif?t=1751606934\" width=616 height=150 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1083190/extras/779365632c4607055407689bc74fd4f6.webm?t=1751606934\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1083190/extras/779365632c4607055407689bc74fd4f6.mp4?t=1751606934\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Hi all, this is Dan Stern of DANGEN Entertainment! I'm happy to be helping PICORINNE SOFT release Disc Creatures on Steam. I have fond memories of playing games like it when I was younger. SATTO made the whole game solo, which is just astounding to me. Considering the amount of work that goes into making an RPG like this even if you have a whole team, it feels really great to see SATTO get this out to western fans. We're sure you'll love the game and the care that's gone into localizing it. Cheers!",
