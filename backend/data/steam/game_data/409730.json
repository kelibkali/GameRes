    "description": "Welcome to Death by Game Show. A game of pop culture, decision making chaos and hidden parodies starring U.H.Wutt. A lead-footed tub of goo sentenced to rehabilitation in a time of droid tyranny and human ignorance.<br><br>Become the smarts behind Wutt’s rehabilitation, or as the fine print calls it “kidnap-come-illegal-trial-leading-to-banishment-and-death-sentence”. Fight back against the tyranny, free the minds of humanity and find freedom-for-all!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/409730/extras/421e9876994d9264bba902612d5e32c6.avif?t=1560507434\" width=616 height=200 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Twitch Strategy</strong> - Death by Game Show puts survival and success into your own hands.

Can you react decisively and win?<br><br></li><li> <strong>Customization</strong> - You can modify the game’s text, give the droids a paint job and build your own levels. Can you make and share the best via the workshop and win a prize?<br><br></li><li> <strong>Story delivery</strong> - In Death by Game Show the story is told through short social exchanges, battlecries and hidden messages. Can you cut through the BS and find the truth?<br><br></li><li> <strong>Satire</strong> - Death by Game Show is about fictional characters, in a fictional show within a fictional universe based on our satirical view of modern day life. Meanings, metaphors and parodies are everywhere but will you spot them?</li></ul><br>Death by Game Show is still very much being refined and improved.
