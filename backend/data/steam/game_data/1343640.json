    "description": "Welcome to Polyville Canyon! A laid-back, peaceful city builder where nothing bad ever happens!<br><br>Polyville Canyon is a city builder that forgoes many 'standard' city builder mechanics and lets you focus on building an aesthetically pleasing town without having to worry about electricity, sewage, traffic, taxes, city ordinances, or other 'micro-management' tasks. Just get out there and build however you want and the Neighbors will be happy!<br><br>--<br><i>You've been invited to a meeting at a charming little train station just outside of Polyville City by a local construction company. They say they're being asked to build an <i>entire</i> city out in the Canyons, and they desperately need some help. They thought that since you're the only one they know that has a mouse and keyboard, it would be much easier for you to do the work. If you agree, you will earn a share of every Train Ticket sold to visitors and residents, either coming or going!<br><br>Of course you agree because that is A LOT of money, and you immediately pack up your stuff and head to the station! The construction Foreman, Sam, is waiting for you there to get started right away!</i><br>--<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1343640/extras/a3c0aa7911bd998cc5bce20cd57bee02.avif?t=1680735106\" width=616 height=140 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Build a budding city for the Neighbors!</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Build over 100 unique items including Residences, Commercial buildings, City Services and Decorations, Monuments and more!<br></li><li>Build unique towns across four different maps including the Canyon, River, Island, and the all-new Snow Lake map!<br></li><li>Tycoon-style income generation.
