    "description": "Orbital Strike VR is a space combat simulator built from the ground up for VR. This is indie VR so we can take some risks. Instead of a cockpit we launch you directly right out of the carrier and into beautiful fleet battles with intuitive hand-jet flight mechanics. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1350780/extras/8edf9217863bfedc7f782495458afe3e.poster.avif?t=1701673070\" width=620 height=220 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1350780/extras/8edf9217863bfedc7f782495458afe3e.webm?t=1701673070\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>You will progress through a story-rich campaign that can be played as a single-player adventure or you can invite your friends at any time for some co-op action. <br><br>As a pilot for the Starfall fleet, you will serve as a hybrid role of fighter ace and forward observer.
