    "description": "<i>Enter the largest Maze ever created, where time is ticking and death is inevitable. With endless corridors, doors, and traps, can you find a way out and save your beloved?</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Welcome to the Maze</h2>You are a lonely traveler in a magical maze that drains the life out of those who enter. You will die again and again. Endless corridors will drive you insane. But remember - the Maze is not infinite.<br><br>Who you are? Why are you here? Why are you so anxious to reach the end? The answers to these questions are hidden somewhere in the Maze.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About the Game</h2>Maze Gold Run is an intense game where you must find your way out of a giant Maze. The gameplay evolves from slow exploration in the darkness to lightning-fast races in serpentine corridors. This game is only for hardcore players who aren't afraid of challenges.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Maze is huge, and time is ticking.</h2>To survive, you must use the gold you find in the Maze to increase your character's speed and light radius. But be careful, the Maze is draining your life force, and returning to the entrance is the only way to improve your character's skills.<br><br>If your character's health drops to zero, he will die, and bones and found gold will mark the spot of his demise. Along the way, you'll use magic shining sand to mark your path and health-improving phials to stay alive.<br><br>To discover more about the maze's universe, read the notes you find in the maze's furthest corners. These notes reveal curious short stories about the maze's history.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >FAQ</h2><strong>Q: What is the duration of the game?</strong><br>A: Duration of the game (without taking the time to find all story notes) is about 5 hours.<br><br><strong>Q: Is it possible to get to the end of the Maze?</strong><br>A: Yes.<br><br><strong>Q: Is it possible to lose a game?</strong><br>A: Yes, if you thoughtlessly rush forward.<br><br><strong>Q: Who is this game for?</strong><br>A: This game is for hardcore players who are not afraid of difficulties. The game is a real test of the player’s speed and memory. We recommend using a keyboard for the game.<br><br>Q: How large is the Maze?<br>A: It is very large. We believe that this is one of the largest mazes presented in computer games.",
