    "description": "Neofeud is a Dystopic Cyberpunk adventure game in the vein of Blade Runner, but with an overlay of Game of Thrones-like political intrigue, and 1366x768, hand-painted, stylized visuals. The art, writing, programming, music, and audio are made by one person, Christian Miller, also known as Silver Spook, with the exception of 50% of the voice acting.<br><br><strong>Synopsis:</strong><br><br>2033 - We create AI. Sentient robots arrive, but not as our Terminator overlords or our Singularity saviors -- conscious machines are humanity's unwanted bastard children. A few are geniuses who design flying cars, beat cancer, invent teleportation, but millions of defective prototypes roll out of factories -- mentally challenged, motivationally-challenged, criminally-inclined. Legally conscious, but unhirable, these &quot;Defectives&quot; are shuffled through public housing and welfare assistance, straining the already overburdened back of the meager social safety net. The robots who don't end up in prison are dumped, as a last resort, into a massive landfill known as &quot;The Pile&quot;.<br><br>Humans engage in perfection of their species -- or at least the powerful and well-connected -- genetically engineering children with human and animal DNA. The failed eugenics experiment &quot;Frankenpeople&quot; are discarded into &quot;The Pile&quot; as well. The new dynasties, 'Neofeudal Lords', live in towering neon glass castles, shuttle around in pristine nanotech-enabled pods, minds and bodies full of cyberware, spending most of their time taking selfies and &quot;optimizing their monetization schemes&quot;. A race of supermen concerned only with their own status, their prestige, their success. Where machines have become all too flawed and human, people have become flawless, perfect, cold machines.<br><br>Karl Carbon is an ex-cop, dishonorably discharged from Coastlandia PD for disobeying an order to shoot an unarmed sentient humanoid. Karl is exiled to &quot;The Pile&quot; as a lowly social worker. There he counsels gangbanging foster-kid robots and confiscates chimera-children from deadbeat half-wolf parents. Till one day a case goes horribly sideways and Karl is drawn into a sordid conspiracy that could threaten the strained fabric of Human-Robot-Hybrid civilization -- or save it.<br><br><strong>FEATURES</strong><br>-15+ hours of gameplay.<br>-An original dystopic sci-fi world and story that will (hopefully) make you question some of your core beliefs. Or at least my sanity<br>-Tricky yet satisfying, point-n-click detective work, interspersed with tense action shootouts.<br>-Handpainted, uber-gritty, noir futureland. Makes Mad Max and Rick Deckard crap their pants.<br>-Endless bombardment of witty one-liners from hardboiled cyberpunk.<br><br><strong>PRICE</strong> - $14.99<br><br><i>(Content Warning: This game contains imagery relating to violent abductions that may be shocking to some players.)</i><br><br><i>(Warning: Game contains imagery that may affect players with photosensitive epilepsy.)</i>",
