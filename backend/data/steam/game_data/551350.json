    "description": "_Introduction_<br />\r\nThinkToDie Episode 2 is a level based puzzle platformer with over 95 levels (DEMO only 20 levels!) where you goal is to die. You usually accomplish this by smashing yourself with blocks, jumping into spikes or getting shot. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough it might seem very easy at first, you will soon start to realize that as you progress and the more levels you pass, the harder it will become. A fun game shaping up the a suicidal puzzler genre.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game was designed to make you constantly think outside the box and find creative and new ways to kill yourself. As you progress you`ll experience harder and harder levels, new items and objects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n_About the game_<br />\r\nThink To Die -Episode 2 follows the steps of Think To Die part 1. Episode 2 however focuses much more on Quality than on Quantity. Every level has its own level design, and every puzzle challenges the player anew. The music from Part 1 was taken over and a few new background music tracks have been added. The game is now fully in 3D and the graphics have been completely changed. The puzzles are way harder to solve and some controls (like the click-teleportation controls) haven been improved and changed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n_Controller_<br />\r\nThe game is -NOT- meant to be played with a controller, however, it is possible to play most of the levels with it but is not supported.",
