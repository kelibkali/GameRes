    "description": "Choose your dragon and defend the village against invaders in this VR endless flyer game.   Your reflexes will be tested as the dragon's speed increases and split second choices need to be made. Blast undead invaders and collect coins and power-ups while trying to stay alive as long as you can.<br />\r\nWe are looking forward to bringing DragonBlast VR to the community as soon as possible and will be actively soliciting feedback to continue developing a game you want to play.",
