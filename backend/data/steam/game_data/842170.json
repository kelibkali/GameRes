You'll also complete randomized goals in order to finish individual waves. In-between waves you'll buy items that modify your jet in various ways. Zones end with random boss encounters. Difficulty is pretty harsh, you'll probably die a lot in the beginning. But each subsequent run will play out a little different. Throughout the game you'll unlock additional items to find on later runs. The game is fairly light on story, but you can piece together a narrative from item descriptions and combat chatter if you choose so.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/842170/extras/77f8d7d6236f0f70dc5d1580c7cb5500.poster.avif?t=1761726017\" width=120 height=112 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/842170/extras/77f8d7d6236f0f70dc5d1580c7cb5500.webm?t=1761726017\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><strong>Feature list?</strong><br>- Juicy, impact-full and tense 2d air combat, framed in a weird sci-fi universe<br>- 5+ player jets to fly, all coming with 2 alternate starting loadouts to unlock<br>- 200+ different passive items, some providing simple bonuses, some completely changing how your jet behaves<br>- More then 90 sci-fi jet weapons, including beam weapons, explosives and aerial melee options<br>- 50 active items used for offense, defense or utility<br>- Strong focus on synergies and weird jet builds.
