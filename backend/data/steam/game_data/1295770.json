His past is like a ghost, following him everywhere he goes - even in his dreams. His agency is kept together by hope, tape and the hard work of his reliable partner, Gabriela 'Gab' Carter. Then, both private investigators seem to get the solution to their struggle presented on a silver platter, as a former friend of Gab hires them to investigate an ongoing series of crimes against an influential and ruthless industrial tycoon. But as Jack and Gabriela arrive on the island of Thirza, they slowly realize how far away they really are from the civilization they know.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1295770/extras/2a6a7c7a6a9b9a3be19cdd7848e8ea77.avif?t=1588106091\" width=353 height=388 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Not every enemy points a gun at you.
