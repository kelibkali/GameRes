Since that was quite a while ago, I decided to offer the game for free to everyone. I hope some of you will still have fun with the game.<br><br>The game comes with a level editor. If you've created some cool levels, please send them to me so I can make them available to all players.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/801840/extras/6e5823b4d2dc0a8c6e695fd8fcc324fd.webp?t=1726318508\"><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/801840/extras/6e5823b4d2dc0a8c6e695fd8fcc324fd.poster.avif?t=1726318508\" class=\"bb_img\" width=610 height=33 /></picture></span><br>Psychoballs is a single player puzzle game, where you try to eliminate all the spinners on the board by making them contain four balls of the same color at once. Balls travel down given paths around the board, and get caught by a spinner if an available slot is facing them. Spinners are the only parts in the game that can be controlled directly by the player. Players can rotate the spinners clockwise, and can release any of the captured balls into the pipes to move them to other spinners. The goal of the game is to move the different colored balls between the spinners in order to get four balls of the same color in any specific spinner. This straightforward task becomes more and more challenging with the addition of new gameplay elements over the course of the game.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/801840/extras/9ba482812a9686866361e830084ada0b.webp?t=1726318508\"><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/801840/extras/9ba482812a9686866361e830084ada0b.poster.avif?t=1726318508\" class=\"bb_img\" width=610 height=33 /></picture></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>easy to learn, hard to master<br></li><li>absorbing gameplay, that will keep you up late at night<br></li><li>50 mind-blowing levels<br></li><li>new features regularly spice up the game<br></li><li>Level-Editor included</li></ul>",
