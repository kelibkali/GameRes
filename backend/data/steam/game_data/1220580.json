    "description": "Infiltrate a pirate airship and foil the captain’s plans! Can you survive the greedy crew and ruthless officers and disrupt their schemes in time? You’ll hunt merchant vessels, and seek lost treasure while undercover as a sky pirate! <br><br>Escape to the skies above the world of <i>Empyrean</i> and command a brutal crew of pirates in search of plunder, glory, and high-tech booty! <br><i>Sky Pirates of Actorius</i> is a 37,000-word interactive adventure story by Kyle Marquis, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based—without graphics or sound effects—and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br><br>No one on land, sea, or air can stop Captain Krayl as he plunders the great city of Actorius—no one except you.

Your orders: learn Captain Krayl’s true plans and stop him at any cost.<br><br>But far from your commanding officer and surrounded by treasure and opportunity, you will have to decide where your true loyalties lie. If you can deflect Captain Krayl’s suspicions, please your handlers back home, and keep the crew from turning against you, glory awaits you: promotion back in Actorius, fame and riches as a sky pirate, or even the <i>Falling Angel</i> itself. But step carefully: everyone wants something, and everyone here will kill to get it.<br><br>    • Play as male, female, or nonbinary.<br>    • Fly aeros in deadly dogfights against merchant vessels and enemy pirates.<br>    • Stay loyal to the Actorian Air Guard or betray them for glory, treasure, or friendship.<br>    • Outwit spies and rival agents in shady ports of call.<br>    • Command your clockwork animal companion to help you fight, fly, and spy.<br>    • Use cunning and misdirection to balance the conflicting demands of captain, crew, and your secret mission.<br>    • Hunt for buried treasure in the metal jungles of the Deep Tech.",
