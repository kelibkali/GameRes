In this journey, you get to play as three different froggy forms based on your health, with wave-like patterns of enemies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Clean Em Up!</h2>You heard it, it’s a clean ‘em up, not a shoot 'em up. All the animations you see are hand-drawn frame by frame. We hope that this little game can offer you a <strong>short yet pleasant experience</strong>, something that anyone can pick up and put in their library. This game is a love letter to retro gaming, reminiscent of GBA games. We hope you enjoy it!<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428900/extras/faa329b9009e972ec2a10d9aa52c6934.poster.avif?t=1618835017\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428900/extras/faa329b9009e972ec2a10d9aa52c6934.webm?t=1618835017\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Challenge Yourself!</h2>Track your score and compete with others.
