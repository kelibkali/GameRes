    "description": "Treis Zoes Soundtrack by light.in.mist<br />\r\n<br />\r\nlight.in.mist is a project run by two seamen.<br />\r\nAndrii Potapov makes the videos and music dedicated to the places he has visited on ships, that's why the range of genres in his album &quot;In the Lapse of Sea&quot; is so wide. Similarity to Linkin Park, Creed, God is an Astronaut, Red, Bob Dylan and many other famous artists makes the sound very familiar and good to the people who like such kind of music.<br />\r\nTogether with Vitalii Kliiman they create Linkin Park covers, where leap harmonica, guitar, voice and minimal computer post production are used. These covers are named &quot;firEPlace versions&quot;, because their atmosphere is built around playing the songs near fireplace.",
