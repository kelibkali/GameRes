The investigation that followed revealed that a group of people plotting against The City attacked and killed Red's friends. Out of rage, our hero determined to eradicate The City of these villains and thus joined a new movement headed by Cyrus, the CEO of Cycorp. This endeavor promises safety and security from the villains now referred to as The Outsiders.<br><br>Red has earned his title due to his great speed and even greater aim, matched only by his ferocity and undying spirit. Even those beyond The City have heard of Red's amazing accomplishments. After joining The Outsider Resistance Movement, Red received a recently completed weapon from Cycorp that gave Red powerful energy shots, unlimited ammo, and even the ability to defy gravity. With this, his physical might, and his ferocious persona, The Outsiders don't stand a chance!",
