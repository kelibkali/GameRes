But you need to go now before I regret helping you!</i><br> <br>This is Peppe making is way through Italian politics. Later he will try and repay his boss’s secretary with &quot;bunga bunga&quot; services.<br><br>He is:<br>•Lazy<br>•A hood<br>•A Mama’s boy<br>•Pretty dumb<br>•A loser. <br><br>His goals:<br>•Does he want to save the world from the Martians? <br>Well, no. He is for peace, man. And interstellar wars are way too dangerous.<br>•Perhaps he prefers rescuing a damsel from a gorilla? <br>No. That sounds like a lot of work.<br>•Really sure that he doesn't want to rescue a beautiful damsel with long, blinking, eyelashes? <br>Definitely not. Gorillas tend to get annoyed when you do that. And she's probably a pain in the ass.<br>•Then, maybe, he will help the dark side of the Force to prevail? <br>Neither. He can't breathe that hard. Not even on the phone.<br><br>All in all, he just wants to please his mama.<br><br>Will he eventually please her? Will he be successful? Will he prove he is not just a bum, full of promises but weak in character as Mama says all the time? <br><br>Well... that, my friend, kind of depends on you.<br><br>Born in the twisted mind of the Fazz Brothers, Belpaese: Homecoming is the first chapter of an old style, irony-oriented, trick-driven, Point &amp; Click Graphic Adventure. <br><br>If you:<br>•Are one of these old CGA geeks mourning the golden era of videogames. <br>•Think of yourself as a brilliant example of the sparkling new generation of problem solvers (how cheeky).<br>•Are not scared by lateral thinking, actually excited about parading your imagination and your ability to live through tough times. <br><br>If all the above points, or even just one of them, applies to you, then, my fellow traveller, this is your game.<br><br>Have a Great Adventure!<br>Vote for Peppe!<br><br><br>Technical Specifications:<br>•2D Point and Click Graphic Adventure Game.<br>•Playable in English and Italian.<br>•Graphic Adventure Game with more than 2 characters, but less than 1000.<br>•Graphic Adventure Game with day and night locations.<br>•4 hours game (on average).",
