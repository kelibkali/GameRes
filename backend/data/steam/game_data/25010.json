    "description": "Follow Turner, a rebel bunny rabbit with impressive combat skills in his quest to find those<br>\t\t\t\t\tresponsible for slaughtering his village. Uncover a far-reaching conspiracy involving the corrupt<br>\t\t\t\t\tleaders of the rabbit republic and the wolves of the nearby lands.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Streamlined Combat:</strong> Gone are the days of combo memorization and button mashing.<br>\t\t\t\t\tLugaru uses a context-sensitive combat system to put all the moves at your finger tips. It’s<br>\t\t\t\t\tup to you to choose the right move at the right time and think your way through the fights.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Open-Ended Strategy:</strong> Each level presents you with an environment and a series of enemies.<br>\t\t\t\t\tHow you choose to defeat your adversaries is entirely up to you. Storm in from the front and<br>\t\t\t\t\tfight everyone at once or ambush your foes one at a time with stealth attacks.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ragdoll Physics:</strong> Not only does striking your enemies do damage, but so does colliding with<br>\t\t\t\t\tthe environment once you’ve knocked them off their feet. Nothing does more damage than a<br>\t\t\t\t\tswift rabbit kick that sends the enemy hurtling into a stone wall.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Environmental Detail:</strong> Factors like wind direction and whether or not you remembered to clean<br>\t\t\t\t\tthe blood off your knife affect your ability to sneak up on the enemy undetected.<br>\t\t\t\t\tBrutal AI: Enemies in Lugaru prefer unfair fights. Expect them to shout for back up, attack in<br>\t\t\t\t\tgroups, and exploit any superior weaponry they can find.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Moddability:</strong> Turning on Lugaru’s debug mode gives you access to the map editor so you can<br>\t\t\t\t\tbuild your own levels, campaigns and mods. Debug mode also enables crazy cheats that allow<br>\t\t\t\t\tplayers to fly, have infinite health, explode enemies’ heads and set themselves on fire further<br>\t\t\t\t\tigniting anyone who comes too close.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<strong>New HD Textures:</strong> The original Lugaru has gotten a more modern, graphical makeover while still<br>\t\t\t\t\tstaying true to the game’s spirit. Special thanks to Tim Soret for his HD texture pack.",
