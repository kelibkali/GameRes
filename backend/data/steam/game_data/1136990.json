    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Meander Map Pack: Autumn City</h2>This exciting new series of map packs will finally open up the option for building huge destinations to which all the other hundreds of Meanders can lead.<br>Set in Autumn with the characteristic colour-change in the trees and plants, this variant features greater industry, more commerce and larger stockpiles of wood, hay and goods for the long impending winter. Golden brown, red and yellow leaves are scattered far and wide in this windy city - abandon all hope of using a broom to sweep the streets clean. Markets are expanded with many more merchants offering harvested produce and trying to establish themselves before the snows set in.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Main Street Diagonal<br></li><li>Main Street Diagonal B<br></li><li>House Garden Cluster with Well and Stairs<br></li><li>Main Street with Stairs to Terraced Houses<br></li><li>Houses and Apple Pickers with Well<br></li><li>Rough Main Street Meat Cleavers<br></li><li>Main Street Narrow Alley Market Street<br></li><li>Barricaded Street Alley with Thieves Hideout<br></li><li>Main Street with Forge, Inn and Market<br></li><li>Industrial Cluster and Courtyard<br></li><li>High Street Tavern and Boarding<br></li><li>Fenced Cathedral<br></li><li>Poor District A<br></li><li>Poor District B<br></li><li>Twin Cluster with Central Courtyard<br></li><li>High Street Market Alley<br></li><li>High Street Market Alley<br></li><li>Main Street Merchants Alley<br></li><li>Off-Street Well and Rough Courtyard<br></li><li>Poor District Crowded Narrow Cluster<br></li><li>Castle Entrance with Autumnal Forest<br></li><li>Castle Gate Courtyard Vertical Entrance<br></li><li>Castle Gate Courtyard Vertical Entrance<br></li><li>Castle Entrance with Autumnal Forest Roads<br></li><li>Castle Entrance with Autumnal Forest Roads II<br></li><li>High Street Market and Henge<br></li><li>High Street Tavern and Sewer Alley Entrance<br></li><li>Forest Road Castle Entrance Blender<br></li><li>Tavern Courtyard Cluster<br></li><li>Tavern Seated Courtyard Cluster</li></ul>Maps are sized specially for FG at 1350x900 and under 500 kb each to help prevent slow-down during play.
