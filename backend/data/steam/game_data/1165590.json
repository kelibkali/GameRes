Many voice actors, an awesome composer and some great rubber ducks have contributed along the way though.<br><br><strong>Is this a direct sequel to Captive Audience?</strong><br><br>Whilst the game is set in the same universe, it does not directly follow on from Captive Audience, and as such can be played without knowledge of the previous game, though it will definitely enhance the gameplay experience to have played it.<br><br><strong>How did It Will Find You come about?</strong><br><br>After finishing Captive Audience, I knew there were more stories to tell in the universe and began to plan out what could be explored next. At the time I was completing my Masters Degree in Games Design, and thought my final project would be the perfect opportunity to start developing the next step in the saga. From there it continued past graduation to where we are now!<br><br><strong>How many endings are there?</strong><br><br>Currently the game has 8 endings.<br><br><strong>Are there achievements?</strong><br><br>Yes! There are currently 33 achievements in game.<br><br><strong>Are there subtitles?</strong><br><br>Yes! The game is fully subtitled.<br><br><strong>Is there controller support?</strong><br><br>Not at the moment, keyboard and mouse are required to play.<br><br><strong>Did you make the 3D models that populate the game?</strong><br><br>No, I am a terrible 3D modeller and so relied on royalty free assets from websites such as turbo-squid, and the unity asset store. A full list of artists can be found in the credits. Some custom models were also created by Gary Gough, the artist from Captive Audience.<br><br><strong>Who made the music?</strong><br><br>Stefanos Yiassemides was the composer for It Will Find You and created all tracks except for the trailer music. Feel free to show him some love for the awesome work he did!<br><br><strong>Where can I see a list of your voice actors?</strong><br><br>All voice actors are fully credited in the game, so definitely let them know what a great job they did!<br><br><strong>Will there be future updates to the game?</strong><br><br>Whilst there will definitely be fixes and performance patches, content updates are less certain. This is due to working a full time job around solo development, and the fact I believe this story is complete.<br><br><strong>Will there be another chapter in the Captive Audience Saga?</strong><br><br>6 titles including Captive Audience and It Will Find You have been planned out, but the continuation of the series will depend on the success of this title. That being said I love the universe that’s slowly coming into being and would love to delve further into it.<br><br>If you have any further questions please feel free to drop me a message, or comment and i'll aim to reply asap : )",
