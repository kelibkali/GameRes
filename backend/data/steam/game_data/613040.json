    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A new level of escape game</h2> <br>Have you ever played an escape game? That amazing scenario, complex puzzles, where you must pay attention to everything, everywhere, find crazy items in bizarre places, and finally, open that door to victory.<br>What about real-life escape games? Some physical place, where you spend one entire hour inside, looking for clues and yelling at your friends for no reason, until those final seconds, where it all ends and you escape! Or someone comes in and says you’ve failed miserably.<br>Now, imagine an escape game in VR, where you can combine the best of all worlds. You can be 100% immersed in a completely interactable environment, without the boundaries of real world. A fully functioning complex, with countless rooms, and everything fits inside any space you might have in your room.<br>This is the concept of A Lost Room, an escape game without the boundaries of real world. The scale can be huge, anything can happen inside any room, and you’re there, in the middle of it all, on a full-scale VR experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A strange place, where danger could be anywhere</h2> <br>You enter a strange room, where everything is normal. This is just a controlled test. Everything is fine. A scientist talks to you, reassures you that everything is just planned, and nothing will go wrong.<br>But when you escape, and congratulations are in order, something strange happens. That door you’re supposed to get to meet your testers isn’t working. What is wrong with this place?<br>And what about those strange sounds? What is happening in there?<br>Now, your mission is to travel through this huge complex, find out what is happening, and escape.<br>But watch out, something might be lurking behind you...Will it find you first?<br>Beautiful places going wrong, rooms where there seemed to be a battle shortly before, e lots of blood. Will you escape in time? And in one piece?<br> <br><strong>A Lost Room is a full VR game, and requires a VR headset (HTC Vive or Oculus Rift) to be played. A VR capable PC is also required.</strong><br><br> Available for Arcades on SpringboardVR ",
