There are a few options here:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>For the best experience, we strongly recommend the InterLink-X™. RealFlight is designed for it, and your controls will all be exactly where they should be.<br></li><li>You can use your RC Radio with an interface. The RealFlight Wired Interface works well for this, and there are 3rd-party wireless interfaces available. This option will require more setup on your part.<br></li><li>You can use any 4-axis game controller. A gamepad will work, or an advanced flight stick. Your experience will not be as good as using a purpose-built RC radio, though.</li></ul>See the Announcements and Community Discussion for purchase links.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Horizon Hobby Edition Add-On</h2><br>This content pack adds 13 Horizon Hobby aircraft to RealFlight 8:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Blade Fusion 270<br></li><li>Blade Fusion 480<br></li><li>E-flite Apprentice S 15e<br></li><li>E-flite F-27 Evolution<br></li><li>E-flite Mini Convergence VTOL<br></li><li>E-flite Carbon-Z Cessna 150 2.1m<br></li><li>E-flite Timber 1.5m<br></li><li>E-flite Timber 1.5m Float Plane<br></li><li>FMS F-15 64mm EDF<br></li><li>Hangar 9 Carbon Cub 15cc<br></li><li>Hangar 9 Ultra Stick 30cc<br></li><li>HobbyZone Sport Cub S<br></li><li>ParkZone Conscendo Advanced</li></ul>It also includes 2 challenges:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Hangar Obstacle Course<br></li><li>Hangar Obstacle Course II</li></ul>",
