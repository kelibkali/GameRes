    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >  D&amp;D Classics: G1 Steading of the Hill Giant Chief</h2><i>  Giants have been raiding the lands of men in large bands, with giants of different sorts in these marauding groups. Death and destruction have been laid heavily upon every place these monsters have visited. A party of the bravest and most powerful adventurers has been assembled and given the charge to punish the miscreant giants.</i><br><i><br>We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today. Some older content may reflect ethnic, racial, and gender prejudice that were commonplace in American society at that time. These depictions were wrong then and are wrong today. This content is presented as it was originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed. Dungeons &amp; Dragons teaches that diversity is a strength, and we strive to make our D&amp;D products as welcoming and inclusive as possible. This part of our work will never end.</i><br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Mike Wilson, and Terry Buckingham</strong><br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.<br><i>  Converted by:</i>   <br>Terry Buckingham[/b]<br><strong>  Requires:</strong>  The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included 2E ruleset.",
