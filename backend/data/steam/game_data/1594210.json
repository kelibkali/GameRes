The Wisp is invisible, but it can possess and control any friendly plant or animal it finds. You must recruit the animals and natural forces around you to defend your Chrysalis, giving it time to unleash its cleansing power and destroy the monstrous enemies seeking to destroy it.<br><br>Each level plays in a series of &quot;phases&quot;, alternating between Preparation (Roguelike/Exploration oriented) and Defense (Tower Defense oriented). You start by exploring a level, defeating monsters, finding new creatures, collecting resources, and finding new Growths you can use to defend your Chrysalis. Then, the monsters invade, altering the level and sending waves of enemies to attack the Chrysalis.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Tower Defense Roguelike Hybrid:</strong> Navigate dynamic, changing environments while strategically building up your defenses. Items you find while exploring have synergistic effects on both your creatures and your plant-based defenses.<br></li><li><strong>Symbiosis:</strong> take control of any friendly plant or animal in the game.<br></li><li><strong>Metamorphosis:</strong> level up your creatures and plants, transform them into more powerful versions, and apply elemental Spirits for further customization.<br></li><li><strong>Mutation:</strong> a complex mutation system combines different species to create new creatures with unique sets of abilities and metamorphoses. You'll still be finding new creatures with new abilities after dozens of playthroughs!<br></li><li><strong>Customization and Randomization:</strong> at the beginning of each playthrough, you choose a Chrysalis that caters to a specific style of play, with unlockable abilities that increase your power as you progress. By defeating waves of monsters, you will earn random Boons which grant additional passive or active abilities, offering further ways to enhance your controlled creatures.<br></li><li><strong>Procedurally Generated Levels:</strong> No two levels are the same - there are endless possibilities each run!<br></li><li><strong>Permadeath - with a twist:</strong> If a creature you posses with Symbiosis dies, the Wisp survives and can possess a new creature. But if your Chrysalis is destroyed, the game is over - it's time to use the knowledge you gained to start a new playthrough!<br></li><li><strong>Save Anytime:</strong> you can save the game at any time and the entire state of the current level is stored, so you can pick up right where you left off!</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1594210/extras/a8ddf23110bc6e5bfd33ba77218e2b86.poster.avif?t=1761564255\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1594210/extras/a8ddf23110bc6e5bfd33ba77218e2b86.webm?t=1761564255\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1594210/extras/a8ddf23110bc6e5bfd33ba77218e2b86.mp4?t=1761564255\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
