    "description": "“Lucid: Parables of the Ubermensch”  is a pixel art 2D platformer with abstract theming where you walk through the dreams of an unknown entity. Lucid is a game that challenges traditional conceptions of what video games are creatively through an uncompromising artistic vision and a subversion of traditional narrative.  Every level in Lucid has a unique theme, level mechanic, and story for the player to uncover.",
