    "description": "<strong>Quest for Conquest</strong> is a 2D caravan management game, where you play as the leader of a ragtag caravan. Travel around a fantasy land where 4 different cultures have merged, but not always peacefully. Disarray is spreading through the land, and the ruler is doing nothing about it, so maybe it's time to replace them.<br><br>Asking politely most likely won't do the job, so you're going to need an army if you wish to take over the capital. But remember, this is going to be a dangerous journey, so you should always think carefully about the choices you make. It's hard to be a leader if you, and your troops are all dead.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br>Raise your sword<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> ...and promptly put it back down, after you realize that you’re not much of a warrior. Perhaps the role of a leader will suit you better.</li></ul>Gather your troops<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Recruit characters from 4 different races, and turn your ragtag group into a formidable army.</li></ul>Travel across the land <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Explore a kingdom, where the ideologies and cultures of 4 different races have merged.</li></ul>Discover events &amp; encounters<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>During your quest, you will come across different types of events and encounters that require you to make choices. Poor decisions may quickly lead to your downfall, so choose wisely.</li></ul>Manage your caravan<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Use resources to upgrade and expand your humble little caravan, and turn it into a force to be reckoned with. You need to be ready for battles at all times, so keeping your troops well-fed is also a must. Nobody wants to go to war on an empty stomach.</li></ul>Lead your forces to battle<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Just remember your role, and leave the fighting to the real warriors. After all, you need to stay alive if you wish to see your quest to the end.</li></ul>",
