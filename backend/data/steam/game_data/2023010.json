    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >BE A KING RATHER THAN EXPERT</h2><br>The sequel to Toaplan’s legendary vertically scrolling shoot ‘em up masterpiece Truxton brings even more intense hardcore space action. Truxton II is one of the hardest Toaplan games with higher difficulty than its predecessor. The thrilling insane action is unforgiving and appealing to the most hardened shmup veterans. Casual players who dare to play Truxton II can at least take solace in the added easy mode, and the modern features of rewind and quick save that gives a fighting chance to advance through the quick bullet rain and tough bosses.<br><br><i>“The visuals are freaking amazing, not just for their time, but even by today’s standards. It’s one of the coolest looking games ever made.” – Shmup Junkie</i><br><br><strong>The story of Truxton II:</strong><br><i>“During the time of the grand battle known as Tatsujin, another battle was being fought in a remote area of the infinite universe, with similar stakes. The battle was known as Tatsujin Oh.”</i><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2023010/extras/bc412092d47129db0f5bf1ae62b7cb26.poster.avif?t=1771486063\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2023010/extras/bc412092d47129db0f5bf1ae62b7cb26.webm?t=1771486063\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >ORIGINAL GAME FEATURES:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Visually stunning pixel art graphics with intoxicating bosses and atmosphere of dread.<br></li><li>Team up two players co-op with two HyperFighters taking on the insanely difficult enemy.<br></li><li>The blue laser that automatically tracks the enemy is back as a &quot;search laser&quot; in Truxton II, alongside a high-powered red &quot;napalm bomb&quot; and a green &quot;normal shot&quot; that becomes wide-range with power-ups.<br></li><li>Melodic soundtrack with vibrant songs composed by Masahiro Yuge, the legendary musician behind the music to games like Flying Shark, Twin Cobra, and Truxton.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2023010/extras/e442c39139d91c6b94a34e5a72d05eb2.poster.avif?t=1771486063\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2023010/extras/e442c39139d91c6b94a34e5a72d05eb2.webm?t=1771486063\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Minimal Input Lag: Emulation, input processing, and rendering all complete on the same frame.<br></li><li>Quick Save using F1-F10, Reload with Shift+ F1-F10<br></li><li>Online leaderboards for Single Credit, No Assist, and Assisted plays.<br></li><li>Rewind the game between 10-18 minutes, depending on the action.<br></li><li>Capture sharable replays to immortalize your interstellar victories (or funny moments).<br></li><li>Assist Features such as auto-fire at multiple rates.<br></li><li>Very Easy Mode: Lower the difficulty to breeze through the adventure.<br></li><li>Pixel perfect or full-screen scaling in windowed or full-screen mode.<br></li><li>Rotate the gameplay in 90-degree increments.<br></li><li>Steam Achievements<br></li><li>Choose between Raw Input on Windows or Steam Input.<br></li><li>Hone your skills in the ultra-customizable practice mode!</li></ul>",
