    "description": "This game is perfect for speedrun, as you have 60 seconds to complete each level. Your goal is to reach the destination of the level as the goal will unveil itself when all balls in the level are popped using cones with matching color. This game requires timing, patience, and critical thinking as you have to figure out a way to reach the destination in under 60 seconds, by efficiently popping balls. Avoid being hit by the obstacles and falling from the stage as you need to  move efficiently to continue to the next level. There are total of 100 levels and you may be expected to finish in 2-5 hours depending on how fast you adapt and if you can figure out the optimal way to move around the stage in order to clear in time. Sometimes, the goal won`t open up unless you drop the cone.",
