    "description": "<i>Strap on your dandy Tesla Shield and hop in your “Billy Bub” jalopy!</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >2D done better</h2><br>GRITS Racing is a <strong>party game</strong> for up to <strong>8 players</strong> that is part racecar simulator, part cartoon action.  First, we built the most realistic 2D racer ever... and then we smashed it up into a bizarre party game out of a desire to play a “racing” game with more than just racing fans.  <i>We</i> provide a physics playground with sim-like cars, minimal rules at the start, and <i>you</i> decide what to do with it by adding wacky rules between races.  Good luck keeping your wheels on!<br><br>⚡ Includes the best 6-8 player couch minigame on the planet: <strong>Prison Dodgecar!</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Whaaaaat???</h2><br>Old school gets a new-school makeover with more damageable physics objects than you can shake a two-dimensional polygon at.  And, oh, the skids marks!  Did we mention the oddly satisfying skid marks that dirty up the track like never before?  And the dirt doesn't end there.  With debris everywhere from lost wheels, broken cars, oily tire tracks, various track objects, and up to 8 players on one screen generally making a mess of it all, just getting to the finish line can be a friend-testing brawl of gasoline-fueled tenacity.<br><br>Welcome to the petrolpunk world of Globetrotter Racing where it's 1975, The Great War was the only world war, and microelectronics do not exist... probably because no one cared about going small after Nikola Tesla and his research institute learned to harness the power of lightning—to put it simply—and invented the Tesla Shield™ for use in automotive safety and generalized pedestrian protection (GPP).<br><br>GRITS Racing is a family-friendly game for discharging some electricity in a safe environment.  If somebody isn't laughing, giggling, snickering, or snorting most of the game... we aren't doing our job correctly.  We get it, not all players will choose to race, so we've given them other ways to be part of the environment (for better or for worse).<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/907190/extras/2138edd9f6d7b46b2cbc5b809c831704.webp?t=1667313852\" width=616 height=44 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><br><strong>Realistic 2D car physics:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Proprietary physics code<br></li><li>These 2D cars actually steer via the wheels!<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Nearly all other games in this category just pivot their cars on center.

So, in desperation, he was looking about his pit area for a new idea to fix it when he spied his leftover pancake batter from breakfast.  He thought “It couldn't possibly be any worse, could it?”  Well, actually, yes, it was worse.  Much worse.  But the crowd loved the results and the rest is lost in history.  No one remembers for sure who this racer was but legend has it he was called Juan Tabo.  Official records proving the existence of Jaun Tabo have yet to be found but this hasn't stopped governments from naming libraries and schools in his honor.<br><br>The sport, then known as Wiggle Wheel Wacing, languished in the backwoods of the Southern United States for years before Gilded-Age billionaire, Billy Bub Worcestershire, bought the rights to it and turned it into the mid-budget international sport known as Globetrotter Racing.  Mr. Worcestershire had previously made his fortune with the invention and popularization of deep-fried grits biscuits and, as he stated it, “I understand food batter and believe in the future of all its lucrative properties.”  Deep-fried grits also became the sport's official snack food.  When the Tesla Institute later developed the personal plasma energy shield (PPES), or Tesla Shield™, Mr. Worcestershire incorporated these shields into Globetrotter Racing and this variant, coincidently, became known as GRITS (Globetrotter Racing Incorporated, á la Tesla Shields).  Apparently influenced by GRITS' stock-car cousin, Banger racing, the official snack food of GRITS became bangers and grits (deep fried and otherwise).<br><br>Still reading?  Then,  and talk to us.",
