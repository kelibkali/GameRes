    "description": "<strong>Netsoccer</strong> is an awesome free multiplayer 2D football game with great traditions. Each gamer controls a player, not a team as is common in most soccer games. You are moving into a virtual pitch and control one player against other players! You train, play matches, score more goals, assists, winnings and rise in the ranking. You can join different teams and have matches against other teams or you can just have a practice match online.",
