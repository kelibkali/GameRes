    "description": "You are a vampire girl and you go to school. Your classmates are cowboys, vampires,  pirates, and ghosts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour character has stats: health, hunger, thirst, energy, bladder, and hygiene. Please keep them in a good state: if you are hungry, eat some food, if you are thirsty d drink some beverages; if your hygiene is low, wash your hands; if you low on energy, sleep.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou have to collect smiles. Almost every activity spawn smiles, also you can watch TV, visit museums, play arcades or go to a fast-food restaurant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf your stats are below some particular level or your grades at school are bad, your smiley's score will slowly go down until you fix your stat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a small life sim game. I hope it will give you some fun time.",
