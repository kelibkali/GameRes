    "description": "Kingdom Of Galanor is a multiplayer (with optional offline mode) RPG, set in the fantasy realm of Galanor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a fledgling hero, you find yourself in the town of Fernville in the kingdom of Galanor. You will learn your combat craft by fighting and defeating the many creatures that inhabit the kingdom and performing tasks for the Galanorians that need your help. Catch, train and fight alongside pets and also team up with other players to defeat the more dangerous threats you will encounter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can be one of several classes, Warrior, Wizard, Witch, Valkyrie, Necromancer and Hunter. Each class has its own set of unique abilities, which you will unlock as you gain experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are hundreds of quests to perform, which will help your character gain experience more quickly than from just fighting creatures and they reward cash and sometimes high quality equipment or other rare items.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLearn various professions and level them up to create better quality armour and stronger weapons than you would otherwise be able to obtain, which you can also sell to NPCs or trade with other players. Learn the apothecary and cooking professions to make powerful potions and food to boost your stats and recover health and mana. You will need to hunt or gather various raw materials which can then be crafted into armour, weapons etc. Whilst this can take some time, especially for higher level items, you can log off or switch to another character and your crafting will continue while you are away and be ready for you next time you log in.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe party system allows you to team up with up to 4 more players and their pets to help overcome threats that you can't handle alone. Some areas of the game will be tuned for groups and will reward better quality loot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany of the creatures that inhabit Galanor can be caught and tamed and then used to fight alongside you. They will gain experience and new skills as they level up and can become powerful allies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can play online in player hosted games with up to 50 other players (games will persist if the original host disconnects), or you can play offline in single player mode, and you can switch between the online and offline mode and maintain your character progression.",
