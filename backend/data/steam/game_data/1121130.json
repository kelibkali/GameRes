    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >D&amp;D Classics: REF5 Lords of Darkness</h2>The Undead. Denied the eternal rest of Death, cursed to wander the many planes and worlds forever, their very existence a mockery of life they constantly crave yet cannot have. Created by the foulest of magics, they have only one thought, on burning goal: revenge against the living. Or do they?<br>Lords of Darkness is an anthology of short adventures set in various locations in the Forgotten Realms, though you don't need the Forgotten Realms campaign supplement to use them.<br>Some of gaming's best designers have contributed adventures to this collection, which feature undead of all types and descriptions in all sorts of situations-from skeletons to vampires and worse, from graveyards to haunted houses, and even a few places you may never have expected to find the undead.<br>These adventures can be used one at a time, inserted into an existing campaign as a change of pace, or they can be a basis for an entirely new campaign. Either way, Lords of Darkness will be sure to give Advanced Dungerons &amp; Dragons game players plenty of chills and excitement.<br><strong><br><i> We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today.
