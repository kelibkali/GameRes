This mode is playable in teams (eg. 2vs2, 3vs3, etc)<br></li><li> In capture the flag mode each team will have a planet assigned, and a flag spawning around it, to goal is to steal the enemy flag and bring it back to your own<br></li><li> In conquest mode, some planets will be conquerable, take a stable low orbit around it, and you'll start capturing it. Once a planet it's capture it'll start generating points for your team. But be careful, planets can be captured back the same way!</li></ul><br>Maneuvering in space is hard and requires some time to get used to it, but anyone can master it! A hint? Try to think about where you want to be 5 seconds from now instead of trying to go there now.",
