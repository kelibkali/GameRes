    "description": "Mentai Uncensored is a relaxing puzzle game in which the goal is to restore the picture to proper orientation by rotating bricks.  Occasionally an event will occur mixing your bricks to random rotations, the rate at which this happens can be sped up by selecting a higher difficulty setting.  You can select from three difficulty settings that will increase the rate which the event occurs.  With 3 difficulty settings and 60 puzzles there are tons of fun for you to enjoy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n60 Puzzles<br />\r\n3 Difficulty Settings<br />\r\nRandom Puzzle Creation<br />\r\nRandom Brick Rotation Event<br />\r\nRelaxing Music",
