    "description": "<p>Kiora Atua’s fully unlocked “Ancient Depths” blue-green deck for Magic: The Gathering — Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012. Kiora Atua is a newly-discovered Merfolk planeswalker with a fierce mastery of aquatic forces. Able to command the powerful oceans and the creatures that dwell there, her calm demeanor belies a fury borne of the darkest depths. Her deck is all about massive, game-ending monstrosities and getting them onto the battlefield very quickly. Take advantage of land and sea to build your power quickly and unleash a wave of aggression!</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>(Contains no new content. This content is also available through game play.)</p>",
