You play as Vuinten, a hero who's been thrown into the games because he murdered a religious leader. As you fight your way through the games, trying to defend yourself and expose the evil Alt religion for what it is, you'll be able to unlock numerous armors, bullets, aimers, and slashes. <br><strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1182790/extras/b7ad4e2f4f996f820c35509d48cad42c.poster.avif?t=1599753906\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1182790/extras/b7ad4e2f4f996f820c35509d48cad42c.webm?t=1599753906\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1182790/extras/b7ad4e2f4f996f820c35509d48cad42c.mp4?t=1599753906\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Will there ever be any paid DLC or items ingame that will cost real money?</strong><br><br>This game is free to play.
