    "description": "Relive the days of classic gaming with <i>The Filmmaker</i>, a puzzle-filled text adventure that pays tribute to the classic, cheesy Hollywood B-Movie!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About</h2><i>The Filmmaker</i> combines the best elements of interactive fiction, visual novels, and gamebooks with a graphic user interface that emulates the look of early 1990s text adventures. It features beautiful artwork and cinematic music. In place of a text parser is a context-specific multiple choice menu. A compass allows you to travel from room to room, and separate inventory, map, journal, and character screens are available at the push of a button.<br><br>It plays like an interactive novel. You make choices that determine what happens next in the story.

Little did she realize, however, that she was in for a bit more than she bargained for...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>EXPLORE a haunted theater<br></li><li>ENTER five distinct black-and-white films<br></li><li>DISCOVER the terrifying link behind a series of gruesome murders<br></li><li>HELP Brianna overcome the loss of her father<br></li><li>SOLVE a multitude of challenging puzzles<br></li><li>ENJOY over 400 pieces of original artwork and an hour-long soundtrack<br></li><li>EXPERIENCE two different endings, depending on your actions in the game<br></li><li>UNLOCK 25 achievements to view a special post-game bonus scene<br></li><li>PLAY 6+ hours of content--a true “B-movie” experience!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Films</h2>You'll go <i>inside</i> five distinct black-and-white B-movie films, each of which features unique exploration, visuals, music, and puzzles!
