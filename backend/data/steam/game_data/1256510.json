    "description": "Dreadtides is a strategy game with a focus on citybuilding and combat set in a fantasy world that has fallen to a magical corruption. This apocalypse has consumed all other life, transforming people and animals into nightmarish creatures that further spread corruption. These monsters have discovered you, the last remaining survivors, and now your people must fight for their survival. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPush back the corruption, and explore the lands where your ancestors once thrived. Discover resources, explore ruins, defend supply lines, and build factories to create the materials needed to defend your people. Expand your city, build defences, and train units capable of defeating corrupted monsters. Then, once you've amassed enough strength, take the fight to the enemy, and purge the corruption from this world.",
