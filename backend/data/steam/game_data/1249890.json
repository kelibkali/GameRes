We avoid using classic graphic user interface as we believe it doesn't work well in VR.<br>Instead you will find objects which can be interacted with, within the scene:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Guns - You will find weapon pick-ups scattered around the maps. Red weapon avatar means weapon is locked, blue means unlocked. Number under the avatar indicates the score needed to unlock the weapon. When you are within pickup range (you need to walk over it), you will see blue particles raising from the base of the pickup. Press the grip button on your controller to pick the weapon (you can have a gun in each hand)<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1249890/extras/08b81fa605cc4abc0b9d74ae360aa6a4.avif?t=1589228252\" width=600 height=342 /></span><br></li><li>Settings tent - Five quality levels can be activated here, each represented by number of blue bars.
