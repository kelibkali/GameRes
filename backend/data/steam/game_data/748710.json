    "description": "A terrible <strong>accident</strong> at a nuclear test site has led to a radioactive cloud engulfing the suburbs.<br><strong>Mount Hill</strong> citizens got stuck at ground zero of the infection zone, and were forced into <strong>quarantine</strong>.<br>The radiation poisoning is off the charts, and those lucky enough to survive started giving birth to hideously mutated, <strong>violence-prone</strong> offspring.<br>In an effort to cover up this disaster, the government ordered the military to <strong>wipe</strong> the whole area off the map.<br>Those who managed to escape moved to the <strong>hills</strong>, a place they now call home, where they can exact <strong>revenge</strong> for the crimes committed against them.<br>It doesn’t matter who they attack, the only thing that matters is that no one make it out <strong>alive</strong>.<br>These once peaceful citizens have been reduced to <strong>blood-thirsty</strong> mutants, craving nothing more than to <strong>kill</strong>.<br>Now that you’ve fallen into their trap, you have to beat all the levels, relying on your own tactics as the only chance for <strong>survival</strong>.",
