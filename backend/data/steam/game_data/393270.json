Now, bound by a powerful spell, the castle not only became home to demons and magical creatures, but has also been affected itself by the evil power... It bends and shapeshifts, forming layers upon layers of transformation and illusion... It is an essential part of the plot, and - especially later in the game - an element tightly integrated into the gameplay.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/393270/extras/9088712adac276c62f1fe3ea099f48ef.avif?t=1542887514\" width=616 height=288 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You can &quot;die&quot; in this game! - It's an adventure game, so explore, solve puzzles... but beware.

Don't let appearances deceive you, some seemingly nice people may not necessarily have the best intentions, and a seemingly terrifying monster may not be all that evil. Fortunately, even when events turn for the worst, Tsioque can always count on help from her friends, which she will find in least expected places.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/393270/extras/633beb48ca7c7cb20c9d32a72c300c07.avif?t=1542887514\" width=616 height=286 /></span><br><br>The main inspiration is inarguably LIFE, which always writes the best scritps. But of course we're not living in cultural vaccuum. While creating TSIOQUE, we couldn't help but be inspired by things that thrilled, shocked and amazed us in the past, that burned forever into our memory in the childhood days spent in front of the pale light of CRT monitors. <br><br>Among many other inspirations, we could certainly count: a smart, humorous story backed by beautiful art style of DAY OF THE TENTACLE, simplicity of the gameplay and a serious approach to a younger player in games by Ron Gilbert like PAJAMA SAM, a vivid, dangerous world seen through the eyes of a boy in HEART OF DARKNESS, wonderfully animated epic fantasy and its gruesome punishments for failures in DRAGON'S LAIR, or INDIANA JONES AND THE FATE OF ATLANTIS, an old Lucasarts classic with a perfect blend of adventure, humor and action, where carelessness could cost you dearly.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/393270/extras/452cff6e05a0988303ecc2049f1296b7.avif?t=1542887514\" width=616 height=196 /></span>",
