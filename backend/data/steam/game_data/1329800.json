    "description": "Your orders are to surrender, but you prefer death to dishonor. <br><br>Instead, you hold your position behind two bunkers with nothing more than your assault rifle and a bloodlust. Face off against the invaders and survive several waves of attacks. As you take on the enemy, their general will devote more resources to the fight in hopes of crushing you. He will send helicopters, tanks, planes, artillery barrages, and eventually grab his shotgun and come after you himself. What he doesn’t know is that there is no stopping you.<br><br>Remember that you have allies who will drop health packs and weapon upgrades. Choose between eight possible upgrade paths that best fit your play style. <br><br>Only you can stand up to them. If you can destroy their army and kill their general, you could end the entire war.<br><br><strong>Soundtrack:</strong><br>Wave 1 - Hey Sailor By Letter Box<br>Wave 2 - Vindicated By Ethan Meixsell<br>Wave 3 / Intro - Unusual Habitat By Silent Partner<br>Wave 4 - Loitering By Riot<br>Wave 5 - Pentagram By Audionautix<br>Wave 6 - Driven To Madness By Ethan Meixsell<br>Wave 7 (Final Wave) - Beat Down By Silent Partner<br>General (Boss) Fight Song - Angel Of Mercy By Ethan Meixsell<br>Credits Song - Highway Girl By Riot<br>Death Song - Keep It Real By Audionautix<br><br><strong>Sound Effects (FreeSound):</strong><br>“Artillery Gunfire” by Qubodup is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>“AssaultRiflePack1” by SuperPhat is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>“Box of stuff falls” by AnimationIsaac is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>“Cannon Shot” by Qubodup is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>“Carbonfiber15” by Hiramjustus is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>“Explosion2” by Steveygos93 is licensed under CC BY 3.0<br>“Explosion_01” by Tommccan is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>“Explosion” by Omar Alvarado is licensed under CC BY 3.0<br>“Fabric Ripping” by HarpyHarpHarp is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>“Gun lee enfield 303 rifle fire shot” by Kyles is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>“Hitting metal object with metal” by Jorickhoofd is licensed under CC BY 3.0<br>“HQ Explosion” by Quaker540 is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>“Male_Scream_2” by AlineAudio is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>“Man getting hit” by Under7dude licensed under CC0 1.0<br>“Scream 01” by Adriancalzon is licensed under CC BY 3.0<br>“Scream 05” by Adriancalzon is licensed under CC BY 3.0<br>“Shotgun Cock Reload Layered” by Paul368 is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>“Shotgun_Shot_01” by Mattix is licensed under CC BY 3.0<br>“Single Pistol Gunshot 3” by Morganpurkis is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>“Squish Impact” by Bertsz is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>“Tank Firing” by Qubodup is licensed under CC0 1.0",
