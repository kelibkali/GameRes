    "description": "Experience a day in the life of a common bullfrog.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour home environment is being polluted. The very water in which you live is becoming poisonous to the touch. To live another day, you will need to find a new, healthier ecosystem.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe journey will not be easy! Your creek is home to many natural predators and other obstacles–-all of which you will need to pass to find your new home. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt’s a big day for a little frog.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n--<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrogworld is the first release from NatureSims, an indie studio dedicated to building first-person VR experiences that bring users closer to nature. Please note that the game requires a compatible VR headset and SteamVR to be installed on your computer for the headset and controllers to work properly.",
