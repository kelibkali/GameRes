This support is much like a theater display mode.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/720460/extras/da4b611c0fc79989d5ec15560088a472.avif?t=1587561777\" width=634 height=106 /></span><br>Apocalypse is an upcoming first person shooter built entirely by one developer. Completely focusing on wave based survival, with all of the latest graphics technologies integrated together, such as Physx 3.3, Unity 2018.2, Directx 12, and the Vulkan API. Currently with 3 modes, 7 maps, 3 characters, and a missions preview included too for a glipse of the future.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/720460/extras/632417f9e6be8412bb359aa46af76024.avif?t=1587561777\" width=634 height=106 /></span><br>Apocalypse is split between 3 modes, firstly, there's the pursuit and outcast modes, both are wave based survival, each of them have 3/4 different maps, both interior and exterior. Secondly, the missions preview will show players what I'll be integrating in the future, with 2 different areas and 2 characters. In the future I'll be adding more content across the board.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/720460/extras/1378bbfbd1529dba8cab4efc9b549846.avif?t=1587561777\" width=632 height=106 /></span><br>This is a very different title compared to most development projects, because this is a solo project, I'm completely open to ideas, improvements, and implementations. After playing you can head to the community page, the twitter page, or the website and give me feedback.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/720460/extras/fcd0d18b1fcd20c766793b2f234e6315.avif?t=1587561777\" width=634 height=106 /></span><br>Thanks for checking out apocalypse's steam page, don't forget to have a look at the twitter account, the discord page or the community hub for constant development updates.",
