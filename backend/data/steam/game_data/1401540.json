At an age of seven, he fell in love with video games when he played on his uncle’s PC for the first time.<br>Since then he knew that this is what he'll be doing for the rest of his life.<br>The game is his first publisher-supported commercial release and is highly inspired by the works of one of ZAX’s favorite game creators Edmund McMillen.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1401540/extras/skull-line_small.png?t=1718007790\" /></span><br><br>When Tiny got lost in the underworld forest, he stumbled upon the devil. Tiny agreed to a foolish and naive deal: in return for finding the devil's lost horn, he would be rewarded with love and fame. But will the devil fulfill his end of the bargain?<br>The world of <strong>Tinyshot </strong>is full of cute yet tortured creatures living in the underworld, a place the player must navigate to achieve the goal of finding the horn.<br>With each level, you will be equipped with guns and melee weapons to help you conquer waves of enemies. You will also improve your ability to move smoothly around the environment using mechanics like the grapple gun or dash abilities, because dodging enemies is as important as blasting them.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1401540/extras/tinyshot_steam_description_features_AUG2020.png?t=1718007790\" /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The art style is a mix of realistic nature elements with flash/cartoony looking creatures.<br></li><li>The game feel is one of the most important elements, designed to satisfy the player.<br></li><li>Challenging boss battles and enemies.<br></li><li>Random items to be picked up on the battlefield.</li></ul>",
