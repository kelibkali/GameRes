    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story</h2><br>Satoshi Kanamori attends the world-renowned Ryokufuuin Academy as a scholarship student. Thanks to his scholarship, he doesn't have to worry about the tuition--a critical concern for the eldest son of a poor family of six (and a sheep). Despite that, Hitomi Miyazono, a cute underclassman who adores him with everything she's got, Ayame Enatsu, his trusty aid willing to lend an ear to all his troubles, and the seemingly blunt and abusive Rin Washio, his closest friends, have no idea about his financial situation.<br><br>The weight of attending such a prestigious school sometimes becomes unbearable, but he's enjoying his busy student life at this glamorous establishment. One day, however, Kana Takamine, the school's biggest celebrity, gives him a life-changing assignment:<br><br>&quot;Satoshi, you'll play the leading role during this year's Ryokufuu Fest.&quot;<br><br>Follow Satoshi on his journey to make the festival a success, all the while strengthening his bonds and finding love in his rose-colored student life.
