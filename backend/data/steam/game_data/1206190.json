After volunteering at our local hospital, they realized there were specific ways games could help children cope with long-term visits. They’ve since evolved into a community of gaming enthusiasts eager to make a difference for kids in hospitals everywhere!<br><br><i>Why It’s Important:</i><br><br>Undergoing medical treatment can often be a scary and isolating experience, especially for young people. There is a special need for age-appropriate coping tools in pediatric hospitals. Gamers Outreach programs help aid the healing process by providing relief, socialization, and a sense of normalcy to families and patients spending time inside hospitals.<br><br><i>What They Do:</i><br><br>Their focus is to support kids and teens throughout the healing process as they undergo treatment in hospitals. They equip nurses and child life specialists with the means to make activities and technology accessible. Ultimately, their goal is to create sustainable experiences that produce joy and minimize trauma for patients.",
