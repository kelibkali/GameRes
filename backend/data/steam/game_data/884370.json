Note: Popstic mode requires a Popstic accessory and does not currently work on the Rift (Vive only).  Only choose Popstic if you have the Popstic accessory attachment. This is a prototype accessory.  If you do not have this accessory, and would like to order one, please visit our website for more info. We also encourage you to make your own as needed and we welcome any feedback. The Popstic mode is optional and offers players an additional type of gameplay experience.  The game is fun to play with and without the Popstic.</li></ul>",
