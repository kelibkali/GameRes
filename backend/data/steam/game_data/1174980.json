On a square surface you play synths, drums, sampler, sequencer, filters and effects. Together, all the instruments form the Hypercube. Hyper- What?. The Hypercube is a space that changes your music multiperspectively....<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe principle<br />\r\nThink of a record player, play the vinyl from 33 to 45 and everything sounds higher and faster. Conversely from 45 to 33 everything sounds slower and lower. It remains the same song, only the conditions are changed. Mutant works in a similar way. You play in a beat loop, then turn the Hypercube and hear everything from new perspectives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to this principle, new ideas and results emerge in the musical process. These don't have to reach perfection. Mutant stands for experimenting, making loops and exploring sound, it's the session, the moment and an audio recording that counts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom Snapshots to Cloud Mutation<br />\r\nTo capture the loops you've created, take a snapshot - an anchor point with all the instruments that you can always return to.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLoad your snapshot into the cloud and locate it in three dimensions with Mood, Energy &amp; Structure. If you then select another snapshot, it will be mutated in certain ways and many new perspectives will emerge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCollaboration<br />\r\nIn Collab Mode, two Mutant users can make music together via local network. All inputs are transmitted live and the people each play instruments or effects.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nApp information<br />\r\nWe do our best to avoid bugs, often enough we were disappointed when a moment was lost. But at some point it has to go out and after the update before the next one. So feel free to write us bugs and problems, definitely also if you made a song or video.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe cloud is offline, but technically designed to be part of an online cloud for own user data and content sharing in the future. It was created as part of the Mazetools Assist research project. You can read more about it at Ectoplastic.com.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMutant requires the microphone for audio recording, the local files to store projects and recordings, and the network for Collab Mode and Ableton Link.<br />\r\nMuch more content, terms of use, credits and FAQ are in the app in the Guide and can be found in the app's Start-Up menu.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout Mazetools<br />\r\nEmpowering creativity, democratizing musical expression and making it inclusive - how does that work? These are the questions that keep us busy. Mutant is a further step in the process, alongside Soniface, and provides important points of contact through the multitouch-based loop principle, the change of perspective and the cloud. But we want to go further - with you and the community.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe are Stephan Kloß and Jakob Gruhl, Ectoplastic from Halle/Leipzig, we first met in 1999 as teenagers to make hip hop and electronic music. Since then we have been fascinated by music software and sharing our enthusiasm for it with people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore than 10 years ago we started the Maze project - a software core of instruments and multimedia interfaces. Since then we have been dedicated to audiovisual connections, sound through movement and spatial audio. Through exchanges, sessions, research and development, and public funding, Maze became Mazetools.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur roadmap follows the goal of improving workflow, experience, energy consumption and new features of our previous Mazetools Mutant and Soniface. Here we are always open to ideas and constructive feedback. In 2024, we have two new releases coming up, Mazetools Botany and Modyssey VR. We have developed these over the last three years. To make it all work, we need your support!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe wish you a great time with Mutant,<br />\r\nStephan &amp; Jakob",
