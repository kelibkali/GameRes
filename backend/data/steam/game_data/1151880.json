    "description": "<i>A Desire for Change? We all desire change in our lives. We all want to be happy no? Then desire with all that you have in you, and your wish shall be in your grasp.</i><br><br>Those Chosen By God<br><br>Is a story driven, text heavy rpg that's more story than gameplay. It follows the life of Aden. (Pronounced in game as  /ah,  den/ ) Born into an appalling void known as the world.  Aden must fight both mentally and physically If he wishes to survive the cruelty thrown at him.<br><br>IMPORTANT: After downloading go to your steam folder&gt; steamapps&gt;Common&gt;Those Chosen By God&gt; It is very important that you have inside this folder the www folder&gt; save folder, and an overlays folder. Inside the overlays check the pars folder it should have par1, par4, par5, par6, par7, and par23.<br>It is very important NOT to mess with these files. DO NOT rename or delete them for they will make the game unplayable. You can copy the Those Chosen By God folder to your desktop, however don't mess with any of the files. Or the Those Chosen By God.exe file for a shortcut.<br><br>HINT: If an enemy seems too strong, make sure you raise your stats, learn better skills, and equip the skills. All found in the skill menu when you pause the game. Skill&gt;Learn Skills, Equip Skills. <br><br>HINT: If you need help there is a link to my youtube page with a walkthrough guide on the stores page.",
