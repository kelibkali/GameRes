    "description": "Difficulty adjustments and controls overhaul coming soon!<br><br>COMPOUND, while still a very early work in progress, is a randomized, rogue-lite, free-roaming shooter for Virtual Reality veterans. Duck and dodge around enemy fire in a tough-as-nails retro FPS with multiple locomotion options. Prepare to die - a lot - until you are good enough to reach the heart of The Corporation and take back what belongs to everyone...<br><br><strong>What is this?</strong><br>The concept of COMPOUND started as an attempt to move away from the 'wave shooter' formula common in early indie VR titles and towards a fuller FPS experience, built from the ground up for room-scale Virtual Reality. The trade off is that this game may not be suited to players who are still coming to grips with VR.<br><br><strong>How far through development are you?</strong><br>Not very! This is a pre-alpha demo of the first of many levels. I plan to include a wide range of maps, enemies, weapons, and abilities eventually.<br><br><strong>Who are the developers?</strong><br>Just me! This is a passion project; I'm having great fun working on COMPOUND in my spare time.<br><br><strong>Can I help?</strong><br>Yes, please! As I mentioned, I am developing this game by myself. I need the feedback of the community to help me find bugs and balance gameplay. If you have any suggestions or find a bug that isn't in the list of known-bugs, please drop by the forums and let me know. <br><br><strong>Cool music!</strong><br>I know! But I can't take the credit for it; the music for COMPOUND was donated to me by the handsome and talented SPEEDBLACK. Check him out on Soundcloud!<br><br><strong>This game is too hard!</strong><br>Rogue-like(lite) games are supposed to be hard! But don't give up - you'll get better with every (doomed) run. Eventually you'll master the game and its systems and feel like a pro. If you are still getting frustrated, try playing on easy mode. <br><br><strong>This game makes me feel sick...</strong><br>Unfortunately the feeling of motion sickness just doesn't go away for some people. But that's fine! COMPOUND should be perfectly playable using only teleportation. Also, there are more comfort options in the works that will prevent any possible form of artificial locomotion to the player.",
