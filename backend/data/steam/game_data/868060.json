    "description": "Immortal Darkness: Curse of the Pale King is a dark fantasy dungeon crawler, that blends the best of old school dungeon crawlers with modern graphics, slick combat, and context driven audio. It features challenging real-time tactical combat, a wide variety of spells, and a dark and brooding dungeon full of lethal enemies, sadistic traps, and mind-bending puzzles. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/868060/extras/119690d28599a6244f1de4882b1e1ce3.poster.avif?t=1571685555\" width=620 height=280 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/868060/extras/119690d28599a6244f1de4882b1e1ce3.webm?t=1571685555\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/868060/extras/119690d28599a6244f1de4882b1e1ce3.mp4?t=1571685555\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>The world of Uuld is under siege by the Vampyr who have destroyed and devoured all but a few remaining strongholds of civilization. The world's last hope, Shade, an ancient and legendary vampire hunter, has been bitten in the last epic battle on the surface. <br><br>You play as Shade now struggling against the vampiric curse, using it to heal yourself but at a terrible price. You must fight your way through a twisted labyrinth of horror and death to finally face the Pale King, lord of all Vampires, before succumbing to the vampiric curse yourself.<br><br><strong>Fools Rush In</strong><br><br>This is a game that will challenge you to think tactically about every situation. Rushing into a room without a good plan will most likely get you killed very quickly. Control the flow of combat by using spells and potions to slow, stun, confuse, poison, scatter, separate and take out your enemies a few at a time.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/868060/extras/3f9d1b55a9eca5d64067847fe908db2b.poster.avif?t=1571685555\" width=620 height=300 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/868060/extras/3f9d1b55a9eca5d64067847fe908db2b.webm?t=1571685555\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/868060/extras/3f9d1b55a9eca5d64067847fe908db2b.mp4?t=1571685555\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>The Thirst</strong><br><br>As a half-vampire your primary means of healing is drinking the blood of your fallen enemies. Using this ability pushes you closer and closer to full vampire. Use it sparingly or pay the price. There are ways to reduce your build-up of evil, such as potions and holy altars, but they are few and your enemies are many.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/868060/extras/babd5dd78ac14b3e7235cbe12edce6b6.poster.avif?t=1571685555\" width=680 height=280 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/868060/extras/babd5dd78ac14b3e7235cbe12edce6b6.webm?t=1571685555\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/868060/extras/babd5dd78ac14b3e7235cbe12edce6b6.mp4?t=1571685555\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Items are Everything</strong><br><br>With the exception of your basic melee attack, every spell and ability you will have is based on the items you choose to equip to the 6 slots in your action bar.
