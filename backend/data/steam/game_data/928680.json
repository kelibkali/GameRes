    "description": "The main character, a highschool student who lives in a dorm, plans with his friends to order a fried chicken and get delivered. By losing a game of rock-scissors-paper, our main character has to order and deliver it back to the dorm. Would he be able to get back with his chicken safely?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game &quot;Chicken in the darkness&quot; is  a roguelike-indie-horror game developed by 3 highschool students. The goal is to search around the whole school to get objectives done and soundly return to eat a fried chicken with his friends.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnlike other usual horror games, there are no save points which make the game challenging. Also, trying to clear hidden achievements with a variety of limits would be very hard. Can YOU clear this game 100%?",
