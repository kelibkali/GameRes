    "description": "Space is home to a multitude of epic events and cosmic phenomena. Even the mightiest of starships seem insignificant in the face of Supernovas, Black Holes and Comets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvents are a new type of card for your Trade Deck. Each Event card has a potentially game changing effect as soon as the card enters the Trade Row. After it has its effect, it immediately gets replaced with the next card in the Trade Deck.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis expansion contains 12 cards: 1 Black Hole, 1 Bombardment, 2 Comets, 1 Galactic Summit, 2 Quasar, 1 Supernova, 2 Trade Missions and 2 Warp Jumps. Use these cards in online play, versus the AI or a friend, or in the 6th chapter of the campaign.",
