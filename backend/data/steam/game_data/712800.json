    "description": "Built from the ground up for VR, Krieg is a team-based fantasy multiplayer competitive game.<br />\r\nThrown into the middle of a war between The King's Army and The Ancients, only the strongest will survive. This war of epic mercenaries and guardians will decide the fate of the realm. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA major component unique to Krieg is the various character specific movement abilities. Krieg utilizes 3-dimensional space in a way no other VR competitive multiplayer has before. <br />\r\nArtificial locomotion has the ability to bring the most competitive experience possible for VR only titles. We fully embraced this and understand this might not be for everyone. Because of this Krieg will always have a free demo so there's no risk to try it. <br />\r\n  <br />\r\nThe release only marks the beginning. Our focus is to build a community around the game by taking as much feedback as possible and implementing changes directly suggested from the players. We're confident we have made a very exciting and engaging game as our initial release but we are just as excited for the future to help define what a VR Esport can be.",
