The answer is he's a charmer</strong> - </i><br><br><i><strong>Smarter than it needs to be ... a light-hearted adventure</strong> - </i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Introduction</h2>My Ex-Boyfriend the Space Tyrant is a traditional point-and-click adventure but stands out for its gay cast and eye-catching visuals.<br><br>On the surface, the storyline is standard science fiction fare: you play as retired space captain Tycho Minogue, dragged back into active service in order to foil the nefarious plans of a powerful interplanetary tyrant who is taking his fleet from world to world, subjugating the free people of the galaxy. But there are twists! A tale of love, loss and adventure spread over three planets and several lightyears, My Ex-Boyfriend the Space Tyrant is a classic of the gay game genre.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Some Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Full length gay themed point-and-click adventure game<br></li><li>A superb blend of comedy, drama, romance and mystery<br></li><li>Artwork by award winning artist Joe Phillips<br></li><li>Over 70 scenes and 40 characters<br></li><li>Source included<br></li><li>Accessibility options for vision and hearing impaired players</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What The Fans Are Saying</h2><i><strong>Thank you for a wonderful game playing experience, and the fact that it was a 'gay game' made it ever so much more enjoyable for this gay player.</strong> - John</i><br><br><i><strong>I'd like to compliment you on the game, My Ex-boyfriend the Space Tyrant. I enjoyed the artwork, the tongue-in-cheekiness, and the sense of a campy space-adventure. It's nice to have a gay-centric game, especially since most games are heavily influenced to appeal to the straight guy-gamer.</strong> - Jason</i><br><br><i><strong>It's a whole lot of fun, as a gay guy this is the game I've wanted to play all my life!</strong> - Brian</i>",
