    "description": "Face your fear of heights! Bridge Trek provides you with a safe environment to conquer your gephyrophobia or acrophobia in virtual reality. Build your way up from the pillow padded foot bridge, to the perilous glass bridge in the sky!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA friend of mine confessed a crippling case of gephyrophobia (fear of bridges), so I created a VR “Bridge Simulator” where she could face her fears in a non-threatening virtual environment. The first bridge is only a foot off the ground and surrounded by pillows. Each bridge is increasingly more intimidating; rope bridges, bridges that cross fish-filled water, bridges made of glass. Gephyrophobic or not, it’s pretty intimidating, but you're only a glance away from the safety of your living room! Conquer those bridges!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you're a mental health professional, and you're interested in using Bridge Trek in your work, please reach out to me, I'd love to work with you!",
