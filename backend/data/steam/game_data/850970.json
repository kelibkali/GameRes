    "description": "Plunker is a short, and heavily comedy based indie VR game based on exploring for easter eggs and extremely goofy interactions with the world around you. The player investigates suspicious scenes, trying to find anything out of order. You can expect to be strung along by jokes, replayable VR minigames/puzzles with unique mechanics, and a surreal, sometimes nonsensical story. Plunker was made by one person while streaming live on Twitch.tv and also working a full 40+ hours a week for a good portion of the last three years. All of the art, all of the code, all of the ideas, all of the testing. At the end of it you've got 45~90 minutes of playtime.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/850970/extras/99e868c4483702f99c940c530a0fb1e8.avif?t=1630505569\" width=616 height=346 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Examples of Included Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>VR Parachuting<br></li><li>VR People who are mad at you<br></li><li>VR <strong>Interactive Farting Credits</strong><br></li><li>VR Grenade-Launcher style Water Balloon Turret<br></li><li>Anxiety Inducing Life or Death Minigames (in VR)<br></li><li>Playable VR Guitar<br></li><li>Overly Realistic VR <u>Bocce Ball</u><br></li><li>More!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Examples of Features Not Included</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Battle Royale<br></li><li>Light Sabers<br></li><li>Puppies<br></li><li>Punching out your monitor by standing too close and throwing a VR bocce ball while trying to develop VR bocce ball live on Twitch (you're free to roleplay, but it's not reccomended from my own personal experiences)</li></ul><br><strong>Due to the comedy and surprise/reaction based nature of Plunker, it's a fantastic game to play in front of an audience!</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/850970/extras/b6afd937eecbdc546394fd196d984e31.poster.avif?t=1630505569\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/850970/extras/b6afd937eecbdc546394fd196d984e31.webm?t=1630505569\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/850970/extras/b6afd937eecbdc546394fd196d984e31.mp4?t=1630505569\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
