    "description": "Horror, at its core, is primal. You don't need a multi-million dollar design budget or advanced realtime bullet physics to make something scary. You just have to have an idea that is raw, and the honesty to execute it.<br><br><i><strong>P.T.</strong></i> perfectly illustrates this point. It takes place entirely in one hallway. It didn't have complicated AI. There weren't a dozen characters to design and model. Hell, there weren't even that many scares. And it was absolutely terrifying. It distilled the concepts of the ill-fated <i><strong>Silent Hills</strong></i> into a dense moment of terror. It was its own compact experience, and a glimpse into something much more.<br><br>Many games have tried to imitate <i><strong>P.T.</strong></i> in content. A million spooky hallways with a trillion collectible notes. Some of these are fantastic. But what about that concept? To distill your dream project into something condensed, raw, and real?<br><br>That was the question posed to 10 brilliant creators. Make a <i><strong>P.T.</strong></i> for the horror project of your dreams. Both a game on its own, and a window into a much larger world. Make it raw. Make it real. Make it a reflection of your own fears. Make it in just 7 days.<br><br>And they did.
