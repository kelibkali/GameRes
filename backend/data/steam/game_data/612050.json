    "description": "Built as an experiment, VRIQ puts users into a room with one goal and instruction: &quot;light up all the lights&quot;. But how? Using your creative problem solving ability, you'll have to figure out as much as you can before time runs out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe test only takes 5 minutes, so if you're curious how your &quot;intelligence&quot; compares to other VR users, give it a try!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe are open-sourcing the final score data (all anonymized) so that we can build an accurate distribution, just like a normal IQ test! Check out the 3DIQ blog to see how your score compares to others'. We'll also be comparing Vive and Oculus scores for some friendly competition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote: Intelligence is a complex skill/ability. This test is merely one indicator of comparative problem solving ability in a VR scenario, so don't feel discouraged if you get a low score. You'll have a chance to redeem yourself in future tests, and each test you take will help hone your problem solving skills!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreated by:<br />\r\nSky Nite<br />\r\nMichael Carney<br />\r\nKen Richlin",
