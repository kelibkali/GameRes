    "description": "See how sounds and shapes help mental health in virtual reality. The aim of Binaural Odyssey is to create and guide the user’s emotions. The virtual world reacts to the eyes of the viewer and creates visual shapes from whichever direction the user looks at. The project shows the potential of new technologies as an art form. The mechanisms of action of binaural sounds, colors, and patterns are based on a scientific basis.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHelp us develop experience by answering the survey of University of Tampere faculty of interactive technology on how Binaural Odyssey relaxed you and eased your stress. A link to survey can be found under &quot;Visit the website&quot;.",
