As Kid Baby's sworn protector it's up to you to deliver the universe from certain destruction.<br><br><br>Our game was crafted by a core team of just three developers. The game uses a custom engine and toolset built from the ground up to support our dream of developing a quality 3D platforming experience. As a result of these efforts we've put together a game that stands out in both visual style and quality of gameplay.
