    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >In an effort to win some money, you decide to explore a once magnificent movie studio that vanished into thin air a few years back. After a terrible fall, you find yourself trapped in a flipped, alternate dimension where unearthly creatures do everything in their power to ensure your demise.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What to Expect:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This game contains a variety of gameplay styles, art styles, and bosses. From exploring an abandoned building haunted by stalking ghosts to parkouring through a foggy cave, the main game is split into different lands, each with its own bosses and mechanics. Your choices matter in this world, the world watches you and learns from you, doing its best to give you the spookiest and most fun experience.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This world is packed with unique creatures, thrilling experiences, and many spooky moments! Experience a blend between reality and the unknown. You aren't alone and everyone (and everything) here knows that...</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Only 2/5 acts have been released. More on the way!</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About The Acts:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Act 0 is an introduction to the game and is included for free in the base game. You'll meet the protagonist and be introduced to the world.  It is a shorter act, but important nonetheless. Act 0 takes about 10-30 minutes to play. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Act 1 starts off slowly as you wonder through the remains of Rotnic... everything frozen in time... At some point, you'll be warped into the flipped dimension where the action picks up. Here, you'll encounter many bosses and your decisions will change how the dimension percieves you... so be careful. Act 1 takes about 2-5 hours to play. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Act 2 - In Development</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Act 3 - Not Released </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Act X - Not Released </p>",
