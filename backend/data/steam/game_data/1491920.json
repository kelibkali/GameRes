Witches, werewolves, and the undead are amongst those needing to be purged from these blighted lands, however, they are not the only ones. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRecent rumours have emerged about a powerful artefact, a book, which embodies corruption and chaos like no other. As one of the Guild's agents, you have been assigned to find out more about this book and to subsequently destroy it. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Guildmaster declares &quot;no consequence&quot; for this assignment. Do what must be done lest humanity falls into eternal oblivion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Navigate along dejected paths as you seek clues to completing your assignment.<br />\r\n- Combat sinister fiends to become stronger and deliver your dominance unto those who hinder your progress. <br />\r\n- Locate and use items to traverse terrain, breach barriers, fight monsters, and unearth treasures.",
