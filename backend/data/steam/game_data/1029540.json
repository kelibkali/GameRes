While online features may appear in the future, Super Kittens is designed to be <strong>fully playable offline</strong>, making it perfect for Steam Deck and on-the-go gaming (including airplane mode).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You also have a <strong>computer terminal</strong> where you can view your kitten and interact with in-game systems. All upgrades and purchases use <strong>in-game currency only</strong>, earned through gameplay – no real-world payment pressure inside the universe.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Your powers include:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Cuteness Bombs</strong> – Stop enemies and heal you</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Cuteness Bar</strong> – Weakens enemies and regenerates over time</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Cuteness Potions</strong> – Boost regeneration speed</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Cuteness Machine</strong> – Create bombs, potions, and upgrade your cuteness speed using your own cuteness energy</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You can customise your kitten through the character customisation menu.<br>A <strong>fuel bar</strong> lets you travel to different locations, while the <strong>control panel</strong> maps out the universe and its planets.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Super Kittens is also the reflection of my personal journey of learning to program and create games in my own way.
