Blast through the future to save the Near Present!  Seek out and Destroy the runaway Technology that threatens to ruin Planet Earth.  A player’s skills and smarts are tested in level after level of boss ‘Star Castles’, asteroid showers, and expert AI opponents.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is based in Earth's orbit, where you assemble a ship from various types of 'Pod' (Engines, Weapons, SolarPanels etc) - and attempt to destroy your opponent's ships. But beware, your opponents are never far away, doing all they can to break your ship apart, take your Pods and destroy you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAction is non-stop! Easy to play and simple to learn, but not so easy to master.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuild your own spacecraft from component pods.<br />\r\nOrbit around a realistic planet Earth.<br />\r\nUnique 3D cockpit user-interface.<br />\r\nRescue captured human prisoners.<br />\r\nDestroy your opponents with 6 different types of weapons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFight for supremacy in 4 different gameplay modes (Arcade, Rescue, King, and Deathmatch - Co-op or Competitive modes for all gameplay types).<br />\r\nPlay cooperatively to defeat evil robots and the Starcastles they protect.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTravel through time and unlock technology from the future!",
