It features 2 alternate starts which involve late game mechanics.</h2><br><br>In the &quot;Ashes&quot; DLC - your alternate play through of Void Destroyer 2 will give you control over - The Forge. A base of unknown origin and faction capable of manufacturing advanced ships.<br><br>As it's new &quot;owner&quot; you'll have an immediate foot hold in the sector and as you gain power you will be rewarded with the ability to build bigger and more advanced ships.<br><br>Each ship is an experiment with powerful and unique weapons, that tend to have a down side, requiring strategy to use them fully.  Larger Ashen ships come equipped with energy barriers similar to Outsider technology. However unlike Outsider tech, Ashen energy barriers will deplete and not be functional until recharged (during Overworld mode).<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1383180/extras/53c676695681717877b17248c588b2fa.poster.avif?t=1599588892\" width=640 height=480 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1383180/extras/53c676695681717877b17248c588b2fa.webm?t=1599588892\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1383180/extras/53c676695681717877b17248c588b2fa.mp4?t=1599588892\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>--<br><br><br>The Ashes DLC expands the Void Destroyer 2 ship line up with additional ships -<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Archon - a dreadnought with a devastating concussive blast.
