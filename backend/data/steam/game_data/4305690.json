    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Pee Off The Poo</strong> brings a game that’s been around since the dawn of the toilet to your screen so that you can play even when your bladder is empty.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What Is It?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You know what you've got to do. You've got to pee, pee off the poo!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Use your pee to destroy the poo in the toilet bowl, just like you've done a thousand times before. The poo builds contamination as it ages. Don't let it fill the contamination meter!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Any amateur can shoot pee at poo, but the real pros know you have to aim for the right poo in the right place. Destroy different poo shapes in a row to trigger  combos with explosions that do damage in an area. Bigger combos = bigger explosions.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Improve your poo blasting with power ups like Magnet Pee, Fire Pee, or even tag in a friend! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Finally, a game about something everyone does but nobody talks about. It's somehow a first-person shooter and a life sim. Just remember: you're not just playing a game. You're fulfilling your duty to society.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Is this a joke?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >YES! But also no. It's also the  best way to practice cleaning the toilet with your pee when your bladder is empty.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Art</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Almost all of the art in the game was hand drawn with a few UI exceptions. None of the assets in the game were created using AI.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What else?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This game idea came to me one day while doing this exact activity and I knew I had to make it. It was inspired by games like Shower With Your Dad Simulator, and I hope it brings you a few laughs and some good times.</p>",
