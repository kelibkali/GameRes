Swap between her Chain and Blade stances for long reach or quick strikes! A master Reina player knows how to manipulate her two movesets to dominate the battlefield. Harness her dark arts by teleporting to thrown knives to reposition or get that next hit.

Now you can! Afigalu is what we call a &quot;Tag-Team'' fighter, meaning you control one of them at a time, while the other sits dormant. One soul, two bodies! Swap between them to volley your opponents from yourself to... yourself! Or pick up and throw the dormant one, only to swap to them midair! If you like managing two positions at once and setting up deadly mixups, Afi &amp; Galu (Afigalu) is for you!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1376070/extras/d744a47873079f0fdaf1d28c71b9888e.avif?t=1721020181\" width=616 height=218 /></span><br><br><strong>Style - Zoner</strong><br><br>This intergalactic bounty hunter takes pride in his sharpshooting skills, boasting a wide array of projectiles to control space and snipe weak spots.

When doing so, he emits a signature red glow, allowing him to control the ground with rising spikes, drift through the air with ease, or literally just explode!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1376070/extras/6d2aef7e8fe0bb50c7952b00a2c44b95.avif?t=1721020181\" width=616 height=218 /></span><br><br><strong>Style - Grappler</strong><br><br>She says it herself...
