    "description": "The debating chamber, where the New Zealand House of Representatives sits to debate bills and consider parliamentary business, is at the heart of Parliament House. The green leather seats, thick green carpet, and immaculate rimu panels are signature features of the chamber, one of the most iconic rooms in New Zealand.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nBuilt 100 years ago in 1918, the chamber has served, and continues to serve, as the main meeting place of New Zealand’s parliamentarians.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nThrough the use of Photogrammetry, 3D scanning and Virtual Reality, the Virtual Debating Chamber (VDC) experience provides a guided digital tour of the chamber. Visitors, students, scholars and researchers will be able to view the chamber up close and personal at any time. VDC also digitally preserves this chamber for future generations.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nJoin us on an educational experience like we have never had before into one of Aotearoa's most treasured and important historical buildings.",
