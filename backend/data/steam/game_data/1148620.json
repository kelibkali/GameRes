    "description": "<strong>Adventure Awaits!</strong><br><br>Set sail on the seas of Plunder, a massive open world packed with frightening beasts, quirky quests, dreadful pirates, and the dominating force of the British Military that you may either choose to join or destroy.  With a straight-forward reputation system and action-based decision making, you will decide your fate as a Pirate Legend through quests, battles, and exploration.<br><br><strong>Endless Options!</strong><br><br>Become your own kind of captain.  Will you live as a hulking, armor-covered brute cutting down everyone in your way?  A cloaked pirate wizard bringing lightning storms down onto enemy ships?  A quick sharpshooter taking out enemies from afar before they even get the chance to see you?  Or even a modest fisherman who yearns to see new lands but wishes to stay neutral in the faces of conflict?  The quick-to-learn RPG system of Plunder will let you decide.<br><br><strong>Explore!</strong><br><br>Explore seemingly endless amounts of diverse, handcrafted environments.  You will adventure through tropical islands, deep caverns, snowy cliffs, grassy forests, deadly swamps, dark dungeons, and much more.  Be warned, however, that deadly creatures may reside in these areas and want nothing more than to tear you limb from limb.  They are most common in the dungeons beneath the surface, which are fraught with puzzles, traps, but, most importantly, treasure! <br>Sail to over 10 towns ranging from modest fishing villages to large bustling cities, each with unique personalities, quests, and allegiances (that you may change). <br>Raid them, liberate them, protect them, or even build one from the ground up; the choice is yours.<br><br><strong>Man the Cannons!</strong><br><br>Engage in real-time naval combat against ships of varying sizes.  Fire your port and starboard cannons, or ram their broadside if you're feeling extra aggressive.  Board their vessel, kill their crew, and rob them for all they're worth!  Use the fast and maneuverable Sloop, the sturdy and balanced Brigantine, or the cannon-heavy Galleon!<br><br><strong>A Legendary Tale!</strong><br><br>So what say ye?  Will you fight with the law and rid the world of pirate savagery or will you bask in it and reap the rewards?  A tale is ready to be told, dear captain, but it is your job to tell it.",
