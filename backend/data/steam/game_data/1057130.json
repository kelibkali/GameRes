    "description": "Lift off into the cosmos in this stunning immersive 3D VR music video. Exogen takes you on a futuristic journey into space with mesmerizing visuals of evolving sacred geometric patterns and a sense of weightlessness as you fly through the stars, all choreographed to original music and the unique visual style of Axon Genesis.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExogen is a single-player, first person experience, lasting under 5 minutes. A VR headset is recommended for full immersion, but is not required to simply watch it onscreen. Players can optionally use a gamepad, VR controller, or the mouse and keyboard to look around in all directions and control playback with the ability to pause and go back and forward.",
