Having signed up as guards, the heroes are about to<br>take part in a journey from the relative safety of the lands around Hellfrost Keep,<br>home of the Hearth Knights, to the distant Saxa steads nestled in the forlorn Icebarrier<br>Mountains.<br>Together the characters and the small band of heavily-armed frost dwarves travelling<br>with the caravan must weather goblin attacks, for the fell creatures have stirred<br>early this year and seem keen to make their presence felt.<br>It becomes clear the goblins are not acting alone. Something more powerful is behind<br>their attacks, something with grander plans than a few raids.<br><i>Shadow of Darkness</i> can be played as a standalone adventure or as part one<br>of a four-part mini-campaign arc.<br><strong>Requires the Hellfrost Players Guide</strong><br><strong>Requires: </strong>The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software, the Savage Worlds v3<br>Ruleset and the Hellfrost Player's Guide<br><strong>Fantasy Grounds II Conversion:</strong> Kevin Doswell<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Kevin Doswell</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
