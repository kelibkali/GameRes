Her fate changes after coming into contact with the Magicians, half-immortal beings who watch over the MO worlds. Interacting with them, the mystery of the MO worlds' origins will come to light.<br><br>Don't be deceived by the lighthearted parts--despite the fun fantasy setting, MO isn't a world that will let you survive with something as flimsy as &quot;the power of friendship.&quot;<br><br>This is a story written to make you both laugh and cry.
