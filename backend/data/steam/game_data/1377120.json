Now you have to put it back together using nothing but <strong>sound</strong>, colors are purely decorative. You can listen to any pieces as many times as you want, take your time there is no pressure :)<br><br>If you made mistake game will tell you how many, but wont show you the place :)<br>Post game you have some stats: time taken, all time best, number of times you listened to a piece.<br><br>There are <strong>7 tracks</strong> included with the game, kindly provided by various artists, this will let you checkout the game. But main focus is that you will bring your own music library. After all this is <strong>Your Music</strong> Puzzle.<br><br>Your game experience is highly dependent on music you choose. If its some hardcore <strong>Dubstep</strong>, then you will be in for 10-15 minutes of brain melting frenzy putting together a drop from barely differentiable pieces. If its <strong>calm, vocal</strong> focused song, then you are about to dive in into 30 minutes of relaxation and meditation :)<br><br>I originally made this game for myself and so far been playing it for almost a full year. It gives me unique experience of seeing my favorite songs from a new side. I often caught myself discovering new background sounds and instruments in tracks I listened to a hundred times.<br><br><strong>Game features sofar:</strong><br>- support for music in mp3/flac/opus/wav formats<br>- 7 tracks/songs included with the game<br>- local leaderboards<br>- visual effects that react to music",
