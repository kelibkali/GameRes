In Soliterix you play the solitaire game in a different way: the cards are now blocks and you have a short time to place them until they get into the floor.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1467200/extras/7cd8bb9383aa7b8b724b730c3dbc22bc.webp?t=1647183687\" width=600 height=60 /></span><br><br>Still the same rules: build entire decks from A to K. But with a different approach, looks and concept.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1467200/extras/c8cd8713f06fe9f78037b854b8f86aec.webp?t=1647183687\" width=600 height=60 /></span><br><br>Instead of regular cards here you have blocks with the cards value and suit on it. The blocks will constantly fall and you have to control where they are placed to form the sequence. You saw that before, right?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1467200/extras/c2c7ca8ac2edcec89775989d1851c146.poster.avif?t=1647183687\" width=600 height=152 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1467200/extras/c2c7ca8ac2edcec89775989d1851c146.webm?t=1647183687\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1467200/extras/c2c7ca8ac2edcec89775989d1851c146.mp4?t=1647183687\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1467200/extras/ac0e7c4b6dfc1d5fc1c2ba22a9898512.webp?t=1647183687\" width=600 height=60 /></span><br><br>Useless on almost all the card games, here the Joker block will help you: drop that over a block and the block you be drawn back!
