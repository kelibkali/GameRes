    "description": "<strong>One Late Night: Deadline</strong> continues the story of <i>One Late Night</i>, a horror/mystery game where you play the role of an office worker caught in the middle of the paranormal activity that has broken out in a seemingly ordinary office building. Freely explore the 5 story office complex that houses several different companies. Look for clues around the offices, read newspapers about local events, hack your colleagues emails – anything that might tell you something related to the strange happenings.<br><br>You arrive at your work late in the night. The rain is pouring down and a storm is closing in fast. Everyone has gone home for the day a long time ago, but the lights in the lobby are still on as usual. As you enter the office complex through the main entrance, you immediately feel the emptiness and begin to go over in your head “what the hell you are doing here in the middle of the night?”, when you could be at home getting some well-deserved sleep. However, while your mind is clouded with the details of your precious deadline, you are unaware of lurking danger in the building and what has occurred during the night. Something has been set free; something that’s not from the world of the living. The shadowy and long hallways beckon you as you attempt to unravel the mystery that has befallen the unassuming offices. Has everyone really gone home, or is someone or <i>something</i> still here?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Facts</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u><strong>Objectives</strong></u><br>The entire game revolves around completing objectives and other small tasks.
