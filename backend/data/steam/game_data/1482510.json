    "description": "Somehow it happened that the world of Tap-tap left &quot;talent&quot; for a while. And somehow it so happened that this was enough &quot;Mediocrity&quot; to plunge the world into twilight and leave it without sound. Well, what happened, what happened and now you (recommended) have to collect the lost notes at each level, and at the same time return the music to the world. The difficulty lies in the fact that it all depends on you and your ability to calculate each roll of your protagonist die. But don't worry! With the help of open &quot;notes&quot; your assortment of masks will also increase, which will help you in this difficult task of saving the world. From the side of the world, complexity is promised, tied rather to the physical properties of the hero, the properties of the surrounding world and methods, where can we go without them. On your part, I hope you can save this world .. After all, it is doomed without you!<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n- Physics of the cube. At its core, the gameplay sets the task of &quot;accurately toss the cube to the desired platform&quot;, but I don't think that you will be able to save your nerves :)<br />\r\n- There is no guarantee of the safety of your nerves!<br />\r\n- Enemies, although static, are extremely intrusive<br />\r\n- All you need is the ability to click on the mouse .. And just a little luck<br />\r\n- Your main enemy is a computer mouse. I warn you, in this game she is hateful like nothing else!<br />\r\n- Not all enemies sit still. Some even have the nerve to jump and shoot<br />\r\n- Your actions will change both the sound of the world and its brightness<br />\r\n- &quot;Tap-tap adventure&quot; is all you need to know about the 5 stages of adoption",
