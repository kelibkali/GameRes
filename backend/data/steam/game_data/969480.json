Keep the ever-expanding waves of <i>Bandits</i> approaching at bay. Your objective is to survive and collect electric energy orbs to increase your score, the longer you survive the more the game will increase the difficulty.<br><br>Use the momentum of the craft while traveling in combination with rotating steering and boosters for a detailed sense of control. You can break a single wing and survive to find a wing-fix but break both wings and your ship will explode.<br><br>The <i>Bandits</i> have unique movement patterns and behaviors and become more advanced versions of themselves if reached. If you hit an environmental obstacle like black holes it will destroy your craft at the center otherwise it pulls you in when close by.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/969480/extras/0f9cbacba40e076c8a476629e7a0b178.poster.avif?t=1549651598\" width=616 height=40 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/969480/extras/0f9cbacba40e076c8a476629e7a0b178.webm?t=1549651598\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/969480/extras/0f9cbacba40e076c8a476629e7a0b178.mp4?t=1549651598\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><strong>Warp Glider</strong> will work with a flight stick, Joystick controller, or with a keyboard and mouse. I recommend to glide with a standard Console/PC controller for the joystick but it's developed to suit whatever you're comfortable with.",
