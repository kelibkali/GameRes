    "description": "Katyusha early alpha version. We have developed a demo for our first video game. A 2D Platform/RPG based on the popular Russian song/character. In this early build you can browse the following:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n– Freedom in gameplay: Play either full action or going stealth by hiding from your enemies. Stealth attacks allow you to hit with critical damage once the stealth bar overpasses 50%.<br />\r\n– A.I.: Enemies have an improved A.I. Wild animals, which will occur only during the first level of the game, need you to stand still and hit them, while enemy soldiers require that you either time your shots or hit and run when using melee.<br />\r\n– Historical facts: Meet real-life people from World War II and learn historical facts that occured in the Soviet Union. They will train you and they will show you how to survive in battle.<br />\r\n– Checkpoints: Find real-life World War II letters from both Russian and German soldiers. Use them wisely in checkpoints in order to save your progress.<br />\r\n– Levelling system: Katyusha levels up and spends attribute points in Strength, Dexterity, Vitality and Intelligence. Strength increases her melee attacks. Dexterity increases ranged attacks. Vitality increases the health bar and finally Intelligence gives boost to the eagle (mentioned below).<br />\r\n– Emotional: Communicate with NPCs and live emotional moments, while also discovering easter eggs as well. <br />\r\n– Eagle: Use your pet to attack enemies. It levels up as well, while at the same time it has a cooldown for every usage.<br />\r\n– Crafting: You can use cotton, leather, iron and other materials that you encounter in order to craft armor and items that will assist you in battle.<br />\r\n– Boss fights: Encounter bosses from World War II and face them into immersive battles (not available in early alpha).<br />\r\n– Trading: Loot enemy corpses and trade the items in NPCs (not available in early alpha).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you like our free demo then stay tuned for our Kickstarter campaign.",
