In Smash Up, players draft two faction decks from their choice of pirates, ninjas, robots, zombies, and more, and combine them to create an unstoppable deck!<br><br>Your goal is to conquer bases, while stopping your opponents from doing the same. Each faction has distinct abilities and ways of playing, meaning that Wizards and Robots will aim to conquer bases in a different way that Wizards and Ninjas would!<br><br>Can your alliance be the first to smash your way to 15 points and win the game?!<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/446540/extras/27d16104c3a5a27b12819e35bf9d99d8.avif?t=1760518660\" width=616 height=228 /></span><br><br><strong>Aliens</strong> love to mess with people and move things around. You may see your minions jumping back into your hand or the bases in play being replaced with a new one… After all it’s not their planet they’re messing with!<br><br><strong>Dinosaurs</strong> are huge. And have an enormous amount of power. Plus someone gave them lasers… Who gave them lasers?! They’re not a force to be reckoned with! If you want powerful minions in your alliance, the dinosaurs are the way to go. <br><br><strong>Geeks</strong> are, well… Geeks! Slightly eccentric individuals with intellectual pursuits! They can also be thoughtful and tricky! You may also spot a couple of famous Geeks’ in there, so keep your nerdy eyes peeled! <br><br>If you’re sneaky and fast, the <strong>Ninjas</strong> faction is probably the right one for you. Without ever being seen, Ninjas are the ones who focus on destroying your opponents minions and can pull out sly and surprising moves! <br><br>Swashbuckle your way into every base on the board. <strong>Pirates</strong> aren’t known for their pleasantries, and in Smash Up they’re no different. If your opponent has a minion on a base, walk over there and tell that landlubber to walk the plank.<br><br>We all knew it was only a matter of time before the <strong>Robots</strong> learnt how to do things better than us… and they’re looking to terminate! They’ve learnt how to churn out highly specialized bots that can overwhelm your opponent quickly in a single turn! <br><br><strong>Tricksters</strong> steal things, hide things, swap things and who knows what else! The best thing though? They can stop your opponents things. Make your opponents regret doing things altogether!<br><br>Alakazam! <strong>Wizards</strong>, as you may expect, can conjure whatever they need. Drawing extra cards and playing them in the same turn is what makes these wizards the conjuring experts we all know and love. <br><br>They’re coming to get you... <strong>Zombies</strong> just keep coming back! Discard piles mean nothing if you have the Zombies on your side, as nothing stops the undead! This alliance will allow you to utilise your discard pile, so it’s never “Goodbye” just “See you later!”<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/446540/extras/6d0653479313d1d0dadf7201617093d3.avif?t=1760518660\" width=616 height=208 /></span><br><br>Once you’ve chosen your faction, it’s time to smash them together!<br><br>When you play, random Base cards will be available to battle over. Tactically deploy your minions in order to stake your claim on the different bases available, and stop your opponents from doing the same!
