    "description": "“I can give you that which you desire most. Your humanity.” This was all that was promised to Callum Röttwell in the mysterious email he received out of the blue one day. It was enough though for him to uproot his life and travel to the city of Starhaven to start anew. As an angel from a small town, he has to adapt quickly and learn how to interact with those he's never encountered before- demons. Especially since he must share a bedroom with one in a cramped apartment. Throughout this journey, Callum will meet many characters, explore the city of Starhaven, and dive deeper into what that strange email entails for him. But he must be wary, for his goddess is watching closely.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Dialogue and exploration based RPG gameplay<br />\r\n-Engaging and original story<br />\r\n-Pixel artstyle<br />\r\n-Original soundtrack <br />\r\n-Many characters to meet and talk to<br />\r\n-Two different endings to get <br />\r\n-Many puzzles and minigames to do<br />\r\n <br />\r\nBaked with love by Team Meatpie",
