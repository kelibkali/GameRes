    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >  Referee's Briefing 3: Going Portside</h2>Travellers pass through many starports in their wanderings, and after a while these places can begin to blur into one another. The endless procession of generic bars and hotels, the same shops and tired old d?cor can be soul-destroying. But it does not have to be like that! Referee's Briefing 3: Going Portside presents a miscellany of things to do and places to visit that are both interesting and memorable. Not always for the most positive of reasons but then, you can't have everything...<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong></strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Traveller 2E (Mongoose) ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
