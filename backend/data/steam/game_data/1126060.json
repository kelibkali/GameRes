The organizers put our character in an emergency bunker and made all possible exits inaccessible. The &quot;icing on the cake&quot; is that all rooms are filled with poisonous gas every second, which will slowly lead to death if you sit in one place. And now the player is faced with the task of finding a way to get out of this bunker.</p>",
