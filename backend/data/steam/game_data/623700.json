    "description": "Rec Center Tycoon draws inspiration from the simulation/management classics like Theme Hospital as well as modern classics like Prison Architect to give you a deep, challenging business management game where you build and run a recreation center from the ground up.<br>Micromanage employees, finances, fitness classes, customer needs and much more!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/623700/extras/79b6eeb7538c9277d23179e378aae56e.avif?t=1654199733\" width=615 height=393 /></span><br><br>Start small, building a nice inviting, chill gym.<br>Hire employees, decide their wages &amp; choose their work hours. Maybe take out a bank loan.<br>As you progress through the research tree you'll unlock new equipment, facilities &amp; much more.<br>Work your way up to building a giant, bustling Rec Center with hundreds of members, running fitness classes like aerobics &amp; swimming. All taught by your team of fitness instructors.<br>Hire lifeguards &amp; nurses to keep your customers safe. Keep your plants watered, bins empty &amp; cafe full of food &amp; you're on your way to success!<br><br>Here's just a sample of some features you may enjoy:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Challenging gameplay; unlike many other management/simulation games, failure is a possibility in Rec Center Tycoon. You must keep your customers happy or they may leave negative reviews which can hurt future business leading to poor profits.<br></li><li>Large selection of buy-able exercise equipment to keep customers satisfied.<br></li><li>Many different employees types, from your simple receptionist to a boxing trainer.<br></li><li>Every employee has different motivations, skill levels &amp; traits. Some employees may prefer short 5 hour shifts, others are happy to work 12 hour shifts. An unfit, yet charismatic employee won't make a good lifeguard, but they might make a great receptionist.<br>It's up to you to choose the right employee for the job!<br></li><li>Hire fitness instructors &amp; create your own fitness classes.<br></li><li>Host customer parties in your Event Rooms for an added source of income.<br></li><li>Build a café &amp; hire a barista. You'll need a few cooks to keep the cafe stocked and do catering for any events you may be hosting.<br></li><li>Create your own manager who is always on-site &amp; can perform various duties to help out &amp; keep things running smoothly.<br></li><li>Take control of your manager &amp; manually walk around and do a variety of tasks yourself!<br></li><li>Hire a nurse &amp; build an infirmary for the inevitable accidents that come from customers swimming &amp; using all kinds of heavy gym equipment.<br></li><li>Running low on money? Take out a loan from the bank! Beware of the interest rates though.<br></li><li>Complex financial system. Do you charge a flat rate for entry? Or make entry free but dramatically increase the cost of amenities like café food and arcade machines? Do you lock facilities like swimming behind a membership?  What will your daily membership costs be?</li></ul><br>And there's a whole lot more to come!<br><br><br>For the moment Rec Center Tycoon is only available for the Windows platform with possibilities for Mac &amp; Linux support added after.",
