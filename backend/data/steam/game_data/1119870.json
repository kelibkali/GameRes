    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Bot Land has been discontinued</h2><br>I discontinued Bot Land as of February, 2020. The game is still online and playable. I removed real-money payments, so the game is 100% free.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Original introduction</h2><br>Do you like strategy games? Are you a regular human who still hasn't figured out how to move at the speed of light? Then oh boy is Bot Land the game for you!<br><br>In Bot Land, all of your bots follow <strong>scripts</strong> (so you can snap your controller in half for all we care). You'll tell your bots how to perform actions <i>ahead of time</i>, that way they don't need a lousy human to control them mid-battle. This allows your bots to fight even while you're offline; they'll protect your CPU against other players' attacks.<br><br>Now, let's be honest... you're a great gamer—that's why you're reading this description—but even <i>you</i> might still lose a match or two. That's where replays come in handy. Maybe your opponent cloaked, bypassed your bots, and destroyed your CPU while your own bots were busy calculating prime numbers with a billion digits. You can use that information to improve for next time.<br><br>Then, after improving your defense, you can attack other players' CPUs in the same way. Maybe you've got a killer strategy involving <strong>LANDMINES</strong> or <strong>TELEPORTATION</strong> or <strong>OTHER BOLDED WORDS</strong>, the likes of which no one has ever <i>seen</i> before. You finally find the perfect chump on which to unleash this onslaught. They've got measly bots with <strong>artillery</strong> and <strong>shields</strong>, so you teleport behind them, misquote a meme, and punch them in their shiny metal backs. You're the top dog-bot now.<br><br>And when you win...? Oh, don't even get us started. You'll earn <strong>Botcoin</strong>, which, through a myriad of steps, roughly translates to <strong>fame and fortune</strong> in real life (the steps are really just a sense of satisfaction and a profound feeling of &quot;the courage was within me the entire time!&quot;; Botcoin isn't a cryptocurrency). You'll buy new items, make new strategies, teach a wasp bot how to love, ponder whether we're all just living in a simulation, and then look up how to remove wasp-bot stingers from your arm. It's great fun.<br><br>Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fully automate battles—no APM needed<br></li><li>Create scripts visually (with Blockly) or via code<br></li><li>Test scripts before attacking other players<br></li><li>Learn through several tutorials<br></li><li>Play both sides of the battle: attacking and defending<br></li><li>Watch replays to improve your defense<br></li><li>Start revenge battles against players who’ve attacked you<br></li><li>Improve your ranking by winning matches<br></li><li>Customize your bots’ appearances—create any combination of head, torso, and foot items<br></li><li>Earn Botcoin through daily missions<br></li><li>Create an avatar to represent yourself to other players<br></li><li>Share your defense with other players with a direct link<br></li><li>All versions of Bot Land are compatible for cross-platform play</li></ul>",
