    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > The Threefold Conspiracy AP 3: Deceivers' Moon</h2>On their voyage through space back to the Pact Worlds, the heroes and their new Stewards allies begin to realize disturbing gaps in their recent memory, missing moments of lost time replaced with dreamlike impressions of imprisonment, surgery, and shadows. A Stewards base on a fiery moon of the gas giant Bretheda seems to offer respite from paranoia and pursuit, but unseen enemies lurk even in the heart of the system's most powerful institutions, and the web of alien conspiracy enshrouds all of the Pact Worlds!<br>&quot;Deceivers' Moon&quot; is a Starfinder Roleplaying Game adventure for four 5th-level characters.
