Players move through unsettling environments where reality feels unstable, uncovering clues that blur the line between what is remembered and what is imagined.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The experience focuses on tension and unease rather than combat or constant threats.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Exploration-Driven Horror</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Gameplay emphasizes slow exploration and observation. Progress comes from navigating environments, discovering subtle changes, and piecing together meaning from visual and environmental cues.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >There are no reflex-heavy mechanics — the horror emerges from atmosphere, uncertainty, and psychological pressure.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Unsettling Atmosphere and Immersion</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Paramnesia relies heavily on sound design, lighting, and pacing to create a persistent sense of dread. The environments feel familiar yet wrong, reinforcing the game’s themes of memory distortion and psychological instability.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This is a <strong>single-player horror experience</strong> designed for players who enjoy immersive, slow-burn psychological horror.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >First-person psychological horror gameplay</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Exploration-focused progression</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Themes of memory, perception, and reality</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Unsettling atmosphere driven by sound and visuals</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >No combat — tension built through environment and pacing</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Single-player immersive horror experience</p></li></ul>",
