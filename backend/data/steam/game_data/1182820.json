    "description": "The main character is the only one who can get in the way of an inevitable man-made catastrophe. The short story tells the reader about the adventures of Pachomius and his friends. The dark side of the world of visual novels will open the door of the elevator rushing to meet the trials. The betrayal of comrades and gloomy behind-the-scenes intrigues are only the aftertaste of a beautiful shawarma, thoughts about which save the protagonist and direct him to his tomorrow. Permanent denouement is irreversible as is the fee that should be paid for each of your actions.",
