There's no boss fights<br></li><li>I have ideas for Lovely Planet 2. I also have a prototype ready<br></li><li>Look, I can't really explain why it's not a shooter game. I wanted to make a platformer, so I made a platformer. Okay?<br></li><li>You're still reading this? Pro tip - there is in fact a second jump button the game never tells you about<br></li><li>Here's the solution to level 32 - Jump straight down, hang a right and carefully crawl along the passage till you hit a left turn. From there, carefully drop to your right and go straight till you reach the end of the beam. Drop down to the platform below and follow the path to your left. You'll find an NPC there who will show you the rest of the way.<br></li><li>Don't look for the Mad Wizard in the forest, the NPCs, they're lying to you</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/588540/extras/f9555a763628d6888f2a481931774c06.avif?t=1618279716\" width=600 height=338 /></span>",
