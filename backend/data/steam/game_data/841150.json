Hordes of Chaos Daemons pour in from the rift, threatening to sweep over the Sanctus Reach system. <br>Only the Space Wolves stand tall before the chaotic tide, the last bastion of the Imperium. Should they fall the whole system will be lost and all the blood that has been spilt so far will be for nothing.<br><br>This is why they won’t relent. They will fight in the name of the Emperor with tooth and claw in a feral maelstrom, back to back with warriors of legend. This is how sagas are born, in blood and chaos.</i><br><br><br><strong>Warhammer 40,000: Sanctus Reach is back with a new expansion.</strong> You will lead the Space Wolves in the last chapter of the Sanctus Reach campaign: Logan Grimnar’s chapter will once again show its valour in a 16 scenarios single player campaign.
