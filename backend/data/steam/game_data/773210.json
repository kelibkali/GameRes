There's a 'Download Demo' button on the right side of this page.  There's also a fully functional 14-day demo on our website.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><u>Driver Delight</u> - ControlMyJoystick uses our own Tetherscript Virtual Keyboard, Joystick and Mouse drivers, which are legit, digitally signed and secure.<br><br><u>Curve It</u> - Easily create joystick and 3Dconnexion controller axis response curves, trim and dead-zones then switch between different curves by any trigger. Think separate curves for ‘cruising’ and ‘landing’.  You can even curve a joystick throttle slider.<br><br><u>Wonderful WASD</u> - Use a 3Dconnexion controller or joystick to emulate a digital joystick for scroll-around-the-map kind of games.<br><br><u>Multi-threaded Mayhem</u> - Each macro runs on it’s own thread, so you can run more than one macro simultaneously.<br><br><u>Prolific Profiles</u> - Create one or more profiles per game. Then add macros, triggers and scripts to the profile. Change profiles easily without have to restart the game or ControlMyJoystick..<br><br><u>Mmmm Macros</u> - Add macros to profiles for each command such as ‘Gear Up’ or ‘Show Map’. You can have as many as you like.<br><br><u>Terrific Triggers</u> - Use your voice, joystick, smartphone/tablet app or 3Dconnexion controller as a trigger to run a macro and it’s corresponding script. You can even embed scripts within scripts.<br><br><u>Super Scripting</u> - Create scripts to send commands to the game, switch axis curves, control external devices and other cool things. It’s point and click, so no programming knowledge is necessary.<br><br><u>Share The Fun</u> - Easily import and export your game profiles so that you can share them with other gamers.<br><br><u>Hack It</u> - If you are handy with code, you can create your own trigger sources and send notification events when a macro is run. We included UDP sender and receiver test apps so can see how it works.  We even offer the not included, but free HVDK Standard, which is a SDK for accessing the drivers yourself.<br><br><u>Windowed Wonderful...ness</u> - If you are running a game in a window, you can set it as a profile target so that each macro sends command to the game, and not your web browser, etc.<br><br><u>It's Pretty</u> - Customize ControlMyJoystick’s look and feel by choosing from over 100 themes and adjustable font sizes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Real Support and Knowledge Base</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Post your question in the Steam forums.<br></li><li>Browse the forums on our website at <br></li><li>Search the knowledge base over at </li></ul>",
