    "description": "A game all about chocolate. All you have to do is melt it and send it down the collector.<br><br>Play over 100 levels, composed of timed, moves limited, ingredient collecting and puzzle levels.<br>Use bonuses and boosters to help you get a bigger score or simply help you finish the more tricky puzzle levels.<br><br>In each level you guide molten chocolate to a collector. You do this by selecting a starting chocolate piece and connect this molten piece to another one of the same type. You can also use the <i>type bonus</i> to link a type of chocolate to another type and score bigger this way.<br><br>In order to make your life easier you also can use a <i>moves/time bonus</i> that gives you 5 more moves or 15 additional seconds.<br>The <i>random bonus</i> needs to be connected to a chocolate chain and it will remove 3 other random pieces of the same type, once it's collected.<br>And to help you most in the moments that you are stuck you have the <i>bomb bonus</i> and <i>clear bonus</i>, both of those will remove many chocolates when you collect them from the field.<br><br>In<strong> limited moves</strong> types of levels you have to reach a certain score within a limited number of moves.<br>The <strong>timed</strong> levels play similar to the limited moves levels, but you play against time.<br>For <strong>ingredient</strong> levels, you must get candies from the top of the board all the way down or in a collector.<br><strong>Puzzle</strong> levels will put your strategic thinking to the test, by having you clear jelly puddles by collecting the chocolate on top of them in a certain number of moves.<br><br>Each day you can roll the wheel for various rewards. Compete with your friends for the biggest highscore.",
