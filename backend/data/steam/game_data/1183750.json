Push it, capture it, split it, throw it.<br></li><li>Create amazing psychedelic liquids.<br></li><li>Watch the fantastic patterns as surface tension and real physics forces transmogrify these amorphous masses.<br></li><li>Watch as it collides with the walls and space station equipment.</li></ul><br>Liquid Space is a fun simple simulation experience.  Great for learning and teaching about space, or just tinkering with for fun.<br><br>In the past you could only achieve this level of interactive fluid realism using a super computer.  Now you can experience this fantastic interactivity in virtual reality like never before!<br><br>We are thinking to include something similar into a new level in our Apollo 17 Moonbuggy VR app - <br><br>There is no specific goal currently, this is just a simple sandbox for free play.  Have fun and give us some feedback and ideas for challenges with the liquids.",
