    "description": "Death Trash features a world where cosmic horrors long for humanity but meet punks with shotguns. Influenced by post-apocalyptic, horror, and cyberpunk classics but with a fresh personality of its own. Death Trash combines the crunch and depth of old-school, role-playing classics with the controls and game feel of modern games.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/941460/extras/455214488814a38f088cb281e1171a69.poster.avif?t=1750947205\" width=656 height=332 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/941460/extras/455214488814a38f088cb281e1171a69.webm?t=1750947205\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/941460/extras/455214488814a38f088cb281e1171a69.mp4?t=1750947205\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Gameplay</strong><br><br>Death Trash is an open-world, singleplayer role-playing game with handcrafted levels, a strong story campaign and optional local co-op gameplay.<br><br>The game features real-time gameplay with ranged and melee combat, stealth, multiple choice dialogue, an inventory of items and worms, a crafting system, and skills like pickpocketing and puking.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/941460/extras/949859c06a22a1d554989a0a9750913f.poster.avif?t=1750947205\" width=560 height=374 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/941460/extras/949859c06a22a1d554989a0a9750913f.webm?t=1750947205\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/941460/extras/949859c06a22a1d554989a0a9750913f.mp4?t=1750947205\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Travel through a gritty, post-apocalyptic wasteland by world map and explore hand-painted, organic locations.

But the game also contains a local co-op mode:<br><br>- Covering the full campaign. The second player can drop in and drop out anytime.<br>- Second player has their own character, stats, inventory etc. but shared quest progress.<br>- Both players are restricted to the same location and traveling on the world map happens together.<br>- Both players can perform actions separately, including dialogue, and don't interrupt each other.<br>- The game has a shared screen mode (default) and a permanent split screen mode.<br><br>We're not planning an online co-op mode due to limited development resources. We will evaluate this again in the future.<br>Steam Remote Play Together will be possible.",
