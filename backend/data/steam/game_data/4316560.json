Using dark magic and advanced technology, the enemy managed to concentrate the energy of our planet into three magical runes. For many years, these runes have served as a source of power for the &quot;Dark Lords&quot; and have kept the dimensional rift active. Until recently, there was absolutely no information about the locations of the magical runes. But today, everything has changed! The best resistance fighters have been sent on a critical mission. <br> <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4316560/extras/1c50fba7781a5c6321e3f849db8dbeb7.avif?t=1771927609\" width=800 height=491 /></span></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Max</strong> — young but seasoned commander (assault rifle / flamethrower),</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Titan</strong> — warrior from another dimension who joined humanity (assault rifle / rocket launcher),</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Alpha</strong> — electronics hacking specialist (pistol / tribolt laser). </p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4316560/extras/28caa770f2b31737bb3720e14b7d39e2.avif?t=1771927609\" width=800 height=129 /></span><i>The Rift Rebels</i> is a classic retro-styled side-scrolling arcade action game. <br>You will journey through seven chapters, each consisting of two levels and a boss battle. <br>Each level grants you three lives. If all are lost, the level must be replayed — but your chapter progress remains intact. <br>Before starting any chapter, you may choose one of three unique characters. <br>Upon completing a chapter, your progress is saved, and all its levels become permanently available from the main menu. <br>This means you can always play through the entire game from start to finish, just like in the golden age of arcades — or jump straight into any unlocked chapter. <br> <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4316560/extras/b9cd7b6a0cd7424aca7be846dbc88d56.avif?t=1771927609\" width=800 height=129 /></span> <br>The game supports multiple control schemes (you can review them in the settings menu) for keyboard and mouse, as well as controller support.  <br>Fans of retro arcade action games will feel right at home!</p>",
