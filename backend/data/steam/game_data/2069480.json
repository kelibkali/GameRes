Choose from 13 different weapons, ready your superpowers, and go through one of their hideouts to destroy them. And look out for the experimental robot. Despite being made by Mikaira, it was reprogrammed to attack him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are no heroes to rescue. No outside help. It's you VS nearly a 100 enemies. Navigate through their maze of a base, fight through the opposition, and destroy the warbot. Get in and get out. What are you waiting for? Get to it!",
