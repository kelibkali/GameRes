As you progress, you will also know more about the Moon, its craters, its seas, and the space landers that dot its surface. Finally, the 7th world of the game is dedicated to women in science (out of a total of 1600 craters named after scientists on the Moon, only 32 are women!).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Features</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Use eight space and patented technologies<br></li><li> Use an innovative self-service system developped by SPACE TOW TRUCK<br></li><li> Enjoy a replay system with slow motion effect<br></li><li> Get help from a mysterious &quot;person&quot; working at SPACE TOW TRUCK and find out why it is so motivated to help you<br></li><li> Hear Soft Music<br></li><li> Discover the Moon, its seas, its craters and the landers that dot its surface<br></li><li> Learn about the history of science and its evolution, with the last world dedicated to women in science<br></li><li> Feel, understand and learn the laws of mechanics</li></ul><br>Whatever your emergency, SPACE TOW TRUCK have the tools to get you on your way.<br> <br>Happy space travels.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1273600/extras/4a21e68dff466903da5474f573fe5373.avif?t=1728066052\" width=620 height=180 /></span>",
