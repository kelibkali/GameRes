    "description": "Brain vs Zombies is a puzzle shooter VR Game from Joy Way. Players must solve physical puzzles to kill each level’s enemies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou wake up in a room full of avocado-shaped zombies. It seems you are part of an experiment to see if you have what it takes to eliminate the zombies. The only way to stay alive is to kill them all, but you have a limited number of bullets in your gun. You’ll need to turn on your brain to make it through the increasingly complex puzzles. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe zombies do not always need to be shot directly. Instead you’ll need to calculate the rebound trajectory, blow something up, shoot at various mechanisms, push one dummy into another, open and close doors, use portals and so on",
