We tried hard to put every marine species into this aquarium. Hopefully, by watching them everyday, we bring our lives closer to nature. And at the same time, we too can imagine ourselves swimming in a clear gentle sea.

Fish operculum heave slowly with each breathing motion, and the eyeballs roll agilely like a real live fish in front of you.<br><br>They swim swiftly like floating clouds or flowing water, and they will suddenly stop and catch the food you spray out. You can also see the Palette Surgeonfish’s dorsal fin sticking up due to the decrease in the current pressure. Different kinds of fish have different swimming postures. Each of them have specialized skills, like the glowing colors of derma glossing and its detailed realistic outline model, demonstrating various lifelike traits of sea fish.<br><br>Most of all, this is not a film nor an anime. It is an eco-simulated program, a virtually created reality built with a well designed framework after extensive research into the domain.

They are the marine animals freely roaming in a marine world you have been dreaming of.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >More alive cline</h2><br>All the tropical fish in Aqua Real 2 no longer always swim around in groups. Some of them live alone, some of them swim in groups. Occasionally they even attack one another due to the basic instinct of territorial aggression. They also swim for their lives when they sense sharks lurking nearby.<br><br>Have you ever seen instant calculator anemone? In order to make coral reefs more realistic in Aqua Real 2, we have developed a realistic and efficient “anemone-clown fish cline module”. It includes a physics operation animalism module.
