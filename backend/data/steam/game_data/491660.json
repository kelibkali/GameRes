    "description": "Assault on the Necrospire is a roguelike with an emphasis on interesting loot and character building. The Necromancer has destroyed the wizard order, leaving only you alive. You must venture through the ever changing Necrospire to bring him to justice. <br><br><strong><u>Discover a wealth of loot</u></strong><br>The Necrospire is brimming with loot, granting powerful (and sometimes unusual) effects. Mythical items await those able to reach the highest floors of the Necrospire, bestowing extraordinary abilities. <br><br><strong><u>Define your build</u></strong><br>Choose how you want to fight with an inventory system that allows you to change your build on the go.<br><br><strong><u>Harness the power of magic</u></strong><br>Equip spell tomes to modify your attacks. Slow your enemies, burn them to a crisp or even freeze them in time. Up to 5 spell tomes can be equipped at once, combining their effects together. <br><br><strong><u>Up the challenge for greater rewards</u></strong><br>Enable difficulty modifiers such as double bosses and exploding enemies, making the Necrospire far more dangerous but increasing your chances of finding rarer loot.<br><br><strong><u>Equip ancient relics</u></strong><br>Use powerful relics to summon companions to your side, teleport yourself across a room, fire deadly volleys of arrows and much, much more.<br><br><strong><u>Face challenging enemies</u></strong><br>Powerful foes await you as you climb the Necrospire. Use your equipment, spells and relics to even the odds.<br><br><strong><u>A new experience each time</u></strong><br>Each journey into the Necrospire is randomly generated; no two runs will be the same.",
