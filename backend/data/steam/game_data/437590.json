    "description": "<i>Only the host needs to own this DLC. </i><br><br>1-5 Players | Ages 13 &amp; Up <br><br>Approximately 30 minutes<br><br><strong><i>Tiny Epic Galaxies</i></strong>, designed by Scott Almes, is driven by an exciting dice-rolling mechanic that rewards thoughtful programming of the results. Players control a home planet and a series of space ships within their own personal galaxy. As players upgrade their galaxies they gain access to more ships and more dice.<br><br>Each turn, a player will roll a set of dice, how many dice are rolled is determined by the level of that player’s galaxy. Each side of the die (6 sided) represents a different type of action: Movement, Colony Action, Harvest from Culture Planets, Harvest from Energy Planets, Improve an Economic Influence, Improve a Diplomatic Influence.<br><br>After the roll, the player then sorts the results of the roll (one selective re-roll is allowed) and organizes the dice in a desired activation order. Each die, in order, is then resolved and the results are immediate! This gets very exciting, as it allows the player to pull-off unseen combos and surprise other players. But don’t fret! Other players have the option to copy other player’s actions… at a cost!<br><br>In addition to upgrading galaxies, effective resource management provides luck-mitigating options that can sway the game in a calculated player’s favor.<br><br>As players expand their galaxy by colonizing other planets through economic and diplomatic influence, they gain victory points AND the special powers brought in by those planets!<br><br>You are the ruler of your galaxy and there are no limits to your expansion!",
