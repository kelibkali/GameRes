What catastrophe blighted the land and drained it of color and life? Where are the settlers and tribes who lived here? <br><br>Clue by clue, you must piece together the story of what befell this doomed settlement and find a way to set things right. You will be hunted by corrupted Conquistadors and ravening shadows as you explore an expansive wilderness in order to trace the brief, tragic history of the colony and search for survivors.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Explore large, open environments teeming with danger and discovery.
