As their patrols scoured the ruined planet's surface, they encountered unexpected resistance from the Imperial survivors.  Protected from Tallarn's toxified atmosphere in their underground shelters, the loyalists launched a spirited campaign of hit-and-run attacks on the Iron Warriors. <br><br><strong>6 Mission Resurrection Campaign</strong><br>As the Imperium learned of the Iron Warriors' treachery and the fate of the survivors of Tallarn, their relief troops and armour arrived in force, only to be matched by those of the enemy.  The Iron Warriors ground their way to Sapphire City, beneath which lay a subterranean network of tunnels and shelters which had served as a bulwark in the Imperial defence line.<br><br><strong>6 Mission Revenge Campaign</strong><br>Despite determined efforts, the Imperium were unable to shift the Iron Warriors from The Sightless Warren.  Meanwhile fighting on the surface ground to a stalemate as heavy armoured units reinforced both sides.  In a bid to sway the battle, The Iron Warriors' Macro-Transport “The Eagle's Talon” was brought into orbit around Tallarn, threateningly positioned to bring a new wave of troops to fight for the traitors.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/515980/extras/4344256759a471ae3aef0a88f938ef81.avif?t=1580974690\" width=616 height=140 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>66 different units accurately recreated<br></li><li>54 different weapons<br></li><li>Three campaigns, each of six linked missions<br></li><li>Four battle packs, each with six standalone missions<br></li><li>An eight mission tutorial campaign<br></li><li>Play all missions, other than the Tutorial, as either Imperial or Traitor forces<br></li><li>Tailor your army with custom force selection<br></li><li>Fight on the devastated surface of Tallarn or for control of the vast underground bunker system<br></li><li>8 unique unit types<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Aircraft<br></li><li>Flyers<br></li><li>Infantry<br></li><li>Tanks<br></li><li>Walkers<br></li><li>Super Heavy Walkers<br></li><li>Super Heavy Tanks<br></li><li>Titans</li></ul></li><li>Future updates will add more missions and many more units</li></ul>",
