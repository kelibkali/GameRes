    "description": "<i>Split or Steal</i> is a light re-imagining of the Game Theory concept of <i>The Prisoner's Dilemma</i>.<br><br>Two players will be selected from a pool of online users, and are presented with a potential reward. The players are given a maximum of 2 minutes to speak with eachother – at which point, they can then choose to either share, or attempt to steal the reward.<br><br>Earn an honest fortune, or steal your way to success - then spend your winnings on building a Headquarters to amplify your earnings in an idle/incremental-style fashion, running heists against those who wronged you, or just buying one of over 140 different cosmetics to show off in-game with. And, if you don't manage to alienate people by stealing from the entire planet, take advantage of the shared wealth and bonuses offered by joining an Organization!<br><br>Fully cross-play compatible with all other Web &amp; Standalone releases, inclusive of support for importing existing player profiles.",
