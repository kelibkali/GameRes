    "description": "Limouzik is a software that transform your computer into a music instrument and makes you a musician.<br><br>Limouzik is based on classical harmony and the relationship between chords of the same key (used in the famous 4 chords songs). Depending on the selected chord, the algorithm continuously recalculates the pitch of the notes of the other keys in order to always play correctly. <br><br>The philosophy behind Limouzik is to make music creation accessible to as many people as possible. Without solfeggio or training, Limouzik allows to reproduce, as with a piano or a guitar, classical, folk, popular and variety. <br><br>By grouping on the same key a complete chord of three notes, constantly recalculated by the algorithm, the user becomes almost instantly an instrumentalist able to play music as varied as Beethoven or the Beatles...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Polyphonic live instrument<br></li><li>128 Midi instruments Midi<br></li><li>Play harmonious pieces without knowledge of music theory nor musical practice!<br></li><li>2 mini games included: &quot;Simons Says&quot; and &quot;Cursus&quot;, to familiarize yourself with the software and its concept.<br></li><li>Record your songs, export them and share them with your family or via the Steam Workshop [will be included in a future update]<br></li><li>Transposition of scores possible in all tones<br></li><li>Converter: no need for solfeggio knowledge, Limouzik automatically generates everything according to the chord grid or the tablature of the piece you submit<br></li><li>Virtual synthesizer compatible: use Garage Band or other virtual synthesizer sounds instead of those included by default with the software<br></li><li>Beat Box included</li></ul>",
