    "description": "First created for the Social Justice Game Jam, this VR experience is about a teenager who has encountered some hardship, and now is living on a fishing boat. Every day they wake up and sort fish to pay off their debts. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay focuses on sorting fish into buckets. Some fish are worth more than others, but inside your tiny room, you can't control what will be available to sort. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe whole experience lasts about 30 minutes. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDeveloped on the HTC Vive. Tested on HTC Vive and Windows Mixed Reality.",
