    "description": "<strong>WARNING: This game is deep &amp; complex! Take a moment to look over the Quick Guide:  Watch the SteamVR mechanics video if playing in VR. 3089 vs 5089 questions? FAQ here.</strong><br><br>5089 expands upon 3089, bringing you back to planet Xax 2000 years later. After the mysterious events in the year 4089, the Overlord hasn't been heard from for the last millennium, and so the experimental robots have continued to wage war according to their program. Without the Overlord to repair the damage, Xax has fallen into a state of chaos and dereliction. However, a shadowy new power has risen... how will your presence turn its fate?<br><br>Shoot, sneak, build, talk, slash, buy, sell, fly, swing, hover, scavenge, teleport &amp; conquer your way through an endlessly generated planet. You can do it all with a friend, too. 5089 includes a rework of 3089 &amp; does not require the original to play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Newly Added &amp; Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Virtual Reality</strong>: Play 5089 with any SteamVR device, like the Rift or Vive!
