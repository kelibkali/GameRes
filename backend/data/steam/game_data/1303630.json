    "description": "Rachael Savage is a game about hunting down various killers in search of mystical medallions. These medallions help open up a gate to find the Infinkey, which gives a user whatever they desire. But it won't be easy, as there's always bad guys on the loose! You're also searching for Sadrix, who has the final medallion and is after the Infinikey. What will he wish for if he gets to it first?<br><br>This game is an action platformer where you play as a bounty hunter named Rachael. She can turn invisible and sneak past enemies, or even use it to her advantage to take them out without them even knowing. She wields a sword to slash through the bad guys and also finds other items along the way. She's free to explore the town and talk to the people there, taking bounties along the way in the form of sidequests. Many characters like to relax in the Bee Keep, a local tavern for travelers and bounty hunters alike!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Sword slashing action</li><li>Invisibility mechanic to keep enemies confused</li><li>Secrets to find hidden away</li><li>Collectables to boost your abilities</li><li>New items and armor</li><li>An epic Tales of Alethrion crossover from their Youtube series</li><li>An Untitled Goose cameo</li><li>A game I hope people enjoy, made by one person excluding music</li><li>And a cool villain to take down!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Inlcudes</h2><strong>Rachael's Bounty:</strong> The primary campaign that is playable from the start.
