PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE IT UNLESS YOU HAVE A EITHER OF THESE AND WANT TO ACTIVELY SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GAME AND ARE PREPARED TO HANDLE A FEW ISSUES. <br><br><br><br>Crooked Waters is a multiplayer virtual reality game where players immerse in thrilling sea fights. Together with your fellow pirates you'll try to survive the clash with other pirate ships.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Weigh the anchor! Load the cannons! Set sail!</h2>The ship won't conquer the enemy on it's own, and it needs its crew. Are you a captain? A cannoneer? Or a mere Scallywag? There is no rank when you're in the heat of battle. Adjust the sails so you'll have the speed advantage, supply your cannoneers with ammo or chant some Yo Ho Ho! and Ye He He to keep the morale high. Sink those Scurvy Dogs when you get the chance, because there is no room for others in these Crooked Waters.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/815280/extras/b4fd971c444fe34bc98e0053182b6ee0.poster.avif?t=1597411596\" width=600 height=148 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/815280/extras/b4fd971c444fe34bc98e0053182b6ee0.webm?t=1597411596\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/815280/extras/b4fd971c444fe34bc98e0053182b6ee0.mp4?t=1597411596\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>In Crooked Waters' newly added gamemode &quot;Conquest&quot;, you and up to three other players man a pirate vessel and venture into uncharted territory to fight for the famous treasure that is hidden deep in a heavily fortified fortress.
