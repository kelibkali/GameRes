    "description": "The 'Stranded Deep Original Soundtrack' by composer duo Paul Stähr and Felix Bachlinger aka Only Sound contains music created exclusively for the indie survival hit!<br><br>The album features four instrumentalists on this unique sounding score as well as some custom built instruments consisting of scrap materials such as wood, metal and stone. These elements combined provide a yet unheard world of soundscapes we are excited to share.<br><br><i>&quot;Working on the music of Stranded Deep was an adventurous journey. Over the course of a few weeks, we were in search of the primal, rough side of nature, which one has to face at the sight of total isolation from civilization.<br><br>We pondered about the essence of the human survival instinct, but we also explored the beauty of a quiet campfire at night or the pain of homesickness.<br>This soundtrack is the result of this journey and we hope it enriches the game with a piece of these experiences.&quot; <br>- Only Sound.</i>",
