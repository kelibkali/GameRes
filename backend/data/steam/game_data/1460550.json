Every skill, ability, talent and Titan is available to use or play right from the start. There is no pay to win, or even pay to unlock. You won't lose because the opponents had better gear or paid for better skills, you'll only lose if the opponents are better. Everyone is on an even playing field, the only differentiator is skill.
