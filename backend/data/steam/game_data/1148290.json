    "description": "Ascend the crumbling ruins of a fallen kingdom by jumping, swinging, shooting, and teleporting your way through enemies and obstacles. New knowledge and abilities will aid you on your increasingly challenging skyward journey. It's like a reverse Downwell or a reverse-inverted finite Doodle Jump.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA single game is quick and simple: reach the sun with as much silver as possible. Silver represents both currency and score so purchasing useful power-ups must be balanced with the long term goal of a respectable grade. Death will start you back at the beginning with nothing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe controls in Thy Kingdom Crumble are a little different than your usual platformer. Left clicking will have you jump towards the cursor and a right click activates any equipped abilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe haunting soundtrack was composed by Gisula.",
