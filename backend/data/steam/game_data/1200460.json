    "description": "Welcome to LawLawLand! It is a country where everybody follows the law, no matter how absurd it may be at times. You are an ordinary factory worker, who accidentally becomes a member of parliament — now it’s your turn to decide where this country is headed. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are two parties at the Parliament: one always votes &quot;yea&quot; and the other &quot;nay&quot;. The votes are divided exactly in half and the final decision is always up to the player. Will you earn the love of the whole nation or will it be hatred instead? This depends solely on you!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, basically, Law Law Land is an open world adventure game focused on story, exploration and player decisions, featuring dozens of characters to meet and things to do.",
