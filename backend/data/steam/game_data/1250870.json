The game is based off of Moons of Madness and very much inspired by The Secret World universe.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Originally created as a transmedia campaign to promote the release of Moons of Madness, featuring a live event in Berlin and interactive online community events, the game has since been enhanced with more puzzles and new content to replace the live elements.

Write your answer anywhere in the floating darkness and wait for a response from the mysterious entity. Good or bad, this presence will react to all your guesses until you’ve broken the seal. Once you’ve solved the enigma, you’ll be given access to one of Dr. Olivia Mason’s transmissions. Her personal logs will give you insight about life on the Cyrano spaceship, her findings, status on the crew’s journey and much more.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Keep in mind that most of these puzzles were originally designed to be solved in teams by entire online communities. So feel free to reach out the Cyrano Story fans on Discord for clues or even take a look at the various ARG collectives. You can also rely on the difficulty labels associated with each puzzle : Sane, On the edge, Crazy, Insane, Mental Breakdown or Higher plane, to brace yourself before you get in too deep.</p>",
