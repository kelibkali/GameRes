Each level is an abstraction of Lona’s story and it is up to you to bring peace and balance to her painting and find out what has happened to her.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1653700/extras/fc8169c65903e544e196a55e78cbd477.avif?t=1625832142\" width=680 height=278 /></span><br>Each level has two sides: a chaotic side represented by Ms. Schmidt the cat and a dark side represented by Mr. Ruppel the crow. You can switch between the two worlds at will and try to bring balance to these extreme interpretations of a single situation. You can use items from each world in the other one and everything you do might affect both worlds. There will be 15 unique scenes from Lona’s memory and paintings each having two sides.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1653700/extras/2ae99df5b461a4447b0dbe6f374f48f8.avif?t=1625832142\" width=680 height=281 /></span>",
