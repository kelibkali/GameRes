Upgrade your weapons with scrap metal collected from dead zombies inside the broken spaceship to improve your chances. Find extra ammo on the corpses of zombies. Run from the fast and strong centurion zombies. Dodge zombies being thrown at you by bowler zombies. Avoid the piles of goo from the goospitter zombies. Dodge rocks getting thrown at you by pelter zombies.",
