S. rail titans Norfolk Southern and CSX with High Iron Simulations’ Coal District Scenario Pack 01!<br><br>Train Simulator’s Norfolk Southern Coal District route represents the essence of Allegheny- region coal-hauling. Historically, the route was the Monongahela Railway, and today it is owned by Norfolk Southern with CSX sharing operating rights. Now, Coal District Scenario Pack 01 puts you at the throttle of a wide variety of NS and CSX trains operating over the famous and rugged line.<br><br>Coal District Scenario Pack 01 delivers ten new and realistic career scenarios featuring NS and CSX heavy coal trains, local freight operations, and special maintenance-of-way duties. In Coal District Scenario Pack 01, you’ll be called for work across the length and breadth of the coal district route, including Alicia, Brownsville, West Brownsville, Waynesburg, Emerald Mine, and the remarkable Manor Branch and massive Bailey Mine.<br><br>Based on actual NS and CSX operations and train symbols, the ten challenging career scenarios of Coal District Scenario Pack 01 will place you in the engineer’s seat of Norfolk Southern’s modern and powerful General Electric ES44ACs and Dash 9-40Cs, CSX’s leviathan Electro-Motive SD80MACs, and NS’s unique high-nose EMD GP38-2s.<br><br>Note: This pack’s scenarios require the Train Simulator Norfolk Southern Coal District route.
