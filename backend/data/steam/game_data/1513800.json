    "description": "JPN Burst is an ambitious indie game that compiles 90+ Japanese characters into easy lessons and true test-your-skill challenges.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Learn Japanese</h2>The Japanese writing system is composed of Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. Instead of A to Z, Hiragana letters range from あ (a) to ん (n). Katakana will also range from ア (a) to ン (n). You will use the English equivalent (Romaji) to type Hiragana and Katakana.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1513800/extras/79381c6c6c8372389bcbbac048d66495.poster.avif?t=1636913319\" width=600 height=336 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1513800/extras/79381c6c6c8372389bcbbac048d66495.webm?t=1636913319\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1513800/extras/79381c6c6c8372389bcbbac048d66495.mp4?t=1636913319\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>You'll get 12 lessons and 4 tests for Hiragana. You'll also get 12 more lessons and 4 tests for Katakana. You can approach either one at any time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Test Your Knowledge</h2>Test: 15+ kana. Short time windows. Relentless patterns. Can you type it fast enough under pressure?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Type on your Command</h2>Take full advantage of your keyboard! You won't have to wait your turn in this real-time gameplay.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Extraordinary Tools</h2>No kana is too difficult. You can get free hints. You can mash your keyboard until it works. You can do both, making you unstoppable.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Multiple Save Files</h2>Some apps restrict you to one account, meaning only one save file. Some games restrict to just three save files. JPN Burst offers MANY save files, so you, your spouse, your family, and maybe even the future you can enjoy a personal experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >New Game+</h2>Once you have learned the characters, it is not enough to just know them. Without practice, your memory will scatter the hard-learned lessons to the back of your brain. To account for that, you can replay the game with its harder difficulties.",
