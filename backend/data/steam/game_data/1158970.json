A man who has seen many odd things in his life but has delved into research into the occult as of late. <br>He has devoted years of his life in the search for an ancient alchemical formula that is said to control space and time.  He found what he was looking for in Vörnum, an island off the coast of Norway. <br>He brought all the material back to his home in order to study it without distractions. <br>Theodore believes this would free his wife Elizabeth from her nightmarish illness but something darker and more sinister is hidden within those passages, or even himself.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1158970/extras/613a41b72a7b97cbad1df597c3ff4c27.poster.avif?t=1681375616\" width=600 height=351 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1158970/extras/613a41b72a7b97cbad1df597c3ff4c27.webm?t=1681375616\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span> <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1158970/extras/78585da3cd47f8452f2f42369c9110a6.poster.avif?t=1681375616\" width=600 height=349 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1158970/extras/78585da3cd47f8452f2f42369c9110a6.webm?t=1681375616\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1158970/extras/3279d9cbfa6d363616c89041dbd3f222.webp?t=1681375616\" width=200 height=45 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay</h2>You will make your way through the volumes of corridors and rooms inside the mansion, and the darkness of the grounds outside, uncovering secrets and solving clues to reveal answers that will let you continue your journey.
