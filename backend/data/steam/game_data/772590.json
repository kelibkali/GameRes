    "description": "You regain consciousness in a closed room, how did you get there? Why is there a coffin? Are you dead? None of this matters now, all you can do is keep going.<br />\r\nThis game is a virtual reality experiment, about puzzles and ancient tombs, involving:<br />\r\n-\tContraptions<br />\r\n-\tTraps<br />\r\n-\tTreasures<br />\r\n-\tMysticism<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith your purchase you gain access to a room escape game with 2 rooms featuring 7 puzzles with a total of 42 keys. This is not a horror or suspense experience; there are no jump scare or time-is-running-out mechanics. Take all the time you need to solve the puzzles. This game supports room-scale VR. Works best when standing, but can be played seated as well. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe controls include:<br />\r\n-\tTrigger to grab and interact with objects.<br />\r\n-\tPad to teleport to location.<br />\r\n-\tGrip to either take screenshots or change view modes depending on user preference.<br />\r\n-\tMenu to open the game menu.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther settings (inside the game) are:<br />\r\n-\tShow FPS.<br />\r\n-\tChange screen scale to fit user’s hardware (bigger scale needs more resources but looks better).<br />\r\n-\tChange language (so far English and Spanish have been implemented).<br />\r\n-\tReset the room.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther features:<br />\r\n-\tGameplay menu with objectives and a hint system.<br />\r\n-\tCommentary menu with additional information about the game, the author, tools used and special thanks.",
