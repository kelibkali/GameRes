    "description": "Play as a super skilled combatant, with superhuman speed and agility. Fight against merciless demons, while dashing and jumping to dodge evil traps through carefully designed levels.<br><br>In this DEMO, you can play a careful selection of 4 handcrafted levels.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Infinite ammunition always</h2>The focus of <i>Humanless</i> is on the fun of shooting and platforming. You don't need to save the ammo of your favorite weapon: pull the trigger as much as you wish and have fun watching low resolution demons being shattered to pieces.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Fast and responsive movements on the controller that suits you best</h2>Enemies shooting with a real intention to kill and pits of acid waiting to be jumped through will require of you a lot of dexterity. For this reason, <i>Humanless </i>allows you to play both on the joystick or using the keyboard and mouse.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Carefully designed levels</h2>Each level was carefully designed and tested to be unique, fun and challenging yet fair. Checkpoints after each section ensure that your progress will never be lost.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >20 Levels distributed in three episodes</h2>Start in a <strong>devastated city</strong>, enter questionable <strong>military research labs</strong>, and attempt to finish your journey going down to the <strong>hell itself</strong>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >An elegant action platformer</h2><strong>No</strong> walls of text of story. <strong>No</strong> infinite repetitions of the same section of a level. In <i>Humanless</i>, each level is unique and brings something new, providing an experience that stays fresh throughout the whole game.",
