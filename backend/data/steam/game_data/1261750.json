Oblivious to the rising epidemic, he innocently wonders around the apartment and comes across Frank…who is eating his wife. Andrew, horrified of the man-eating Frank, is stunned as Frank lunges at him with great force. Andrew takes out his knife and ends Franks life. His own guilt of killing his friend leaves him shocked. With what he knows now, he tries to escape his apartment that is now filled with man-eating humans. Could this be Em-A-Li’s doing? She is an A.I, new to the human world, that has been looking for Stu since her last encounter with him. Where is Stu now? Uncover the intertwined characters of Em-A-Li and Andrew as this story continues on from the game, ‘Em-A-Li' in this top down, indie horror game.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1261750/extras/3b47076441a210c435319c771ab888fe.poster.avif?t=1695092077\" width=466 height=107 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1261750/extras/3b47076441a210c435319c771ab888fe.webm?t=1695092077\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><strong>Full Voice Acting Cast</strong><br>Inspired by Portal 2, Amelea Michaela Morrow takes the stage of Em-A-Li, a programmed A.I. designed to be a house wife or ‘Wife Bot’.
