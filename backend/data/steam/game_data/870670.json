    "description": "Decode the cipher in Ink Cipher!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInk Cipher is a sleek take on the puzzle sometimes known as the Cipher Crossword, Code Word, Code Breaker or Kaidoku.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou're presented with a grid filled with words... except all the letters have been replaced by numbers. Each number represents its own letter. Using your knowledge of the English lexicon (and the occasional hint from the puzzle title), fill in the letters where you can recognise words, and crack the cipher!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInk Cipher is touch friendly (requires no keyboard input), intuitive to play for anyone, and contains a help screen on how to play.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContains over 200 puzzles, with free updates planned.",
