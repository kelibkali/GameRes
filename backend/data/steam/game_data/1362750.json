Unfortunately, one day an evil goblin from the other side of the world learned of the 1000 Magical Crystals and grew jealous of King Estar. Eventually, he decided that he will use his great magic to cast a spell, a spell so evil and so powerful that it would cast a 1000 Magical Crystals across the entire world and leave all of Divia sad and dark forever. With the King`s Magical Crystals scattered and chaos threatening to destroy the whole realm, the King has chosen You to embark upon a quest to recover the Magic Crystals. Come, we must hurry, time grows short!<br />\r\nCollect all crystals in one area to proceed to another.<br />\r\nAction game with 24 levels of pure fun!",
