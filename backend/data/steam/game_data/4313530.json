    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Is there salvation in this &quot;world&quot;?</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>天使戦争 Angels' War</i> is a free fan-made &quot;souls-like&quot; action game, featuring Amane Kanata from Hololive 4th Gen as the main character. In this game, our angel Amane Kanata soars  the sky to reach the end of this imaginary world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This is a short game featuring only a few boss fights.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Note from the Author</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Inspired by  Amane Kanata's 3D Live, I started developing this game as a passion side project mid-2025. As a Heimin (Kanata‘s fan), I wanted to create an experience where Kanata is flying in the sky, overcoming any obstacles she faces, just like the legendary idol and VTuber herself. The original scope was bigger, and the project was initially planned to be finished in 2027.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>After Kanata’s graduation announcement on December 2nd, 2025, I almost gave up on this game for... a day. But in the end, I decided that I had something I needed to express, and that I still had an experience I wanted to share in this game. I decided to take a break from work until Christmas 2025, holing myself up in my apartment to finish the game with reduced scope, &quot;if this game would at least function as a game by then, I would release it as a free and non-commercial game available to the world&quot;. I managed to finish it 2 hours before Kanata's farewell live concert on December 27, 2025.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Note that the narrative is strongly fan-oriented.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>In certain situations in the game, messages collected from fellow Heimins will appear at random. Through this, we hope to let at least one  player know that &quot;you are not alone.&quot;</i> <i>These messages are presented in their original languages, mostly Japanese.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>The game may be short and feel unpolished, and it is a very different game from the original vision, but still, I tried my best in this short period to convey the experience I want to share. If you find enjoyment, I would be very happy.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>-Windy Darian</i></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Controls</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Controls manual is also available at in-game pause menu.
