Or avoid reloading all-together by never missing an attack!</h2>Each stage is a unique shoebox diorama, filled with action-oriented puzzles and delightfully violent Boxy creatures to battle.<br>Each Boxy type is susceptible to exactly one kind of attack, out of four in your arsenal, but actually landing an attack requires learning enemy patterns and controlling enemy groups.<br>And that’s before encountering the dreaded… Zomboxies.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1631770/extras/252f5d83817ea41384e5f3ebae1a382f.avif?t=1623134026\" width=600 height=100 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Here’s the deal with Boxy World - it’s greatest resource is its people. <strong>Literally.</strong></h2>Every house, couch or deadly weapon is made from the corpses of dead Boxy’s. Luckily every Boxy is exactly 10 x 10 in proportion - except for little Moxy Boxy. Manufactured at only 8 x 8, she literally does not fit in.<br>Desperate to be accepted, Moxy proves herself as a powerhouse Green soldier, taking on Blues, Reds and Purples with deadly precision.<br>Until one afternoon when she encounters a Yellow Boxy - long thought extinct - and is ordered to destroy her on sight. Every Boxy is a potential resource, after all.<br>The Indestructible Moxy Boxy is an examination of guilt, consequences and atonement, told over five acts and 150 dioramas.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1631770/extras/0b2a55373d8b2cbb833bf80e37a7f872.poster.avif?t=1623134026\" width=500 height=282 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1631770/extras/0b2a55373d8b2cbb833bf80e37a7f872.webm?t=1623134026\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1631770/extras/0b2a55373d8b2cbb833bf80e37a7f872.mp4?t=1623134026\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
