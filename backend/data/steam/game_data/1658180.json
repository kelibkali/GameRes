    "description": "Gosh A Ghost is an online multiplayer action game set in a haunted mansion. Outsmart ghosts to win the round!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSet in a sixties mansion, bright garish colors awash the walls and furniture. Creepy crawlies  in every corner are living quite happily alongside the ghosts. Hidden within the rooms are many secrets. Special actions will unlock areas, for example, pulling on a book or twisting the head of a statue. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nChoose to use a keyboard to type actions or stick with a mouse to point and click. Both systems work seamlessly alongside each other. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHave you got what it takes to become the greatest ghost hunter the world has ever seen?",
