This application is not meant as a 3D Modeling tool. It was purely developed as an experimental tool to develop frames for concept art and stills for video production. Nothing more. It's released as is. Thank you to the 10k+ users who tried it, we hope some people got some use out of it.</i>  </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Current Features (Basic)</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Transform, scale and rotate scene elements </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Primitive Library for creating objects from shapes </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Lighting support including Directional Light, Point and Spot (Includes Shadow Casting) </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Fully posable characters with Inverse Kinematics (Hands, Waist, Head, Feet) </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Built in screen-capture tool for saving out frame stills </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Save and Load Scenes</p></li></ul>",
