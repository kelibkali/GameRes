Either choose &quot;The Dark Files&quot; option for the randomly generated mansion to exorcise the hauntings or choose &quot;New Game&quot; to jump into a long, story driven, campaign where you get to explore scary environments, solve classic adventure game style puzzles and battle monsters along the way. <br><br><br><strong>Story</strong><br><br><i>The story is focused on shooting monsters, solving puzzles, and exploring varied environments while following a story. This is the option for people who prefer an adventure rather than a jump-scare experience.</i><br><br>Demonic possessions? Haunted dolls? They’re real. And the only way to fully exorcise this evil is by entering into the 11th dimension. <br><br>You play as Dr. Dark, who discovered this secret from a demon by successfully performing an exorcism on himself. Now named after Dr. Dark, “The Dark Method”, is the only known way to fully exorcise evil. <br><br>Dr. Dark’s work has drawn the attention of certain government officials and is now asked to perform an exorcism on their behalf. But little does he know, there's more to this request than what meets the eye.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1462700/extras/f68ea52991e95aee16df81457c7c6174.poster.avif?t=1739052391\" width=616 height=346 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1462700/extras/f68ea52991e95aee16df81457c7c6174.webm?t=1739052391\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1462700/extras/f68ea52991e95aee16df81457c7c6174.mp4?t=1739052391\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Fight your way through hordes of monsters!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1462700/extras/f2471cea0ca91f66ef0ca01ed9665e8e.poster.avif?t=1739052391\" width=616 height=346 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1462700/extras/f2471cea0ca91f66ef0ca01ed9665e8e.webm?t=1739052391\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1462700/extras/f2471cea0ca91f66ef0ca01ed9665e8e.mp4?t=1739052391\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Explore haunted mansions, catacombs, mountain paths, caves and much more!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1462700/extras/32db01fcaff6626b4513d9661f02a7d5.poster.avif?t=1739052391\" width=616 height=346 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1462700/extras/32db01fcaff6626b4513d9661f02a7d5.webm?t=1739052391\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1462700/extras/32db01fcaff6626b4513d9661f02a7d5.mp4?t=1739052391\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Solve classic adventure style puzzles and uncover the secrets of the 11th dimension!<br><br><strong>The Dark Files</strong><br><br><strong>WARNING:</strong> <i>Unlike the story option, these exorcisms are created to be scarier and more heart pounding experiences.</i><br><br>What does Dr. Dark do outside the main story? He does more exorcisms! <br><br>The randomly generated mansion will keep you guessing each time you play as you try to collect all items required for the exorcism. Find keys to open locked doors, find the secret passage to the ritual room, and hopefully conduct the ritual before the haunting catches you. All items, keys, corridors, rooms etc. are randomized so each time you play, you’ll have a unique scary experience. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1462700/extras/e237b7506f6c91736002532fbfcda914.poster.avif?t=1739052391\" width=616 height=346 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1462700/extras/e237b7506f6c91736002532fbfcda914.webm?t=1739052391\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1462700/extras/e237b7506f6c91736002532fbfcda914.mp4?t=1739052391\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><br><strong>FAQ</strong><br><br>-\tSnap Turn and smooth turn options available (along with smooth turn speed selection)<br>-\tFree locomotion and teleport (teleport only available in campaign) options available<br>-\tThe game does NOT support Virtual Desktop, Oculus Quest users please use Air Link for wireless gameplay<br>-\tOBS and LIV FPS Stabilizer might crash game if you don’t have enough memory<br>-\tValve Index is tested and supported<br>-      There is a newly designed autosave feature has been added based on community feedback so after completing puzzles or picking up important items or reaching certain milestones in each level, the game will automatically save.
