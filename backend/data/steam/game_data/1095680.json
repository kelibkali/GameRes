He had his first and last chance to become a wizard.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInstead of having no magic or skill, he has strong power and spirit and has to leap over competing wizards with it!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main character will never give up! At least not unless you give up!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nP.S You can stream this game to your heart's content. On the contrary, I would be gratefulness. :)",
