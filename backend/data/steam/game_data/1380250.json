    "description": "<strong>Timber Jump</strong> is a VR game mimicking a true adventure experience that will make you face and conquer your <strong>height fears</strong>, and allow you to feel the experience of jumping between timbers above mountains.<br>This game can either be played directly on the floor or with the use of a supporting structure as illustrated in the pictures. However, care should be given when using a structure and the presence of an adult is required to avoid injury from falling (the adult should be positioned at near proximity from the player).<br><strong>Timber Jump VR</strong> is equipped with a default optional setup, as well as a customized one that allows the user to adjust the dimensions based on their own preference.",
