Massive earthquakes caused by major tectonic shifts that broke the continents apart, sinking entire cities beneath the boiling oceans, have changed the face of the earth. A mass explosion of volcanic eruptions across the world released gases and clouds of ash into our atmosphere that scattered for hundreds of thousands of miles, destroying the ozone layers and exposing the land to radiation, causing massive wildfires and pouring down acid rains for several years.<br><br>We hit them hard with everything we had, and we pushed back. But we were fighting a losing battle. After just a few months of war, our world became almost uninhabitable. Those of us who could, fled underground, resolving to small skirmishes, and scavenging for resources. Fighting to take back what we lost. But there were those who roamed the wasteland and made it their home.<br><br>Years of natural disasters and exposure to radiation scarred the land. But we were not ready to give up the fight. We learned about Entropies, how we came to call them. We learned how to hunt them, and we learned how to kill them. The battle for survival, was not yet lost.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1442630/extras/c8bde297ac37d07f1d7c0f79e34d0943.avif?t=1641662451\" width=619 height=103 /></span><br>As our world stands on the brink of destruction and humanity is facing extinction, you are invited to join the resistance and fight back against the mysterious enemy forces to reclaim our home.
