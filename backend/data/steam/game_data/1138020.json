Each player plays as a mystery creature called &quot;I&quot;(little eye), which is weak, helpless but greedy and fierce. It can parasitize and control every weapon or defense component it attaches. One day several &quot;I&quot;s meet in a small space and everyone wants to be king. While becoming larger and stronger, players must control their &quot;I&quot;s to fight with each other until last one survives.<br><br>During each round of the game, players are born within a survive circle and will get damage beyond the circle. At first there are random components around players and after a while floating supplies will come, attack the supplies then it will drop new components. Player must pick as many components as they can to become stronger to win the game. And each weapon has different feature to help to fight your opponents.<br><br>Defeated core of supply or other players will drop a golden core. Collect this golden core can let you achieve ultimate skills. Skill of one core is a beam sword, skill of two cores is a reflection shield which can reflect the bullets and skill of three cores is to summon 12 sniper rifles to shoot your opponents.<br><br>As a new comer we recommend you begin from first level as weapons are introduced step by step. If you are already familiar with the game and want to play high with your friends, you can choose the Total Battle mode in levels menu to have 5 rounds game with all the mechanism.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1138020/extras/a0314dc9cb71f37107ea1d9189626940.avif?t=1670244375\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><br>This game was developed as a student project at DigiPen Institute of Technology and was created for educational purposes only.
