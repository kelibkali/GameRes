Your task is simple. Command souls to fulfill the Emperor’s Will. <br><br><strong><u>Magnificent genre mix!</u></strong><br>While being a city builder at its very core, the game features elements of other strategy subgenres, with diplomacy and trading with other cities, as well as wuxia hero-focused turn-based combat!<br><br><strong><u>Across Valleys, Mountaintops and Floating Isles</u></strong><br>Expand your City across multiple levels of height with unique features, resources, pros and cons. Connect them with roads, bridges, and lifts to create efficient supply chains throughout your city.<br><br><strong><u>The Mysterious Living World</u></strong><br>Explore and interact with the living world of Nanzou with procedurally generated cities, characters, and events! Learn about your surroundings, send heroes on adventures, engage in diplomatic talks, or plan trading routes for caravans around the world! <br><br><strong><u>Cities as Battlefields</u></strong><br>Throughout the game, your city will face many dangers. During sieges, it will turn into an interactive battlefield, with destructible buildings, defensive structures, and siege weaponry. Train your mythical heroes to defend your city at all costs. You’re not limited to defense though - retaliate and attack the cities of your enemies or fight them in the open world in dynamic turn-based combat!<br><br><strong><u>Simple Rules, Complex Interactions</u></strong><br>Every core mechanic in the game is set on an easy to understand foundation with complexity rising over time, to create an experience accessible to everyone.
