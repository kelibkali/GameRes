    "description": "Without doubt flying virtual aircraft from your PC is one of the most interesting simulations – at the same time, it is one with a very steep learning curve. Holiday Flight Simulator, though, makes it especially easy to relive the last holiday trip from the cockpit’s view, even for less experienced PC pilots. Unlike more complex flight simulations, Holiday Flight Simulator was designed from the ground up to enable beginners to successfully complete a flight with less effort and learning. Advanced flight simulation enthusiasts in turn have a straightforward all-in-one solution at hand, including lots of airports right from the start.<br><br>The player can take place behind the control stick of one of the most well known airliners: the Airbus A320. Its cockpit places all the important functions and systems at the player’s disposal – voice recordings from real air traffic help create the appropriate atmosphere. Additionally, the simulation includes a Beechcraft Baron for short range and training flights.<br><br>Holiday Flight Simulator comes with 9 travel destinations out of the box, including the airports of Düsseldorf, Palma de Mallorca, London Heathrow, and Nice. Their 3D models are of high quality and rich in details. They also feature movable objects – luggage carts, busses, pushback trucks, jetways, etc. create lively apron scenery. A day and night cycle makes these sceneries appear in the right mood.<br><br>In the beginning, players can choose whether they want to fly freely between two airports or experience long-term thrill in the career mode.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/500170/extras/964bd2ef415b1706359d4d8e462f207e.avif?t=1668000394\" width=616 height=68 /></span><br><br><strong>Aircraft:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Airbus A 320<br></li><li>Beechcraft Baron</li></ul><br><strong>Flight area:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Europe</li></ul><br><strong>Airports:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Hamburg<br></li><li>Düsseldorf<br></li><li>Zürich<br></li><li>Paris Orly<br></li><li>London Heathrow<br></li><li>Nizza<br></li><li>Palma<br></li><li>Kos<br></li><li>Antalya</li></ul><br><strong>Game modes:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Tutorial<br></li><li>Random flight<br></li><li>Route selection<br></li><li>Career</li></ul><br><strong>Other:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Beginner friendly<br></li><li>Achievements<br></li><li>Day and night modes<br></li><li>Animated pilot models in the cockpit<br></li><li>Three camera views<br></li><li>Original voice recordings with real pilots<br>[*Liveries of various European airlines[/list]<br><br><i>„Holiday Flight Simulator“ and „Ready for Take Off“ are identical products.</i></li></ul>",
