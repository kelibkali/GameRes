    "description": "Accompany Lena, a young creative student on her adventure – solve tricky puzzles, experience funny situations and confront mean bullies!  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHardly a day goes by where Lena is not bullied in some way. Why? Because she is not like the others. She is a sensitive, creative and helpful person who is not interested in things like trends and fashion. Since she is being raised by her grandparents, those topics are not really important in her everyday life. This is one of the reasons why she is the target of a group of bullies who constantly harass her. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA game for every age with wonderful music, witty dialogues and scenes, tricky puzzles and interesting characters who are voiced by great people like Al Lowe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd the best thing: With each purchase a part of the profit gets donated to a befriended anti-bullying-organisation.",
