    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >  Pathfinder RPG - Chronicles: Faction Guide</h2>Loyalty over all<br>Every campaign has organizations that pull the secret strings of the world, toppling monarchs or leading revolutionaries toward freedom and war. These secret societies, bardic colleges, wizard academies, military orders, and religious cults capture the imagination--and now your PCs can join Golarion's own movers and shakers with the Pathfinder Chronicles Faction Guide. This book presents a new and detailed rules system for PCs who throw in their lot with one or more of these groups, as well as the responsibilities--and rewards--that membership entails. With membership in a faction, PCs gain a whole new reason to adventure, as well as countless roleplaying opportunities in any sort of campaign, from dungeon crawl to courtly intrigue.<br>In addition to new goals and motives, membership in a faction comes with tangible in-game benefits. Gain enough of a reputation with the Hellknights, and a PC can become a fearsome lictor, complete with Hellknight minions.
