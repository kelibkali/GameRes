Perhaps you managed to think out one of them so well that you literally immersed in it? Sometimes, when the soul is badly bad, you just want to take it and find yourself in a fantasy world where everything is fine, but there are no problems. But ... But suppose that in this world, you have terrible consequences for him, carrying a part of your problems into your own fragile world.<br>And now, now your world is bursting at the seams because of you, and you are simply stuck in it.<br>The game is a three-dimensional platformer-puzzle with elements of horror and parkour. The visual part of the game is made in the style of geometric surrealism.",
