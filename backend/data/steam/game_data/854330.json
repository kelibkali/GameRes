    "description": "Lost in Spice is a cooking game for Oculus Rift in which you play as an abducted human forced to cook Earth food for aliens at the Intergalactic House of Planets. Now you have to dice up weird ingredients, cook them, and submit them in the time limit to get a good score. And if you don't, you'll be vaporized!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game includes a tutorial to teach new players, and a timed high-score mode. There are 4 different soups to make: Tomato, carrot, chicken noodle, and french onion.",
