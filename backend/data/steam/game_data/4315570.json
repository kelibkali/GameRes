Survivors must rely on livestreaming to garner attention and slow their memory loss. You are Volpert, a second-tier livestreamer, your popularity dwindling, your memory index reduced to only 37%, and you could become a walking corpse at any moment. During an adventure, you encounter a severely infected, amnesiac girl. Her appearance causes a surge in viewership for your livestream, but it also draws you into a battle for viewership among top livestreamers, a dark conspiracy within the military, and the apocalyptic judgment of the infected leader. Lies and truth intertwine, survival and conscience clash. Will you succumb to the allure of false popularity and survive, or will you tear down the mask of revelry and seek redemption?</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4315570/extras/851e75fee263944bffbb76415fe1bc58.avif?t=1770398765\" width=1560 height=878 /></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><i>Female Character Introduction</i></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Amnesiac Girl Lily: From innocent dependence to awakening memories, will you maintain the &quot;autumn angel&quot; persona to attract fans, or help her uncover the truth and confront hatred? &quot;Top Streamer Susie&quot;: A hypocritical adversary behind a sophisticated utopia.
