Play as Josh, a teenage boy trying to reconcile a maze of two contrasting worlds that coexist within the blank spaces of each other - his perception of reality, and the world he created to avoid his fears.<br><br>Josh exists in these worlds as alter egos, Caleb and Ammiel. Caleb lives only in the white world, on the fringe of reality. He wants to overcome his fears. Ammiel resides in the darkness; he wants only to be alone and completely detached from human contact.<br><br>Take control of these egos and flip between both realms to solve problems and traverse obstacles. Learn to utilize both distinct spaces, to avoid obstacles and find a path to safety.",
