However that doesn't stop us from experiencing higher dimensions digitally. This is what 4DSnake is all about.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay as a snake, eat food, avoid obstacles. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is mainly played in a relative mode. In this mode, the camera is following you, so you are always positioned in the center of the screen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis demo contains the first scenario in relative mode and the first scenario in absolute mode.",
