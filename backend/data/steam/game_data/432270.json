    "description": "No Seat? is a unique trial bike game, now you can Track Stand, back wheel / side hop, 180 or pedal kick your way up and over obstacles instantly, without getting hurt or leaving your seat (pun indented!). <br />\r\nMountain bike trials, also known as observed trials, is a discipline of mountain biking in which the rider attempts to pass through an obstacle course without setting foot to ground. <br />\r\nTrials riding is an extreme test of bicycle handling skills, over all kinds of obstacles, both natural and man-made.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is 100% indie and was made by just one person. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome features:<br />\r\n-Aim to emulate trail biking, like no other game/simulation has before. <br />\r\n-Complete courses in time limit.<br />\r\n-Walk around the scene/course, then ride.<br />\r\n-Get Highscores.<br />\r\n-Bikes and Rider Physics/movement. <br />\r\n-Random foot down/dabs and chain breaks. <br />\r\n-Dabs/Foot down also depends on stamina, 5 Dabs means session over.<br />\r\n-Courses are taped off just like in real life, if you break the tape with your bike/wheel the session is over.<br />\r\n-Bailing off bikes (option remove the tomato sauce effect).<br />\r\n-Bikes setup area, geo adjust, grind wheel, chain tension/brake adjust, choose wheel size 20/26 inch.<br />\r\n-Custom rider/helmet area, you can choose between male and female characters.<br />\r\n-Gym area, you need to go to gym to build up stamina for longer back wheel hopping.. as you play more you also loose some stamina, so need to visit gym again.<br />\r\n-Multiplayer, now you'll be able to ride with friends from your PC.<br />\r\n-Level editor, you can create your own levels, save/share those with anyone. Anyone for a 100 meter drop off? :)<br />\r\n-Help section to explain how the game works.",
