Once you are finished you simply start the game and continue playing. Once the game is underway you can pause the game at any point to update or change your orders and the game will automatically pause when important events occur, so that you may modify your plans accordingly. This combat is combining the finely grained tactics of a turn-based game with the realism of a real time system.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Randomly generated tactical missions - each playing field will be unique meaning no two games are the same<br></li><li> Intricate, rich and frightening alien setting displayed in full 3D<br></li><li> Over 100 varied mission objectives<br></li><li> 70 plus unique weapons</li></ul>",
