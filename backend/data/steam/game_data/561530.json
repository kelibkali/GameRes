    "description": "Purchasing Froggy G will permanently unlock this character in Awesomenauts. The character can also be purchased with Awesomepoints in-game.<br><br>Froggy G is an accessible assassin that can dash around the battlefield and becomes a watery tornado to deal heavy close ranged damage. He comes equipped with the following abilities:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Dash through enemies, stunning and damaging them.<br></li><li>Use a rapid spinning technique, damaging all nearby enemies.<br></li><li>Bolt .45 fish-gun. Short-ranged but deadly.</li></ul><br><i>Straight out of the marsh pond ghetto's of planet Ribbit IV comes the amphibious B.I.G., also known as Nate Frogg, but mostly known as Froggy G. Growing up in the baddest part of town, struggle and incarceration surrounded Froggy from an early age. Taking part in his first swim-by shoot out as a tadpole, Froggy seemed destined for a life of crime and prison.<br><br>After a bloody gangwar with the neighbouring Toad-unit posse ended in a 5 year jail sentence, Froggy G vowed to end his gangsta ways. Instead, Froggy G started earning his keep as a beatboxing street dancer and rapper, hoping to be picked up by a major record label. Unfortunately, his tracks, titled &quot;Pond Pimpin'&quot;, &quot;Froggin' dirty&quot; and &quot;Motherfrogger bounce!&quot; didn't earn him much.<br><br>In order to make some money, and then make some mo', Froggy G became a hired gun. Combining his shoot-out experiences with lethal watery dance moves and beatboxing techniques, Froggy G now spins and dashes across intergalactic battlefields, droppin foo's left and right with his fishgun, hoping to make some money to take his momma out of the hood.</i>",
