    "description": "Streamline combines traditional platforming with a fresh take on physics based survival. Your goal is simple; stay alive for as long as possible in a world literally falling apart.<br><br>Since Streamline 1.0, there are now two gamemodes, &quot;Platform&quot; and &quot;Dash&quot;.<br><br>Build your own designs in the new &quot;Builder&quot; gamemode.<br><br>Platform is our survival gamemode, survive for as long as you can whist your platform is falling appart. Use your powers to retract the cubes to their original position.<br><br>Dash is our new gamemode where your objective is to capture the orbs and gain a score, also here the platform will fall apart. Use your powers to retract the cubes to their original position.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key features</h2><br>* <strong>Power:</strong> Use your power to retract the cubes to their original location. Power will be replenished over time.<br><br>* <strong>Unpredictable Gameplay:</strong> The game is largely controlled by randomised events ensuring no two games will be the same.<br><br>* <strong>Physics:</strong> Every cube has a mind of it's own and will calculate a path of it's own without the interference of other objects.<br><br>* <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Movement system and colliders have been optimised for smooth gameplay where every touch of the player will calm the cubes motion.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >F.A.Q.</h2> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >I saw this game on greenlight, what happened?</h2>The game has been in the dark since we launched on Greenlight not because we stopped working, quite the contrary. The game has undergone major changes and concepts have been scrapped frequently until we felt satisfied.",
