Enjoy a beautiful world and retro game-play as you dodge and shoot your way through classical stages. Choose one of 4 difficulty settings according to your set of skills and fight the evil empire! See how well you did using the Replay Mode and show your worth by getting all achievements.<br><br>Originally released on the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive consoles in 1992, it was later ported to the Nintendo Game Boy Advance in 2004 and to the Nintendo 3DS in 2014, and now is coming to PC! <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/563260/extras/febfb4f005a8fcc3383efbd1ec0187db.webp?t=1671622915\" width=356 height=43 /></span><br>Choose to fly one of two classes of fighter aircraft: the Etopirica (ET-02R), a small and a fast plane, or the Zappellon, a slower but more resistant zeppelin. You fly in only one direction, but you can fire from behind as well as ahead. Levels are divided into a few stages to complete, each with their own boss before moving onto the next level. After a level is complete, you can change your craft, watch a replay, continue the game in your current craft, or save your progress.<br><br>During the game there is a certain number of lives and continues at your disposal. Once the health bar is depleted, a life is lost with a play continuing normally. If all lives are used, you can hit a continue, which will restart at either the beginning or midpoint of a stage depending on how far you were. When all continues are expended, the game is over.<br><br>To increase your firepower, collect powerups such as experience points, health, bombs or additional lives.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/563260/extras/ac105336fb09794bf8175ed7d72923a3.webp?t=1671622915\" width=356 height=43 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Complete remake truthful to the original game, based on 3DS version with improved graphics and controls<br></li><li>Side-scrolling shoot'em up game, originally released on Sega Genesis and later on Game Boy Advance and Nintendo 3DS<br></li><li>7 complex stages full of adrenaline-pumping action and boss fights<br></li><li>Collect special power-ups and increase your firepower with a level-up system (up to 20 levels)<br></li><li>Steam Achievements &amp; Trading Cards<br></li><li>Full controller support<br></li><li>The classic is back!</li></ul>",
