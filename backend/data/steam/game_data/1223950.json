    "description": "Enjoy all the wonderful music from The Mystery Of Woolley Mountain in this rich and eclectic soundtrack from the game. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll songs written by David Lightfoot and Jonny Barnard.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Helmholtz Resonators are a renegade group of psychedelic audio scientists who have been playing and writing music together since the turn of the century. They studied acoustic science and the work of Hermann Von Helmholtz, being particularly inspired by his book On the Wires of our Nerves, essential reading for anyone interested in the science of sound and sound synthesis. Heavily inspired by the ethos behind concept albums, the band have created a repertoire of songs that are as eccentric as their image, touching on influences as diverse as The Residents and The Kinks to LCD Soundsystem and Hieronymous Bosch.",
