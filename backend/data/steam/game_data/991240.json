For international players, this filter captures most of those questions (mainly in the categories Geography &amp; Politics, History, and Sports).<br></li><li>🤨 <strong>More than just a casual game!</strong>  Trivia Throwdown’s unique promotion/relegation Ascent Mode means you can spend hours climbing to the top of 10 ranks of escalating difficulty – every match carries the stakes of bringing you one step closer to ranking up or down.<br></li><li>♟️ <strong>Strategic gameplay</strong>: both breadth of knowledge and playing up your own strengths are rewarded.  You can still win even if your knowledge is weak in one or two categories!<br></li><li>👪 <strong>Five distinct difficulties</strong> accomodate a wide range of skill levels.  With an optional adult content filter and novice-level difficulty setting, even kids can play!<br></li><li>📈 <strong>Dynamic difficulty scaling</strong>: questions become harder or easier based on your performance.<br></li><li>💡 <strong>Equal parts pop-culture and academic trivia</strong> from the following categories: Movies &amp; Television, Literature &amp; Fine Arts, Games, General Knowledge, Geography &amp; Politics, History, Music, Science &amp; Technology, and Sports.<br></li><li>🎵 <strong>Vibrant electronic soundtrack</strong> featuring 20+ synthwave, ambient hip hop, and 16-bit beat 'em up chiptune tracks.<br></li><li>🛋️ <strong>Local couch multiplayer</strong> - square off against a frienemy for a quick match (play with 2 controllers, or share a keyboard), or alternatively recruit them to feed you answers and help you top the Ascent Mode!<br></li><li>⏲️ <strong>Play as long as you like</strong> - Progress is saved after each question, so you can play for any stretch of time.</li></ul><br>Special Thanks to PixelTail Games (developer of TowerUnite, also available on Steam) and their Open Trivia Database for providing hundreds of additional questions.",
