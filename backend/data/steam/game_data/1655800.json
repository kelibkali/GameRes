The graphic style is retro with a modern twist, with gameplay taking place in an old-school isometric world, while the story unfolds as an interactive comic book with all illustrations hand-drawn in pixel art!<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1655800/extras/9705036024670272b61afe31c65c7538.webp?t=1647252344\"><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1655800/extras/9705036024670272b61afe31c65c7538.poster.avif?t=1647252344\" class=\"bb_img\" width=178 height=27 /></picture></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1655800/extras/5980a32d9c216132b100cc434f37e0e4.poster.avif?t=1647252344\" width=600 height=192 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1655800/extras/5980a32d9c216132b100cc434f37e0e4.webm?t=1647252344\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1655800/extras/5980a32d9c216132b100cc434f37e0e4.mp4?t=1647252344\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >THE STORY SO FAR:</h2>Adam is a young boy, who only remembers running away from the burning car his mother had just crashed into the side of a building.

This is where he meets the eccentric cleaning robot called TURBO. Despite its name, TURBO is clumsy and slow, but has a big digital heart. Adam and TURBO team up to escape the robots and uncover the truth surrounding the accident and the desolate city.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >IT'S A COMIC BOOK, TOO!:</h2>Get drawn into the game through its carefully illustrated pixel-art comic book. Your progress helps tell the story. Recover the missing pages to piece together the unsettling truth behind the accident and why you’re being followed wherever you go by deadly robots.

It serves to immerse you even further into the story, bringing you closer to Adam, the ordinary boy whose life depends on outsmarting his enemies. Stay undetected to keep the threat level low, or get detected to make enemies follow you, only to trick them into letting you into restricted areas. The threat level goes back down when you hide. But you can’t stay hidden forever!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >WELCOME TO AN UNWELCOMING CITY</h2>The streets of the city of <strong>New Eden</strong> are narrow and maze-like. The government has imposed a very strict curfew on the citizens, and tightly controls the flow of information. For these reasons, automatic drones are mobilized to patrol the street to arrest anyone who defies the curfew. The streets are also littered with AI controlled surveillance cameras. <br><br><br>Being a young boy, Adam’s chances of <strong>freedom </strong>are narrow. He cannot possibly fight back through sheer force, but together with TURBO, he just might have what it takes to sneak around and trick the enemies to his own advantage. As he explores the city in his quest to find more details about the accident, he must also collect encryption keys, called Data Cubes, allowing him to decrypt the information the local government does not want anyone to see. It turns out, that the quest might lead to a much <strong>darker path </strong>than first anticipated.",
