    "description": "Winter's Trumpet is a short Urban Fantasy point'n'click interactive love story set against the backdrop of an epidemic.<br><br>It was winter when the flu from Tarsia swept across Aeser... now you are quarantined with your roommate, Rosemary, who is bored out of her mind—and is more than a little suspicious of your mysterious suitor, Marcus. After all, the man clearly has secrets.<br><br>The Urban part of our Urban Fantasy game is a unique 1920s style fantasy world.<br><br>You will see the story through three sets of eyes: you play as Tetrine Reish, a mortal 'scrivener', or seer, able to see magic others can't, Kalevel Venhera, a vengeful demoness, and Markaius, an ancient and elusive demon.<br><br>Discover more of the World of Aeser, as seen in our previous game, <i>Tell a Demon</i> (also on Steam) and <i>Asher</i> (available for free on our website). This story chronologically takes place before the events of both <i>Asher</i> and <i>Tell a Demon</i>.",
