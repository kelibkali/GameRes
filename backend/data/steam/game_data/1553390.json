Play as one of 11 heroes, utilizing strategies with minimized deck RNG and enhanced skill expression. Climb the ranked ladders and assert your dominance!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The game has been developed with very open rules, not locking Heroes or Energy to specific cards, so every card can be played by all heroes. We do however have incentives in the form of &quot;discounts&quot; where the cards of the same type as the hero will cost 1 less. Additionally we do not prevent you from attacking your own cards or your own hero, unlocking some uniquely advanced plays.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>NOTE: This is NOT and will NEVER be a crypto or NFT game.</strong> </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Unique Gameplay Mechanics:</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>SharedBoard:</strong> A revolutionary concept that introduces both stability and unpredictability.

Further diversifying the gameplay each will work differently. Effect auras are static and provide effects as long as they are in the game. Equipment auras are on-use cards that can buff/debuff other cards on your command. Last but not least are protection auras, that you can pre-emptively place and they will trigger on certain actions.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Transcendent Abilities:</strong> Powerful abilities present on the rarest and best cards, allowing for more variation in a single card, as the same card can have over 15 variations of abilities. These cards are never available in purchasable packs, ensuring no pay-to-win scenarios.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1553390/extras/9dfe7484200726efe263019864e035de.avif?t=1755882991\" width=534 height=212 /></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Trade and Borrow:</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Bring authenticity to the online CCG world.
