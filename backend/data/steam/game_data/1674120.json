    "description": "Red Rust is retro-style side-scrolling game which uniquely combines fighting mechanics  with shooting mechanics. The game is heavily inspired by 8bit and 16bit hits of the 90s, but it’s being developed with the modern player in mind. Tons of great animation, hand-drawn backgrounds, variety of in-game situations and powerful soundtrack!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674120/extras/4c1bc8b40402381ac8c41aa60b908d35.poster.avif?t=1756497019\" width=500 height=282 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674120/extras/4c1bc8b40402381ac8c41aa60b908d35.webm?t=1756497019\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674120/extras/4c1bc8b40402381ac8c41aa60b908d35.mp4?t=1756497019\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>It's the year 1984 and you control Agent Red (or just Red), a soviet KGB officer who has been sent to the West on a secret mission.
