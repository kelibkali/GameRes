    "description": "Many years ago one sad and scared boy built a strange labyrinth under his bed. It was a prison for dangerous monsters, full of long corridors and narrow tunnels. The boy tried with all his might, but he couldn't fight back the beasts. They were stealing his favourite toys, souvenirs, treasures, memories... everything was getting lost in the abyss. On one memorable day, the most horrible of monsters reached out his hideous hands and took something that could not be replaced. A loss so big it would be unbearable even for a grown-up.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1527880/extras/ee90723b1a31f0c1b95d8ea75d3949d0.poster.avif?t=1731935920\" width=558 height=218 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1527880/extras/ee90723b1a31f0c1b95d8ea75d3949d0.webm?t=1731935920\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1527880/extras/ee90723b1a31f0c1b95d8ea75d3949d0.mp4?t=1731935920\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>The boy was paralysed with fear for long months.
