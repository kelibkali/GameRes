    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Castle of the Winds is a classic early Windows roguelike. Set in a world inspired by Norse mythology, players explore procedurally generated dungeons near a quiet village, battling monsters, discovering magical items, and unraveling the mystery of an ancient evil. Castle of the Winds became a formative introduction to roguelikes for an entire generation of PC players, and remains a fondly remembered gem of the Windows 3.x era.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>As a faithful port from the original source, you can expect:</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Amazing 16 color  pixel art! State of the art effects from 1989!</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Hand crafted town levels and procedurally generated dungeons! </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Dozens of magic spells to learn!  Infinite magic items to find! </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A drag and drop inventory interface that was novel at the time (mice were new back then).</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A keyboard interface that supports both the numeric keypad and the classic rogue movement keys. </p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A classic Windows Help File for documentation, even though I had to recreate the help engine myself.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Seriously, this is all about nostalgia.  We did add support for Steam achievements and Cloud Saves, but if you're expecting 3D art, shaders, and particle effects you're in the wrong place!  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This version of the game has been lovingly (?) recreated by original developer Rick Saada to run on modern 64 bit Windows environments. It contains both Part 1: <i>A Question of Vengeance</i> and Part 2: <i>Lifthransir's Bane.</i></p>",
