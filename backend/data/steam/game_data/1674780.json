You can for instance parry anything that would normally would damage you, but parrying incoming projectiles in particular will shoot them back at foes. You are however never forced to parry and you can even change how the parry system works by equipping Emblems!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Emblems are items you will find all over the world. Equipping an Emblem might change how the parried projectile behaves, for instance, you can make it home into enemies but deal less damage. Or instead of bouncing a projectile off your cap you will do damage to anything near you. There is even a Vortex Emblem which destroys multiple projectiles around the player.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674780/extras/33fdf43d33880ad14f0bb546e2c72844.avif?t=1762508625\" width=640 height=100 /></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Upgrades and Build customizations</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >In addition to Emblems, there are Relics that work very similarly to the Charm system in Hollow Knight.

You can make some really specialized builds focusing on defense, healing, speed, melee attacking, or spell-casting!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >And then there are permanent upgrades that you gain from fighting bosses, these are all from spells to new moves and types of attacks!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674780/extras/de41f0402ed6ed8c2e2182b4c80e4705.poster.avif?t=1762508625\" width=640 height=100 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674780/extras/de41f0402ed6ed8c2e2182b4c80e4705.webm?t=1762508625\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674780/extras/de41f0402ed6ed8c2e2182b4c80e4705.mp4?t=1762508625\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Bosses</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >In Lone Fungus, you can challenge and defeat 33 bosses to acquire new abilities. My goal is to design engaging and equitable boss battles that can be won without sustaining any damage from the boss. To achieve this, I craft distinct attack patterns for each boss and provide clear cues before their strikes. Additionally, I limit the randomness of their attacks.

Instead, all the platforming challenges are confined to optional side rooms, allowing you to relish the game as a Metroidvania-style adventure game focused on combat and exploration, while still benefiting from the precise controls of a precision platformer.
