    "description": "You are born into a strange world where the laws of physics seem not to apply to you. Gravity can change direction as you see fit and if you make a mistake, never fear! Time can be reversed so you can try again. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this pixel art inspired 2D platformer you will explore an alien planet, collecting various items while avoiding obstacles and solving puzzles by shifting gravity to get around. A benevolent AI called D.I.A.N.E. will be your guide as you traverse the landscape and learn more about this strange sensation called &quot;being alive&quot;.",
