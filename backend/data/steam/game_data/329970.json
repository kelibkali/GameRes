As an evil keeper you will dig out and construct a dungeon and recruit malicious minions to help do your bidding. You’ll train and equip them and take up the fight with the forces of good around you.  <br> <br>Engage in combat and take direct control of your minions and in true roguelike fashion fight tactical battles in a simultaneous turn-based manner. When you make a move, your enemies also move.   </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Dungeon management </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Dig deep into the mountain and establish a great dungeon to fit the needs of you and your minions.

Your choice of faction will impact gameplay and the style of your dungeon.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Roguelike</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The world is procedurally generated and simulated on a very detailed level. Creatures use equipment and consumable items. There are dozens of special items, spells, attributes and special attacks.
