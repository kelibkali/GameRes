    "description": "Candlewind is a small and peaceful town where everyone lives in harmony. At least, that's what it used to be. The forces of darkness have come to stay. Deep in the depths of the earth, a dark power is rearing its ugly head. The villagers are blissfully unaware — for the moment. You alone can prevent the destruction of Candlewind. Ride into battle with your warriors, explore dark dungeons, discover legendary treasures, and protect Candlewind from the danger it knows nothing of.<br><br>The Legend of Candlewind: Nights &amp; Candles returns to the traditions of old role-playing legends. Go up against the forces of evil in hand-drawn dungeons, step by step. Following in the footsteps of classic dungeon crawlers, players will take part in turn-based battles that will put their skills to the ultimate test. Only true role-playing gamers will have any chance of survival!<br><br><br><strong>Hand-drawn graphics</strong><br>Exactly like it used to be: Every single little detail in The Legend of Candlewind has been drawn by hand. The hand-crafted visuals create an atmosphere that has not been seen for a long time in today's role-playing games.<br><br><strong>A giant dungeon to explore</strong><br>A vast dungeon awaits! Under the town of Candlewind, an enormous cavern with ten different levels waits to be explored. In addition, there are also numerous hidden rooms, secret sections and multiple ways of traversing the gloomy passages. But watch out: There's no way to know if a nasty goblin's around that next corner.<br><br><strong>Turn by turn</strong><br>Real-time battles? Not here! Strategy and tactics are core to The Legend of Candlewind. In the turn-based battles, it is wits, and not speed, which will lead you to success. Plan your every step with care, as your opponents will exploit every single one of your mistakes to make your life a living hell — so don't give them an opportunity to do so.<br><br><strong>Retro and hardcore</strong><br>No, The Legend of Candlewind definitely isn't a walk in the park, but experienced role-playing gamers will appreciate the challenge: Especially as they will definitely remember the classic dungeon crawlers that served as the basis for the development of this game.",
