    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Mechanics</h2><br>     The most important mechanic in the game is the absorb. We wanted to make the game different from other spaceshooters by limiting your ability to shoot. The only way you can replenish your ammo is by absorbing asteroids or enemies, but be aware that absorbing enemies comes at a cost, it takes out some of your energy.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1068990/extras/a849497689afc5d42009627334b8714a.poster.avif?t=1590849862\" width=580 height=326 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1068990/extras/a849497689afc5d42009627334b8714a.webm?t=1590849862\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1068990/extras/a849497689afc5d42009627334b8714a.mp4?t=1590849862\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>     Another key mechanic is the teleport. By not using the classic portrait view of different spaceshooters you are left with more room in which to move. To traverse this space more quickly or to dodge enemy attacks you can use the teleport. This also takes out a small portion of your energy.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1068990/extras/c3669da9faf13584b54acbc60f30bcdb.poster.avif?t=1590849862\" width=580 height=326 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1068990/extras/c3669da9faf13584b54acbc60f30bcdb.webm?t=1590849862\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1068990/extras/c3669da9faf13584b54acbc60f30bcdb.mp4?t=1590849862\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>     Last but not least, the most clasic mechanic in all spaceshooters, you can shoot down all the enemies on screen by using your ammo.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1068990/extras/b25cb2b132c6b69eae320f7590c7d3f6.poster.avif?t=1590849862\" width=580 height=326 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1068990/extras/b25cb2b132c6b69eae320f7590c7d3f6.webm?t=1590849862\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1068990/extras/b25cb2b132c6b69eae320f7590c7d3f6.mp4?t=1590849862\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>     After you complete a sector you will be rewarded with an upgrade point. You can use these points to upgrade any of the seven different stats. All stats have a three tier progression, the more you want to upgrade it the more points it will cost. These stats are:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>Max Health: Upgrades the maximum health of your ship, but keep in mind that you can only refill it with drops from the enemies.<br>    </li><li>Energy Regen: Your ship continuously regenerates energy. With this stat you can improve how fast this regeneration goes.<br>    </li><li>Max Ammo: The storage for ammunition on the ship is limited.

Your ship will have maxed out upgrades and you will be constantly bombarded by a random assortment of enemies from all three factions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Enemies</h2><br> Because we wanted to make each world feel different we filled them with unique enemies.
