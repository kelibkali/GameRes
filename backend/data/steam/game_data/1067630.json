    "description": "Are you tired of making cars that are easy to get into? tired of making cars that look sensible and are driven by ordinary people? The '<strong>Doors that go like this</strong>' expansion contains everything you need for a billionaires mid-life crisis. Add Scissor doors, Butterfly Doors and Gull-wing doors to the sedan, sports car and the all new gratuitously expensive supercar body style. Enjoy production of the only car body style that looks good in bright orange! find a way to take money from people with way more money than sense! Join in the global trend for monetizing billionaires insecurities with these totally impractical but somehow strangely desirable super-expensive car models. Remember... you are not truly successful in life unless your car has doors that mean you cannot park it anywhere.",
