You play a warrior with a laser gun and have to shoot all monsters. If you touch a monster or get shot by a monster, you die instantly (no health bar, no regeneration). Everything becomes faster and faster. Your goal is to survive as many dungeons as you can. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Multiplayer local, online and mixed</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You can play coop or PvP with up to 4 players. Local multiplayer and online are combinable. For example, you can play together with 2 players on one machine and 2 players on another machine via internet. You can also invite your steam friends or join their lobbies. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Power-Ups</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Collect power-ups within the dungeon.
