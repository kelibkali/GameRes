Wait a little and the image will appear. If the image don't appear, try to restart the Edit Mode, check if the path is correct or delete the previous image.</i><br><br><strong>Q: How i rotate the fluid?</strong><br>A: <i>Once the spawn point is activated and the fluid is ON, click rotate to initiate the rotation and click rotate once more to stop.</i><br><br><strong>Q: Does it have Workshop support?</strong><br>A: <i>The initial release is not covering Workshop. The workshop feature will come in future updates.</i><br><br><strong>Q: My antivirus is detecting malware, why this is happening and what should i do?</strong><br>A: <i>This is a simple app made in Unity Engine, you can add the app to exclusion exception into your antivirus. The flag happens because &quot;Start with Windows&quot; and &quot;Remove from Start&quot; write and remove the app.exe in your Windows Startup folder, so majority of virus scanners will see this as malicious.</i><br><br><br><br>Thank you for checking the application!",
