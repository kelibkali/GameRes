    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Fire Pit</strong> is a game about destroying and burning things.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Pick things up. Drop them into the fire. Watch them disappear. There is no score to chase and nothing to preserve—only the satisfaction that comes when a place has nothing left to offer.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Play alone, or invite friends and throw things together. Every object reacts, breaks down, and ultimately gives in. Different materials behave differently. Some resist longer. None survive. Let the fire do its work.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Each place is a self-contained space, to be destroyed, to be forgotten. When there is nothing left to burn, you are finished there. You may stay, or you may move on to another place that will end the same way.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Fire Pit is deliberate and final. It is not about spectacle, but about certainty. Things go into the fire. They burn.  Nothing is gained. Nothing gets fixed, the life does not get better.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >ALONE OR WITH OTHERS?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You live and die alone. You can throw things into the fire alone too.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >If you have friends, you can bring them and throw things together.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >PLACES</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >There is a shack that should not have been built here. This place belongs to nature, not to people. It was not asking to be occupied. Destroy it. Burn it.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >There is a viewpoint with benches and human trash. Why is it here. People, arrogant enough to claim it, left their mark and moved on. This place was not theirs to take. Get rid of it all.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >There is a beautiful blue house with a white picket fence. A promise of a perfect life. Was your life perfect? Ha. It was a disaster from the start. Destroy this illusion. Burn it down.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >SATISFACTION</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Burn what you find.<br>Leave when there is nothing left.</p>",
