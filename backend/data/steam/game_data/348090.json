It allows heisters to use the Minigun and the Rocket Launcher weapons, the OVERKILL mask as well as a new OVERKILL Escape Van skin. There will be 3 weapon modifications for the Minigun as well as a total 10 extra achievements added. The OVERKILL Pack adds a large amount of Hype Fuel for the Hype Train event with a chance of unlocking additional content for all PAYDAY 2 owners.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/348090/extras/a7acb401c647573b90f1f902b9af681e.avif?t=1756113926\" width=628 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>New Minigun weapon</strong> – The Minigun is a 7.62x51 mm, six-barreled machine gun. The rate of fire is between 2,000 to 6,000 rounds per minute which is crazy. It has Gatling-style rotating barrels with an electric motor as its power source. The &quot;Mini&quot; in the name is in comparison to designs that use a similar firing mechanism but larger shells, which is funny, because the Minigun isn't that mini in reality.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/348090/extras/57df4c3e36a15bdba6b75ef7254b712a.avif?t=1756113926\" width=628 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>3 Minigun weapon mods</strong> – Enjoy customizing the minigun with some really cool weapon modifications.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/348090/extras/9b1b48386166be975767b28c6ae1f9a2.avif?t=1756113926\" width=628 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>New Rocket Launcher weapon</strong> – The Rocket Launcher is a portable, unguided, shoulder-launched, anti-tank rocket-propelled grenade launcher.
