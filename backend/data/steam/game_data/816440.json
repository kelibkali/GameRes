    "description": "Domino Effect is an Over-the-Top, Physics-Based, Independently Made, <br />\r\nAction Game where you possess truly God-like powers and have to think <br />\r\noutside the box in order to track down a missing baby panda that just <br />\r\nmay be the last one on earth....or whatever planet this is....<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere really is no point to this game. Don't expect a story or missions or anything. It's more of a sandbox-style, physics-based tech demo. This is the first game I ever made. I started on it back in 2009 and have finally finished it in the year 2018! That is way too long of a development cycle. I had no end goal. I had no planning. But i just kept going for some reason. After nearly a decade of tinkering around with open-source technology, I have become a much better programmer than when I first started this project. So Domino Effect is kinda like a hybrid of my old and new logic. There are so many grand ideas mashed together in this game that it almost makes it completely incoherent. Basically, this game is the byproduct of myself learning how to be a game developer. So it definitely has its flaws. But if you like to smash stuff and blow it up, then this game is totally for you. This game is unique. Let's leave it at that. I really shouldn't be charging anything more than a dollar for it. So I advise that you get it when it's on sale. Every dollar I make goes to this little studio of mine in my mom's basement. So pick up a copy if you'd like to support, a now much more professional, developer with even greater things to come.
