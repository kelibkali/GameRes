The driving system, though easy to learn, gives the players huge opportunities to use creatively on the maps of all game modes.<br></li><li> Characters and Vehicles - The playable characters are the familiar monsters, known from legends and pop-culture. Each character has its own, unique vehicle with specific parameters and original look.<br></li><li> Original Weapons - A wide arsenal of funny and original weapons, which the monsters shoot at each other to get the upper hand.<br></li><li> Split Screen up to 4 Players - Local multiplayer gaming is coming back! You can sit back and enjoy the game together with your friends and family in front of one screen.<br></li><li> Online Multiplayer -  Each game allows the play for up to 8 players at once.
