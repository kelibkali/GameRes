Easy to play but hard to master, it requires great strategy if you aim for a hi-score while dodging bullets across 12 hand-drawn, steampunk aesthetic stages, set in South America at the end of the 19th century, in an alternate universe.​<br><br>Evorales is inspired by the classic games of the mid-90s but with a Danmaku twist.<br>The first time you play it might seem like a very difficult game, but mastering the Alma and Ultra modes is the key to finishing the game and getting amazing scores.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 12 levels with their respective bosses, plus a hidden level.<br></li><li> On arcade mode you can choose different paths every time.<br></li><li> Different types of damage.

Our villain does not stand out for his wickedness or his power, but for his envy to his neighbors, reaching the point of making a pact with a gnu-demon. It will give him the secret of the Alma technology, which will transform a​ normal army into a powerful gnu-demon force able to defeat its neighbors.<br>However, not everything is lost, since intel has managed to copy and implement this new technology, creating prototypes capables to standing up to the gnu-demon army.<br>Will these prototypes change the course of war?<br>Can you take command of these mighty aircrafts and control the Alma technology?",
