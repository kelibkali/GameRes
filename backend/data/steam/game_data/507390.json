    "description": "Gone In November is a video game which deals with the theme of depression.<br />\r\nGo through the mind and thoughts of a patient who was diagnosed with a deadly disease during his last days of living. A short experience where your choices and your actions don't matter. Texting messages to a social network account that has been inactive for 121 days, have the habit of watering the cacti without any clear reason, fencing your apartment to isolate yourself from the outside world - what else someone can possibly do when they are at their bottom?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Aren't we all puppets and the modern world is what pulling the strings?<br />\r\nIt is tearing us apart.<br />\r\nThe closer we are to each other, the more lonely we feel.&quot;",
