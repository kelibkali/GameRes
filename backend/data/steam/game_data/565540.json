    "description": "The Turkey of Christmas Past is a third person, swordplay orientated, action game about Tom de Cat, master swordsman, and his one cat stand against the Turkey menace. With a fowl army hell bent on destroying Christmas, Tom is our last and only hope. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Turkey of Christmas Past is set in turkey HQ with a zombie like mechanic. Tom must use all of his abilities, including swordplay, ranged attacks, mousetraps, and his inner Felid Power, to prevail. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game features high quality environments and models, motion captured animations, and an original soundtrack. It blends frantic gameplay and epic action with a touch of absurdist humour. Caution: May Contain Turkey",
