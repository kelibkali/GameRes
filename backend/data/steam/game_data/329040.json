Immerse yourself in a fantastic adventure in the lands of Pohe Fakesys and investigate the cause of the returning chaos and darkness.<br><br>At the dawn of the Fourth Age... You, a poor young man struggling to make ends meet, have been summoned by a strange man claiming to be a member of the prestigious Mages’ Guild, to join him on a great quest. In the hope for a better future, you accept his request, for who could refuse to follow such a seemingly eminent member of the Mages’ Guild? A feeling in the back of your mind tells you that this is related to the strange symbol of a moon on you hand... <br><br>Your quest will require you to explore the Dungeon Kingdom world, to uncover hidden treasures, solve puzzles and battle dangerous creatures in many areas, from dark dungeons to stunning temples.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Story Rich:</strong> You won't wander into dungeons without experiencing the epic story.
