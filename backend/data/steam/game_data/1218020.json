To make things more interesting, all robots must program their movements while running based on program line instructions cards available at random on their own programming stack. <br><br>Can you win all the races? Don´t forget to choose your robot model to stand out in the crowd, and also to know which robot is yours. Program, race, win... or be destroyed!<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >CHOOSE YOUR ROBOT!</h2></strong>Choose from twenty different robot models. Complete tasks in the game to unlock the deactivated robots and have all of them at your disposal in this insane factory race. A single player experience but with all the excitement and feel of a multiplayer game!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1218020/extras/fe25338defaa255db2c341a39ceab557.poster.avif?t=1617844481\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1218020/extras/fe25338defaa255db2c341a39ceab557.webm?t=1617844481\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1218020/extras/fe25338defaa255db2c341a39ceab557.mp4?t=1617844481\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >SELECT THE CHALLENGE!</h2></strong>Put your robot to compete in a quick race against other robots or test your skills in a multi-track tournament in different areas of the factory: Foundry, Fabrication and Assembly. Several obstacles are between your robot and the objective points that form the race´s track. All tracks, their obstacles and objectives are procedurally generated. No track is ever the same!<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >RUN!</h2></strong>Run through the factory in two game modes. In programmed game mode your robot has an instruction compiler and executes the movements in sequence. Plan your movements using the available instructions, creating a movement programming sequence. Real time mode allows you to choose the instruction you want your robot to execute right away, but stay tuned as instructions have a cooldown time before they can be used again. Both modes can be played at normal, fast and super-fast speeds.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1218020/extras/b25e737dfc4adfcf66c1843c69e6eb35.poster.avif?t=1617844481\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1218020/extras/b25e737dfc4adfcf66c1843c69e6eb35.webm?t=1617844481\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1218020/extras/b25e737dfc4adfcf66c1843c69e6eb35.mp4?t=1617844481\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >GOAL AND SECRETS!</h2></strong>Use the items distributed in the track to assist you during races.
