    "description": "The Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt, also known as the Nubian Dynasty, was the last dynasty that occurred after the Nubian invasion. The nubians assimilated into society by reaffirming Ancient Egyptian religious traditions, temples, and artistic forms, while introducing some unique aspects of their own culture. It was during this dynasty that the Nile valley saw the first widespread construction of pyramids since the Middle Kingdom. The scans of this mummified man tells us about late Egyptian burial practices, from the placement of his hands to figurines he was buried with.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInside Explorer’s collaboration with Field Museum offers an outstanding immersive way for the public to access unique specimens from the Field’s collections. The Field’s mummies, meteorites, and insects preserved in amber will be released as downloadable content.",
