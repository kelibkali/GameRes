    "description": "RigIT is a 3D computer graphics animation tool that automatically rigs skeletons from an animation library to 3D meshes from 3D mesh libraries. RigIT is a fast, high resolution, near pose, automatic rigger that can rig skeletons to meshes with or without well-defined interiors. It allows you to import skeletons and animations from Motion Capture (.bvh) files and automatically rigs them to objects imported from Wavefront (.obj) files that contain a single object mesh.  These rigged meshes can then be exported to a Collada (.dae) file.  RigIT is designed to decrease time to market costs by reducing the time requirement for, and simplifying the process of, assigning animations to computer graphics. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSystem requirements: <br />\r\nOperating system: Windows 7 or later<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey product features: <br />\r\nAutomatic rigging of skeletons to meshes <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo see tutorials on how to use RigIT see: <br />\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIiRDJPsojFIja_cDgUwjQw<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor more information see our website: <br />\r\nhttp://www.rigitgraphics.com/ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo download Blender for free visit: <br />\r\nhttp://www.blender.org/",
