    "description": "The game is based on high-impact combat. A playable character traverses land and fights a swarm of enemies. In order to move on in the game, the player needs to defeat enemies to exit and enter parts of a level.<br />\r\nDefeating enemies gives a base score per enemy defeated. Combo attacks provide a multiplier score for the enemy defeated. Harder combos also add higher scores. Pickups in the game also add to the player score. At the end of levels, the player is given awards based on the amount scored.<br />\r\nThe game has many different special moves that can be used while fighting hordes of enemies to clear them out faster and can instantly kill enemies, it will also play a cut scene before activation or until completed.",
