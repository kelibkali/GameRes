Choose what items to showcase, draw in the crowds, and grow your collection of cultural, artistic, historical, and scientific displays to expand from a humble exhibit hall into a world-class institution! This isn't your average museum. This is <strong>Mondo Museum</strong>.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1093820/extras/c6bc90defb378d5ec24ca5616f41f795.poster.avif?t=1701458417\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1093820/extras/c6bc90defb378d5ec24ca5616f41f795.webm?t=1701458417\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1093820/extras/c6bc90defb378d5ec24ca5616f41f795.mp4?t=1701458417\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Construct a Museum: </strong>Create your own unique layout by placing exhibit halls, gift shops, theatres, and more. Then customize the look of each room with different floors, wallpapers, windows, and decor. But plan carefully… wouldn’t want to get lost in your own museum.<br></li><li><strong>Choose Your Exhibits:</strong> Mix-and-match 100+ items across multiple collections, from Dinosaurs to Space Exploration. As your museum gains prestige, you’ll unlock new artifacts from around the world to play with.<br></li><li><strong>Put Your Creativity on Display:</strong> Dive into an accessible modding system to create your own exhibit items to share on the Steam Workshop. Or download collections made by other players to spice up your museum. </li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Keep Calm and Curate On:</strong> Stay on your toes because you never know situations you might encounter. Meet the demands of a visiting VIP and they might loan you a rare exhibit, but keep an eye on that shaky-looking dinosaur skeleton...<br></li><li><strong>Manage Your People:</strong> Attract visitors, address their comfort, make sure they exit through the gift shop (cha-ching), and manage their experience for maximum prestige and profit! Hire staff like researchers, conservators, and docents; they’ll keep your displays informative and, more importantly, intact.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1093820/extras/31a05dbb46c9c6eda45c2b58885197c7.poster.avif?t=1701458417\" width=600 height=214 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1093820/extras/31a05dbb46c9c6eda45c2b58885197c7.webm?t=1701458417\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1093820/extras/31a05dbb46c9c6eda45c2b58885197c7.mp4?t=1701458417\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Exhibit Collections</h2>As your museum gains international renown, other institutions will agree to loan you new and increasingly rare items for display. Some of the collections include:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Dinosaurs:</strong> Features classic fossils and the imposing skeletons of dinos like T. rex, Triceratops, and Velociraptor, along with the latest research into their lives (spoiler: they go extinct).<br></li><li><strong>Ancient Egypt: </strong>An introductory collection from the Nile civilization that spanned three thousand years. King Tut’s riches, Khufu’s great pyramid, and Queen Hatsheput’s monuments, plus items from the daily life of common people.<br></li><li><strong>Space Exploration:</strong> Follow the progress of international space exploration from Sputnik 1 to the present day. Showcase a wide variety of spacecraft and equipment from the Moon, Mars, and beyond (like those gold LPs we sent to E.T.)!<br></li><li><strong>Much More:</strong> We have lots of other ideas for collections for when the game launches in Early Access! Different cultures, historical periods, art forms... there's a lot to choose from. Stay tuned for more updates on these and more in the coming months.</li></ul><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1093820/extras/daaf00cb71309617c5a65aaba6821868.poster.avif?t=1701458417\" width=600 height=128 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1093820/extras/daaf00cb71309617c5a65aaba6821868.webm?t=1701458417\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span></li></ul>",
