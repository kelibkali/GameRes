    "description": "9 new in-game music tracks to enhance Flatspace IIk. Like any in-game music for Flatspace, these will trigger at random when you enter a new sector.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first, original music pack was created in 2005, and included a mix of unused game music, such as the epic theme to The Heart of Aorkhan, and some tracks from my solo albums up until that time, such as a track from the first version of The Spiral Staircase. I'm now a full time artist and my music has changed considerably since 2005, so I wanted to include some recent music, as well as the best quality versions of those original tracks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack includes a full description of the music as a pdf booklet. Here is an outline of the music included:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Heart of Aorkhan: Main Theme<br />\r\nCreated using the first generation of my music software, Noise Station, in 2001, this was the main theme for a massive 3D rogue-like game that didn't make it to final release.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCatacombs<br />\r\nThis was part of The Heart of Aorkhan soundtrack.
