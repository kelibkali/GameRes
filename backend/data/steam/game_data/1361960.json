    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >  Referee's Briefing 2: Anomalies and Wonders</h2>Much of the time Travellers move from one starport to the next, seeing the shops and the bars and not much else. In between they stare at the same six bulkheads and watch old movies, or sit around in the galley chatting. Some of them have more to talk about than others; tales of adventure and daring that might just possibly be true. And every now and then the conversation turns to the wonders of Charted Space... the amazing places and strange sights that await those who dare to visit them. Some of these anomalies and wonders are mythical, some are known to be real, and some are not quite either of those. Anomalies and<br><strong>  Wonders is a guide to some of those wondrous places. It will give Travellers something to talk about for years to come.<br>Once in a while a group of Travellers might raise their eyes above the endless cycle of mortgage payments on their ship or out of the murk of the local criminal underworld.<br>They might see something truly amazing if they do.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i></strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Traveller 2E (Mongoose) ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
