    "description": "The purpose of this simulation is to treat clients with a fear of open spaces – popularly known as Agoraphobia. It's worth noting that agoraphobia is a general fear that emerges when one's surroundings make it &quot;difficult to escape&quot;. A city square or plaza, therefore, is an (in)famous example of this. A person suffering agoraphobia may find this environment overwhelming, and feels the need to stay close to walls or other objects as a means of emotional support.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis VR-simulation takes place in the middle of a city. The therapist can control multiple options. They can set the time of day, the amount of fog, the presence of pedestrians, even the height of the city’s buildings, and they can teleport the client to specific locations of interest. The Oculus Touch controls can be used by either the therapist or the client to navigate around the city. However, this can lead to motion sickness. This simulation also comes with measures that prevent motion sickness.",
