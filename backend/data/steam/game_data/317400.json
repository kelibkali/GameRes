When she finally wakes, there is a fake Cave Johnson telling her she needs to escape the facility and a new device called the Aperture Handheld Portal Device, her mind races with questions. “Who is this imposter Cave Johnson?” “What happened to the facility and its staff?”<br><br>&quot;What happened to me?&quot; <br><br>Main Features <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>22 levels, with an estimated gameplay time of ~6-10 hours<br></li><li>Custom Story with 350 separate in-game voicelines<br></li><li>Over an hour of custom music with the Free soundtrack included<br></li><li>Huge amount of custom assets<br></li><li>27 steam achievements<br></li><li>Standalone mod (You do not need Portal 2 installed to play)<br></li><li>Free to Play (You must own Portal 2)<br></li><li>Logic based puzzles, not execution based puzzles</li></ul><br>FAQ:<br><br><strong>How do I play this game?</strong><br>Go to the steam store page  and click the &quot;Play Game&quot; button.<br><br><strong>Why is this game not available in ?</strong><br>The translation for our mod has been done by volunteers only.
