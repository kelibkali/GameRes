    "description": "All the people of Gnomeland were preparing for a double celebration – Christmas alongside the triumphant coronation of the princess. Preparations marched on day and night in the castle courtyard. A troll lived nearby, and the constant sawing and hammering disturbed his rest. Angered, he and his henchmen stole the Christmas tree. The old gnome Elvenar brought this news to the princess while she was sipping lemonade and redesigning the landscape to make it look more Christmassy. <br />\r\n“What do you think, Elvenar, should I redesign the garden, or should I focus more on the main square? On the one hand the townspeople can have picnics with their neighbors in the garden, neighborhood games, walk their dogs, and I’d be able to go there with my pussy cat. On the other hand, the main party will be in the square...”<br />\r\n“Your highness, about that – the people are greatly disturbed by the theft of the main Christmas tree and all the gifts from the square!”<br />\r\n“What!?
