    "description": "To achieve any goal, the algorithm was always required. <br />\r\nArtificial intelligence in the robot first analyzes the test, then builds an algorithm to overcome it. After all this, it is ready to move on. <br />\r\nStep by step, create a path from the &quot; traces&quot; to the finish to pass to the next test. <br />\r\nYou have to enter the exciting world of intellectual tasks, which have no known solution algorithm. Will you be able to create an algorithm from scratch and to pass all tests?<br />\r\nTry to pass all levels - from the simplest to the most difficult.",
