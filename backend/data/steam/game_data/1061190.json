    "description": "This package includes the Grimshade original soundtrack.<br><br>Grimshade’s atmospheric music score was written by the talented musician and composer Ivan Chimaer Galchenko. He roamed the shadows of Ree'Fah together with the darkest creatures that lurk there in search of inspiration for the game's soundtrack. <br><br>Ivan, one of our first active social media subscribers, answered our call when we began searching for a composer. He brought in a rough mix of a tune he had composed to his first interview at the studio, taking inspiration from screenshots, art, and game descriptions as well as narrative texts from our community page. The original tune was refined and has become the main theme of the Grimshade score.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Track List</h2>01 Main menu theme<br>02 This is how it started<br>03 Deep in the Brann forest<br>04 Sewers<br>05 War theme<br>06 Charlie’s tavern<br>07 Kiba’s Nightmare<br>08 High Brann<br>09 Brann combat theme<br>10 Victory<br>11 Dragon dTick<br>12 Lower Brann<br>13 Shadows in Brann<br>14 Shalla<br>15 Alchemists combat theme<br>16 Try again<br>17 Escape from Brann<br>18 Wailing Horror<br>19 Take that, stump<br>20 Southern Swamps<br>21 Lillypond theme<br>22 Prepare to fight<br>23 Swamp combat theme<br>24 Far Marshes<br>25 Arthu combat theme<br>26 This is not the end<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >CREDITS</h2><strong>Composer </strong><br>Ivan Chimaer Galchenko<br><br><strong>Musicians </strong><br>Maria Capparo, Olga LaaliCapparo Koshevaya, Irina Tolmacheva",
