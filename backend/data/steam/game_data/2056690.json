    "description": "Camp Laughter is a low-poly, first-person, horror-comedy game about escaping a killer infested campground that was made in 6-months by a small group of horror-loving students at UCSC as our final capstone project.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this game you control Sammy, a young teenager who has come to Camp Laughter for the Summer. You have no hope of harming these dangerous killers, so instead you'll need to sneak around, search for important items, and run for your life!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCan you evade all the colorful killers, solve the campground's puzzles, and manage to escape in one piece?",
