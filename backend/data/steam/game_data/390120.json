    "description": "This game was developed by Fancy Fish Games. Originally, the project idea was for the game jam PewDiePie vs Indies last year back in October.  Although we finished on time, we broke one of the game jam rules and decided it would not be fair to submit since we did not comply with the criteria.<br><br>I had no idea how to approach this kind of game where you can combine words and do random things that are ridiculous. However, I knew I wanted to compose something thematic and light. Fancy Fish Games decided they wanted to go with an Orchestral sound that exhibits a fun, quirky, and ADventurous (like that pun?) mood for the player to enjoy as they fill in the blanks and solve the puzzle on this point and click game.<br><br>Writing for random words and objects was very challenging but I focused on theme and the environment. I imagined that I was child and I was personifying each character. I asked myself, what were their quarrels, wants, needs and overall resolutions?  I woke up every morning before work and composed a little bit for every track until I felt I captured the essence and environment.  Thus, the Adventure Lib Original Soundtrack was born. <br>I hope you enjoy the game and the soundtrack and thank you so much for your support.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Tracks Included:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Throne Room (02:12 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>Outside Castle Walls (03:25 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>The Dungeon Below (02:30 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>Town Square (02:18 mp3 128kbps)</li></ul><br>Music Composed, Arranged and Produced by Chase Bethea : <br><br>Mastered by Ken Jacobsen @ Ken Jacobsen Music : <br><br>Album Art by Michael Muranaka @ ",
