    "description": "They have HORNS is a fast topdown shooter in which it is essential to listen to his intuition in order to stand as long as possible the enemy hordes. Easy to learn, but hard to master. The up to 4 player coop mode works very simple via plugn play.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat differentiates my game mainly from the other thousand Twinstick TopDown Horde Shooter: The opponents are difficult to circumvent through the narrower premises and also the AI ​​which tries to cut the way leads to the direct confrontation. If you do not deal with your abilities properly and keep a cool head despite the high speed, the battle will not win for you.",
