Like every mentally unstable person, this experiment also has to struggle with mental problems. The effect expresses the disturbed psyche of our main character. The suffering. The paranoia.

Unlike other games which suddenly introduce you to two (or multiple) decisions, our game warns you of an upcoming butterfly effect. It's like in real life: No decision possibility, decisions out of your gut, decisions can't be undone. Sometimes there are more than two decisions. Even small ones can have a huge impact through the game.<br><br>If a butterfly effect occurs, you will recognize it by butterflies appearing around the character. The more butterflies, the more aggressive the effect.<br><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1448670/extras/2493c2b31b3f1e15ee15fd32735f77e6.poster.avif?t=1621193042\" width=680 height=382 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1448670/extras/2493c2b31b3f1e15ee15fd32735f77e6.webm?t=1621193042\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1448670/extras/2493c2b31b3f1e15ee15fd32735f77e6.mp4?t=1621193042\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1448670/extras/c492c09455354aace3780b3c023bdb42.poster.avif?t=1621193042\" width=680 height=382 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1448670/extras/c492c09455354aace3780b3c023bdb42.webm?t=1621193042\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1448670/extras/c492c09455354aace3780b3c023bdb42.mp4?t=1621193042\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Another element that differs from other 2D platformers is our inventory system. Through the course of the game you will always find useful things that will help you to solve puzzles or to overcome dangers. Some objects are useless in their individuality but very valuable together with others.<br><br>Also untypical for this kind of game, is the way you interact with weapons, movable objects and objects that move on their own.",
