It involved a two-pronged attack. One along the Axis right flank driving to the Caucasus and the vital oil fields of Baku, and the other against the left flank in the direction of Stalingrad and the Volga River. The battle would rage for 2 months over several hundred square kilometers that would take the German Army to the gates of Stalingrad itself. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1566190/extras/1a2a8b98140c7f3c67990f23ca0195b1.avif?t=1643624417\" width=616 height=140 /></span><br>Heroes of the Bitter Harvest is a module for the Lock 'n Load Tactical series.
