    "description": "Gretta finds something alluringly beautiful, yet horrendously terrible​ hidden deep within her apartment. It grows beneath the floorboards. Will it bring her happiness, or sink her into despair?<br><br>This is a small scale experience set in a few rooms that should last 40-60 minutes, but things are continually changing. Made to be played in one session, with a focus on exploration, atmosphere and a story about raising a disgusting child. What horrors await within the confines of what Gretta calls home?<br><br>*<i>To launch the game from Steam, launch the game from your Library rather than your recently updated games. That will give you an option to launch the base game or the &quot;Bruises Glimmer in Starlight&quot; DLC.</i>",
