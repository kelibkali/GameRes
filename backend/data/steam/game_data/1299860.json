It's also strangely relaxing and quite funny. The gameplay is extremely complex: Get 10 hoops and head to the next level. Overwhelming, suffocating yet dazzling. Hoops give you shields, shields let you smash, smashing leads to hoops. Oh no, I've said too much, I haven't said enough. Can you stay calm in a hurricane? <strong>Endlight is for you.</strong> Does a slight breeze instill fear? <strong>Endlight also for you.</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1299860/extras/9a01c4e702f62fe4905da3e193441bbb.poster.avif?t=1768755504\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1299860/extras/9a01c4e702f62fe4905da3e193441bbb.webm?t=1768755504\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1299860/extras/9a01c4e702f62fe4905da3e193441bbb.mp4?t=1768755504\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><strong>Endlight levels CANNOT be replayed, they can't even be selected.</strong><br>It's 2025, who wants choices that don't matter? <strong>Not you.</strong> Endlight shipped with 4 seasons, followed by 16 seasons of <strong>FREE</strong> DLC. Season 20, the final season of Endlight, just released (Sept 2025). Endlight now has 650+ levels which take 40+ hours to complete (minimum). That's a <strong>lot</strong> of Endlight, and no-one yet has seen it all. Should you reach the end, and by golly there is an end (infinite runners are for the damned), the rewards are <strong>unspeakable</strong>.<br><br><strong>&quot;The Right To Replay&quot; Challenge</strong><br>Every year on December 9, Endlight features a <strong>once-a-year one-day-only one-chance-only</strong> challenge where you can finally earn &quot;The Right To Replay&quot;. Simply open Endlight anytime that day and you'll receive a special challenge. Should you beat that challenge (people have!), you will win a coupon to replay the game. Otherwise you'll need to wait <strong>another year</strong> to try again. Worth noting every year is different, and they're all terribly terribly unfair. &quot;Cancel Christmas momma, we already got our present!&quot;<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1299860/extras/d0fbea0b9f9f2b08a051a2d120d158f7.poster.avif?t=1768755504\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1299860/extras/d0fbea0b9f9f2b08a051a2d120d158f7.webm?t=1768755504\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1299860/extras/d0fbea0b9f9f2b08a051a2d120d158f7.mp4?t=1768755504\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><strong>But Wait, There's MORE!</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Hand crafted procedural generation<br></li><li> 1 Player   30,000 particles   120,000 cubes<br></li><li> 650+ levels   40+ hours playtime   0 friction<br></li><li> 4K   120+fps   Multi-Threaded<br></li><li> Incredible on SteamDeck (60fps with most effects, 30fps with everything)<br></li><li> Everything moves, everything rotates, everything intimidates<br></li><li> Spectacular first person &quot;Outside&quot; levels (see video)<br></li><li> Can't be replayed<br></li><li> &quot;Surprise Chats&quot; featuring the worst story in videogame history<br></li><li> <strong>The Unstuck Guarantee™</strong> - struggling to complete a level? we <strong>discard</strong> it!<br></li><li> Ultra streamlined user interface - you can't even choose levels<br></li><li> Supports controllers, keyboard + mouse, mouse only, and keyboard only (OG Doom 4Evah)<br></li><li> Tweak everything including FOV, chaos, difficulty, performance, flashing<br></li><li> Everything has been sacrificed to fill your screen - there are no empty spaces<br></li><li> Never gets faster, only denser (like you)<br></li><li> Not a game, <strong>an assault</strong><br></li><li> You'll Learn Nothing</li></ul>",
