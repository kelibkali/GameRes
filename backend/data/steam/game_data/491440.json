I really wanted a game where I could be a dragon. Most dragon games aren't really about the dragons at all. They're about ... people ... that's right. And people aren't dragons, are they? It's time to have a new dragon game that's about, you know: DRAGONS!<br><br><strong><i>What are real dragons like?</i></strong><br>They're not your pets... or your animal friends. They're wild, majestic, ferocious forces of nature. But, they're not mindless. No - they're very smart... and clever... (well... sometimes.) Real dragons have character, personality, depth. You could even say there's a little human in every dragon. ( ... or maybe that depends on their diet.)<br><br><strong><i>Why should you get this game?</i></strong><br>Well... if you want to be a dragon - you should totally get it!<br><br>Please, don't lose this chance to eat absolutely everyone!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491440/extras/b62c55acfc1916833b5195745c58a1d9.avif?t=1491839770\" width=128 height=128 /></span>",
