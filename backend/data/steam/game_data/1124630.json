Discover how, and, perhaps more importantly, why this murderous individual leaves behind gruesome calling cards, as well as his ultimate reasoning for the murders. After all, the premise may just hide more than it would seem at face value.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1124630/extras/aebf6d5dab1cb77c718ca3d758129749.avif?t=1566236241\" width=600 height=118 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>A motivation for murder</strong> <br>Discover who is behind a series of recent murders, as well as the killer’s unusual reason for committing said murders.<br></li><li><strong>More than a single ending</strong> <br>Info in a murder case comes from multiple sources, so why should there only be one ending? Piece together the whole story by choosing different options as the game progresses.<br></li><li><strong>Snap out of it</strong> <br>Detective Greenhill doesn’t carry a notebook – because that would be far too convenient. He does, however, have his trusty camera, which can come in handy at certain points.<br></li><li><strong>School’s back to haunt you</strong> <br>If you thought math class was scary, how about encountering some visitors of the long dead variety? Just so you know, they aren’t too fond of getting their picture taken.</li></ul><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1124630/extras/6db71b95c868bac67fd971263ce61da7.avif?t=1566236241\" width=600 height=262 /></span><br>Depending on how you choose to approach the investigation, you’ll explore different locations in the pursuit for clues of what’s ultimately going on.
