    "description": "Burning Out.This is a game about a small village whose inhabitants are partially infected with an unknown infection. Your task is to smoke tenants from their houses in order to separate healthy people from patients.<br />\r\nAll the tenants, leaving the burning houses, rush to the well in the center of the village. The healthy tenants increase the population, while those infected in front of them reduce the population. And helping you in the treatment of all this is your flamethrower.<br />\r\nUse standart WASD controls to move, and left mouse button to fire. Burning some healthy inhabitants may cause the rain, wich can put out the fire. Main goal is to increase overall population to 10.000",
