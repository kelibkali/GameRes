You can stick to the basics and upgrade your bumpers, wheels, wings, lights and paint. If you are feeling you want more, you can take advantage of the advanced customization features within Jidousha Shakai and modify hoods, roof, windows, grills, tires, engine, exhaust, <strong>and much, much more</strong>. Literally every inch of your cars look and performance is at your fingertips to make something truly <strong>unique</strong>.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1414870/extras/72f86e4c0d19c98143a5817a5456fda8.avif?t=1631459719\" width=600 height=80 /></span><br><br>The physics and simulation in Jidousha Shakai are meant to provide a realistic but fun driving experience. There are no scripted events or hand holding when it comes to driving. Because the simulation is accurate, you can upgrade your car as you see fit and it will perform how you would expect. Your engine will stall if you don't clutch correctly while driving a manual transmission car. Your differential choice plays a big part in how your car over-steers. Your engine is physically modeled after real world data and you have access to everything by using the advanced &quot;chip tuning&quot; system to set your engines rev limit, fuel ratio, and much more. All of this is accurately simulated without taking away the fun factor that is lacking in other driving simulators.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1414870/extras/2ded703f976e1037a5883ac797dad201.avif?t=1631459719\" width=600 height=80 /></span><br><br>Take your fully customized car on to one of the many hand crafted open world maps. Explore hot spots from your world map that include meet spots, drift spots, drag spots, speed challenges, and time trials. The open world can be fully autonomous or you can have full control over the traffic density, the time of day, weather, and many more options that affect the world.",
