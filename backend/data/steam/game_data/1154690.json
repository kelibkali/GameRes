A beautiful midsummer night in the tiny northern fishing village Måsnes, Leif wakes up and remembers his dreams for the first time in many years. Is there a connection between his dreams and the real world?<br><br>Step into the life of Leif - the world’s least impressive video game hero - who may not even have the power to step out of bed. Explore his tiny comfort zone and use lucid dreaming to reach deep into his subconscious to find a spark of life - or perhaps a final nightmarish madness.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1154690/extras/be05ba703167091a0a510491ba47ec92.poster.avif?t=1667763011\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1154690/extras/be05ba703167091a0a510491ba47ec92.webm?t=1667763011\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1154690/extras/be05ba703167091a0a510491ba47ec92.mp4?t=1667763011\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>For anyone from experienced gamers to those fresh to the genre and even those new to gaming altogether - the point &amp; click adventure is a time honored genre that is both accessible and engaging.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1154690/extras/097123f5ff84892d860342fd5053162f.poster.avif?t=1667763011\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1154690/extras/097123f5ff84892d860342fd5053162f.webm?t=1667763011\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1154690/extras/097123f5ff84892d860342fd5053162f.mp4?t=1667763011\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>This Arctic, Nordic and Sámi story is told with dedication by a team of experienced developers from award winning games such as <i>Firewatch</i>, <i>The Longest Journey</i>, <i>Anarchy Online</i>, <i>Age of Conan</i> and <i>Trolls vs. Vikings</i> with a passion for the project.
