    "description": "Build your way to collect Brinko's lost coins and help him reunite with his friend Kobo.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About the game: </h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Brinko is a multi layered platformer, you can go far or come near apart from the traditional 2D movements.<br><br></li><li> The game focuses on traditional Disney style artwork and is aimed for both young and older audience. The game quickly becomes difficult and requires you to plan properly to finish each day.<br><br></li><li> I hope to create regular 30 minute episodes for the game to create a more TV series like experience rather than one massive game. So you can follow the season or any single episode. Newer episodes would be on the same steam title.<br><br></li><li> For information regarding the full game, please visit: </li></ul>",
