This collection of playable novels is inspired by real events and places—but the course of each journey depends on your choices.</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1051410/extras/00ce9568ccbd856e77aac4b2c419608f.avif?t=1724948951\" width=624 height=80 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>A bridge between literature and gaming</strong></h2>Wanderlust: Travel Stories is a book that you shape. If you’re seeking something a little bit different it is for you—and if you can read this, you have all you need to get started.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>An anthology of travel stories</strong></h2>Four long stories and five short ones, each written by its own team of authors. Every journey offers a unique playstyle as you experience travel through the eyes of distinct individuals. Like an idealistic student, a jaded reporter, or a man who’s simply a terrible planner.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Authentic, grounded and well researched</strong></h2>Inspired by true stories and set in real places. Travel to the mysterious statues of Rapa Nui, bustling streets of Bangkok, pristine expanses of the Antarctic, grasslands of the Serengeti, and more. Dive into tales created by passionate travelers and experienced reporters, see the world they saw throughout their journeys.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Emotions color perception</strong></h2>Your choices shape the characters’ mood. This, in turn, changes how you see the world. All emotions are valid: happiness or enthusiasm aren’t everything, feeling sad or fatigued is perfectly natural.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Minimalism</strong></h2>Tasteful aesthetic, bespoke photography, and immersive soundscapes set the tone. Just enough to stir your own memories or feed the imagination.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Introducing Slow Gaming</strong></h2>Like a peaceful afternoon with a cup of tea and a novel, it’s a slow-paced and meditative experience. You don’t have to rush or fight, you can take in every moment at your own pace. If this is what you seek, check out our Slow Gaming Manifesto.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>From the creators of The Witcher, Dying Light and Hitman</strong></h2>We sail into uncharted waters with this experimental playable travel documentary.
