    "description": "In 8 well structured sections with 51 short videos you will get a complete introduction and video reference guide to Blender and how to create game assets.<br>The training series will end with importing a hat game asset into Team Fortress 2.<br><br>In the first section all the basic knowledge will be built up to begin modeling in Blender. From there it's full steam ahead on making a Team Fortress game asset, where additional topics are explored in many 10 minute chapters - so you can just come in and browse the section on 'baking normals' or 'setting up for 3d painting' or 'exporting into Team Fortress 2' or 'an introduction to uv's'. Or you can watch the whole series sequentially as a training session to master Blender in general.<br><br>Author Aidy Burrows lives in Manchester UK and has worked for large games companies on next-gen titles titles such as Lord of the Rings and Lego Marvel. He's been trained with 3ds Max and Maya but now uses Blender for his work as well. Currently he's working as part of the CGMasters team to produce free high quality training material.<br><br>NOTE: the associated Blender files will be in a ZIP archive in the Software catalog of the Steam client.<br><br>This video tutorial was produced by Blender Institute.
