Feel free to purchase this version for the original experience, or play the new version for free!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898940/extras/bcc2d6f85c96fc6b49048cab2f89e130.avif?t=1680522697\" width=512 height=128 /></span><br><i>VirtuaCreature</i> is a monster care simulation highly influenced by the creature-craze of the past. You'll be responsible for all facets of your creature, and the effort you put in will reflect in how it grows. <strong>From baby to beast - it's in your hands!</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898940/extras/f62b1720ac2b3ffbfee8f8c322744956.avif?t=1680522697\" width=512 height=128 /></span><br>Everything you do influences the growth and evolution of your monster. Create a balance between different activities and healthy feeding habits, and you will have a balanced creature. Abuse the same activity or item too hard, and it will develop <strong>high strengths</strong> - and <strong>extreme weaknesses</strong>.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898940/extras/3be091f1ad5412779f72d015882c975f.avif?t=1680522697\" width=512 height=128 /></span><br>Play multiple unique <strong>minigames</strong> to discipline your creature - Will you train it to physical peak, or give it a more playful attitude?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898940/extras/8157cb97d0d13918bb0d0e32e6d018ac.avif?t=1680522697\" width=512 height=128 /></span><br>Purchase and combine <strong>ingredients</strong> to make various different <strong>stat-boosting items</strong>. Keep track with an in-game recipe book, and craft accordingly to your needs!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898940/extras/f654283a83f2465ebc4466347504bf43.avif?t=1680522697\" width=512 height=128 /></span><br>Everything needs food, and your creature is no exception! Every activity you do while playing drains its hunger in small increments, and you'll need to feed it in-between strenuous activities or risk it getting unhappy. While you're gone, its hunger will drain slowly in <strong>real time</strong> - so make sure you come back and check on it before too long!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898940/extras/f88198dfc64e745f3a048a1520e56519.avif?t=1680522697\" width=512 height=128 /></span><br>Make your creature even stronger through <strong>special equipment</strong>, obtainable either directly or through special chests - <i>And no, that doesn't mean paid lootboxes</i>. Each piece of equipment has a different type, power level and color, so you'll have to match it best to your beast!<br><br>Clear timer-based nodes in the <strong>Void Mine</strong> to obtain chests, money or <i>Synths</i>, a special item that can be used to level up your equipment to be even stronger! As you clear nodes, your &quot;<i>Drill Level</i>&quot; will increase, giving you access to better loot pools than before!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898940/extras/fccdd22ae019a4da88bcb2378f49a25e.avif?t=1680522697\" width=512 height=128 /></span><br><strong>Multiple Battle Systems!</strong> Compete in breakneck-paced <strong>Arenas</strong> where every second counts - Each enemy prefers one of four &quot;<i>battle stances</i>&quot;, and you'll have to learn which to use yourself to effectively combat it. Push your stats as high as possible to earn an edge over the competition!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Different arena types for each tier of evolution!</strong><br></li><li><strong>Multiple difficulties for each type!</strong><br></li><li><strong>&quot;Infinite&quot; arena with increasing scaled difficulty and rewards.

With over 20 unique designs, your play-through can have tons of variety.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Your Creature Awaits!</h2>",
