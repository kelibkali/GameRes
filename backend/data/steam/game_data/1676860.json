Give interviews, participate in TV shows, and read about your last game in the newspaper. Find the right agent to optimize your career.<br><br>But your personal life matters too. Do you want to get married, have children, and become a homeowner, or do you prefer a sports car? Will you risk it all at the casino, or slowly save your salary? Invest in stocks from various sectors and monitor their performance, or do you want to put your money into more speculative ventures? The decisions are yours alone to make. Sign endorsement deals and boost your popularity on social media through appropriate actions. Move to other teams and employ your personal fitness or mental coach.<br><br>Be careful not to fall in with the wrong crowd or get too distracted from football.<br><br>Win the favor of the national coach and participate in World and European Championships. Play with your favorite club in national and international cup and league matches. The game covers all major competitions.<br><br>In the game, do you want to dive, play for the team, or focus more on your personal success? Passing or shooting, time-wasting or counterattacking, playing on the offside line or provoking the opponent – it's all in your hands!<br><br>In addition to your career, with Goalgetter, you can also replay historic World Cup tournaments. Play as a striker in the 2022 World Cup, or do you want to experience the Miracle of Bern in 1954?
