It showcases sprites, concept art, and procedures we took in making Speedlimit as is presented to you in the game. Pixelart may be a tried and true method-turn-style, but we think we still found something to learn from it in making this game. You can see the behind the scene tricks we used to make Speed Limit feel the way it does.",
