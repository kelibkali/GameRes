    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >1. This unique war game lets you command a mix of maneuver and combat support units that you can assemble into combined-arms battle groups. Build these around a core of infantry and armor, and reinforce them with combat support elements like anti-tank or engineer platoons. Then command them across battlefields where you must synchronize maneuver and fire, and plan for ammunition replenishment, in order to defeat an enemy who fights according to tactically-sound battle plans. Fight historical scenarios or use an editor to design your own offensive or defensive battles where you can go for an easy day by crushing a mass of early-war light tanks with King Tigers, or challenge yourself to stop a flood of Soviet armor with nothing but infantry and anti-tank guns. DLCs add additional battles and operations, as well as logistics and headquarters elements.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >2.
