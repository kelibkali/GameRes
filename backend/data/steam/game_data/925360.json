    "description": "In Ape Hit, players will step into virtual reality and take on the role of a newly hired Wrecking Ball Crane Operator. Demolition hungry players will be able to smash their way around 5 virtual job sites with each map packed full of wacky power-ups and destructible buildings. Take care to avoid any buildings outside of the job’s scope or your boss, an angry ape, will be furious!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers will utilize 3 levers in an attempt to demolish multiple structures within each level. As players earn cold hard cash for the company power-ups will spawn including the highly coveted, giant Megaball! Once satisfied with the destruction, players can end their shift and move forward to the next work site. Should things go poorly on site there is always the PANIC! button...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nApe Hit was developed using the Unreal Engine 4 and is built for the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Windows Mixed Reality VR devices.",
