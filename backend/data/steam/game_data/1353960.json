    "description": "Along with the game, please support our talented composer by downloading Servants of Harvest Wish's original soundtrack featuring 22 wonderfully composed Touhou-style themes. This game's music mainly focuses on showing off the beauty of Japanese instruments, but some tracks experiment with a modern feel as well -- needless to say, there's something for everyone. If you're a follower of Inari, listening to this soundtrack while farming is highly recommended.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMain Soundtrack Composer: DJ Abner<br />\r\nMikuzume's Mind Game (Mastermind Version) Composer: Naudiz",
