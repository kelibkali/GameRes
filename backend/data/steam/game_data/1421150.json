The shadow of the Whitechapel Murderer looms over London.</h2><br>Eddy Nichols, the eldest son of the first acknowledged victim, arrives at Whitechapel in search of answers. What he finds, though, is a panic-stricken city and a number of people eager to make the most of the horrible crimes: an American private eye, thirsty for fame and glory; the owner of an awful tabloid; a psychiatrist who advocates for suspicious, questionable methods, and an elusive, mentally unstable journalist.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Experience the investigation surrounding the Jack the Ripper crimes putting yourself on the shoes of one of the protagonists in this thrilling mystery Visual Novel!:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Around 50k words of mystery and romance.<br></li><li>Two (optional) LGBT love interests.<br></li><li>Three suspects.<br></li><li>Three endings, depending on your choices.<br></li><li>A gripping original soundtrack.</li></ul> <br><strong>DISCLAIMERS:</strong> <i>This story is based on well-known true facts, and most of the characters are inspired by real people.
