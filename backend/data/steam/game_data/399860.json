    "description": "The action takes place in a new area of ​​operations in the flood plain of the Shatt al-Arab river during the Iran-Iraq war. Two operations for Iranian and Iraqi armies, and a single mission are available to the player. Pontoon bridges, floating armored vehicles, and Iranian-produced UCAVs are widely used during the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the end of December 1986, Iranian forces launched the next operation - Karbala-4. IRGC frogmen crossed the Shatt al-Arab river and captured a number of the border islands, as well as a bridgehead on the right bank. Then, pontoon bridges were assembled across the river, which lightly armed Basij militia units of the &quot;Prophet Muhammad&quot; division used to cross to the right river bank and began an offensive in the general direction of Basra.",
