    "description": "Welcome to the demo for BIRBOUT! This demo is of an incomplete build of the final game. In this demo, you'll have access to 5 levels and 7 weapons from the full game. See you then!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSunny doesn't play like a traditional run and gun, almost all weapons are burst-damage weapons, with no automatics. Customise Sunny's loadout using 'Your Loadout' on the pause menu to change which weapons are equipped next life, and tackle any challenge the game throws at you any way you choose. Before you start unlocking weapons, the majority of enemies will be using exact copies of them in the level. Once you know how to play against a weapon, you can play with the weapon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEating seeds heals you, which drop from enemies or are found in secret mini-screens. Permanent weapon pickups are at the end of each stage, and you can use Warp Nests to jump to different parts of the stage and exit stages. Checkpoint Birdbaths can set your starting point closer to the goal, or can be smashed open with your weapons in order to get a lot of health, a time bonus and other bonuses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHope you enjoy!",
