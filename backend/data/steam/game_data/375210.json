Water is life. They say it for a reason.<br>Find fresh water, refill water containers, collect rain water, or produce it from air humidity or salt water.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Body temperature</h2>High temperatures and dry air increase water loss, while low temperatures can cause sickness or even the body to shut down. Adapt or be left behind.<br>Shelter from cold or intense sun. Wear clothes to protect from rain, sun or to warm up.
