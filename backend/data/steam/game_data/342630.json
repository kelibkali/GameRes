    "description": "Once there was a wicked witch. And then one day she decided to get married, and not to someone, but to a handsome prince. <br />\r\nThe only problem - all the princes were engaged. All of them were picked up by beautiful princesses. Back then a cunning plan germinated in her dark soul - to destroy a family happiness of all beauties, and to turn the princes into frogs unless and until some of them come to senses and want to become betrothed of the evil witch.<br />\r\nShe lulled to eternal sleep one of the princesses along with her servants. That’s how the legend about Sleeping Beauty appeared.<br />\r\nThe young Snow White was poisoned by enchanted apple, and beauty’s body rests in the deep caves in the custody of seven gnomes.<br />\r\nWitch cut beautiful long hair of Princess Rapunzel and imprisoned her in an inaccessible cave among waterfalls. And a lovely Miss World was imprisoned in Witch’s basement. Just in order to teach others not to do so.<br />\r\nYou will have to set free the frog-princes from Witch’s captivity, to help them to get on to the beautiful brides to remove the witchcraft by kiss of love. <br />\r\nBut will you be able to discover all the secrets of Witch and restore the happy endings in fairy tales?",
