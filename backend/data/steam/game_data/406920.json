Green has a past to atone for, but he also must find his estranged daughter Anna. On his way through the ravaged planet, he will be faced with intense combat, encounter survivors, and feel the wind of adventure. Will this story have a happy ending?<br>...<br>Mutant Gate is written on its own ASCII engine, its 4-hour campaign featuring a multitude of scripted sequences within 2D, Doom-style levels. There's also an option for hybrid ASCII/tile visuals. The game auto-detects Steam Deck and supports its controls.</p>",
