    "description": "Cyberpunk 3099 is the story of Jake: A Syndicate arrested and sent to cryo jail for crimes on Space Station 4528.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJake awakes 300 years later with his empire lost to smaller factions within Sector 19 (sin city). Sector 19 is the Jail sector of the space station which is Run by Syn Corp, a large syndicate which was hired by the space station to keep order. Sector 19 is home to ex convicts and criminals who chose a life of crime or simply don't have the credits to leave the sector. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nJake's only option is to reclaim his empire, starting with Sector 19. If he can defeat the factions within the sector then he will gather enough credits for a space station citizen pass and earn his freedom. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou play as Jake with one goal. Reclaim your empire ! Take on the other syndicates to occupy the establishments once controlled by you 300 years ago. Earn protection credits from each block you reclaim. Bribe and fight your way to freedom. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nUse credits to expand your armoury. Purchase epic weapons to defeat the other syndicates. But be careful, challenging powerful syndicates without the proper defences, alliances and weapons will only get you killed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJake is a cyberpunk with a bio tech arm. Once you leave sector 19 the bio arm is activated. Beyond Sector 19 the entire space station is up for grabs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe year is 3099.
