The former will lead your character to uncover their forgotten memories and answer the question: what happened before arriving on the island? The latter quests will allow you to improve your relationships and unlock unique items that cannot otherwise be crafted. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1586340/extras/a7f1fa665726e7eb33fd45b278f97687.avif?t=1713806565\" width=680 height=144 /></span><br><br>What is life without a furry companion at your side?
