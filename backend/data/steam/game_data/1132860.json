First, the basic mechanics of walking and jumping are given to the player on the first area, the Village. There is where you will be able to talk with the different NPCs making use of a dialog system. There is also where the player is given the first power, the Earth, granting you the ability to swim in mud, being able to reach places you couldn’t otherwise. With this, the gameplay becomes more agile and dynamic, but not as much as when you are granted with the Fire power a bit later, a fire dash. <br><br>That is the moment in which the gameplay becomes the fastest and funniest. Then, the player gets the Water Power, and a bit of control and maneuverability is added to the gameplay, being it a gliding mist that makes you hover in the air. The game is fast, but more importantly, dynamic. The enemies and level design of the areas create interesting situations, and the art always stands as something pleasing to see while playing the game. There are some cinematics in the most important parts, and at the end, there is a final boss battle in which the player will need to use all its abilities and everything that has learnt, but this time, from a different perspective, creating a new and final challenge.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1132860/extras/a40fc13b180859695c853dd6bb194d1f.avif?t=1684843414\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Meet the villagers:</h2></strong><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1132860/extras/8bf5aa93149199c29b815ff94f5a7412.poster.avif?t=1684843414\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1132860/extras/8bf5aa93149199c29b815ff94f5a7412.webm?t=1684843414\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1132860/extras/8bf5aa93149199c29b815ff94f5a7412.mp4?t=1684843414\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Explore the forest:</h2></strong><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1132860/extras/3ee8e42fb97add9af0489c6f35c105c4.poster.avif?t=1684843414\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1132860/extras/3ee8e42fb97add9af0489c6f35c105c4.webm?t=1684843414\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1132860/extras/3ee8e42fb97add9af0489c6f35c105c4.mp4?t=1684843414\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Master your abilities:</h2></strong><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1132860/extras/b3513135a23c36a13ec0b8b41e79ca7a.poster.avif?t=1684843414\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1132860/extras/b3513135a23c36a13ec0b8b41e79ca7a.webm?t=1684843414\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1132860/extras/b3513135a23c36a13ec0b8b41e79ca7a.mp4?t=1684843414\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Avoid enemies:</h2></strong><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1132860/extras/a65f45dd0fd633b35c70f635910f5010.poster.avif?t=1684843414\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1132860/extras/a65f45dd0fd633b35c70f635910f5010.webm?t=1684843414\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1132860/extras/a65f45dd0fd633b35c70f635910f5010.mp4?t=1684843414\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Be the saviour:</h2></strong><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1132860/extras/72ab824141e5b3bd62f341e3026a68fd.poster.avif?t=1684843414\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1132860/extras/72ab824141e5b3bd62f341e3026a68fd.webm?t=1684843414\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1132860/extras/72ab824141e5b3bd62f341e3026a68fd.mp4?t=1684843414\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1132860/extras/a0314dc9cb71f37107ea1d9189626940.avif?t=1684843414\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1132860/extras/256ea00a9b83428fcb34c39a70f8971d.avif?t=1684843414\" width=600 height=176 /></span><br><br>The game was developed by 2nd Year students at DigiPen Institute of Technology Europe - Bilbao, in an 8-month project as part of their academic curriculum.
