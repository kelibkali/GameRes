    "description": "A game inspired by the jrpg of the nineties of turn battles, however it has something new like choices and freedom but like everything of the nineties do not think that you will find things easy.<br />\r\n interact and explore the game this is the biggest premise in this game of ten finals because even the main missions are not shown only commented by the npcs and the choices be careful what you choose after all.<br />\r\n you can end up as a slave or as the queen of your country this game is all interactable from buying a store to having an extra income to counting the truth to an old friend of your father will all give some kind of consequence whether it is good or bad I hope you like this experience different from other modern games",
