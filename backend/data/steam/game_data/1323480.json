    "description": "No One Can Ever Know is an autobiographical game about dealing with gender dysphoria, and the consequences of repressing your emotions. The game mechanics are inspired by classic survival horror games. As you navigate the levels, you encounter intrusive thoughts, which increase your dysphoria meter. If the meter reaches 100%, it's game over, so you need to properly manage your phone battery in order to distract yourself from the thoughts and make it through the day.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game's soundtrack is a collection of songs from various Patricia Taxxon albums.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContent warning: for: transphobia, death, and abuse<br />\r\n<br />\r\nControls<br />\r\n<br />\r\nW - Walk forward/enter room<br />\r\n<br />\r\nS - Walk backward<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA - Turn left<br />\r\n<br />\r\nD - Turn right<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnter - Accept/advance text<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpace - Open/close phone<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEsc - Enter/exit fullscreen",
