Their advanced technology and ruthless ways lead to a swift and certain death. Yet, as silent as they arrived, they disappeared back into the distant stars. You play as the lone survivor who, hidden aboard one of their spaceships, crashes into their planet with a score to settle. Nowhere to return and no one to save, revenge is all that remains…<br>There is only one thing on the Astronaut's mind: <strong>ASTROZOMBIES MUST BE DESTROYED</strong>!<br><br>With no fancy stuff like multiple jumps or power-ups (leave those to the <i>secret unlockable characters ;)</i> ), it’s up to your own prowess to get through the deadly stages and rid the universe of this evil.
