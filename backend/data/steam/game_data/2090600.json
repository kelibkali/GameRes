    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >ABOUT THE GAME</h2><br>Thistlemine is a puzzle exploration RPG. You play as Noa, a low-ranking excavator, whose task is to navigate and clear out an Exclusion Zone.<br><br>The Miasma emitting from the Exclusion Zone is causing distortions in time and space, while simultaneously suffocating and mutating what little life remains in the region. Rumours of a powerful artifact have attracted many souls to its location. Not one has returned.<br><br>Inside the Exclusion Zone awaits a massive garden labyrinth, the mutated remains of those who have come before, and the guardian Anomalis who've made the land their home.<br><br>Noa is outnumbered and ill-equipped for the task, and the conditions for survival are unfair. Armed with the ability to repeat short windows of time, only through patience, persistence, and planning will she find a glimpse of victory. <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2090600/extras/f4002d1105dfbe019eca10555ba4c6ba.avif?t=1732775714\" width=630 height=130 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >THE EXCLUSION ZONE</h2><br>Inside the Exclusion Zone is a number of disorienting and deceptive puzzles. There is a total of 7 major areas, each with many secrets to discover, and various combat encounters to overcome.<br><br>Depending on decisions made, resources used, or curiosity in solving areas in different ways, small variations may present themselves. These variations range from greater challenges, extra resources, additional story details, or knowledge of more efficient routes throughout the garden.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2090600/extras/3e6678aea1bd21e1361c2514b4c8702c.avif?t=1732775714\" width=630 height=130 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >THE EXCAVATORS</h2><br>As you navigate the Exclusion Zone, you will find members of the Excavation Corps. As they've spent too much time exposed to the Miasma, most of them are on the verge of death, or mutated beyond saving. However, some are still willing to help until their last breath.<br><br>Potential allies can be recruited into the party, or killed where they stand. The choice is yours.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2090600/extras/333dc980840ac06929f5f5774e36473b.avif?t=1732775714\" width=630 height=130 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >THE ANOMALIS</h2><br>Exclusion Zones are home to Miasma lifeforms known as Anomalis. They've taken the likeness of plants and flowers in this region.<br><br>During combat, Anomalis produce varying amounts of Miasma, limiting the amount of turns you have in any given battle. Combined with a diverse arsenal of lethal abilities and overwhelming numbers, defeating them is no easy task. There are over 40 unique encounters, many with multiple phases and subroute variations, all demanding a different strategy from the last.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2090600/extras/28d7b0fb9b75ae98a0bfb7e79e34f519.avif?t=1732775714\" width=630 height=130 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >THE ARTIFACTS</h2><br>Defeating enemies will sometimes reward Artifacts. Artifacts provide anything from powerful buffs, permanent stat bonuses, new skills, or an active ability.<br><br>The stronger Anomalis specifically reward unique artifacts necessary to conquer the Exclusion Zone. These are complex in both function and in application, providing new combat strategies, skill synergies, and attack strings. Figuring out how to use them in each battle can feel like a puzzle in itself, especially in combination with various turn limits and different enemy groups.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2090600/extras/f4002d1105dfbe019eca10555ba4c6ba.avif?t=1732775714\" width=630 height=130 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >ADDITIONAL MODES</h2><br>Thistlemine comes with 3 modes: Standard Mode, Regimental Mode, and the Temporal Rift.<br><br>Standard Mode is the normal gameplay experience. Checkpoints are plenty, dialogue and choices are enabled, there are minimal consequence for losing, and you can progress at your own pace.<br><br>Regimental Mode serves as a time attack variation to Thistlemine's gameplay, encouraging strategies and routes to save both turns and time, with a limit of 2 hours to clear the game. Some adjustments have been made to save as many frames as possible. Though completely optional, it is the canonical Thistlemine experience.<br><br>The Temporal Rift is equivalent to a dev room. It is unlocked by default. Players can use it to experiment with various mechanics and to further optimize their routes. This mode will feature additional challenges and cut content in future updates.",
