    "description": "The complete original soundtrack for Iron Reckoning, written and produced by Matt Enad, solo developer at RobProductions. Includes nearly two and a half hours of music content, with a special Bonus Track made specifically for this release! Mp3 files provided as well as optional high-quality FLAC formats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe score showcases a variety of moods and themes that are heard throughout Jaena's journey across the Aalegan Isles. Cutscene and trailer music tracks are also provided, which may include sections of songs that were previously unheard in the game itself. The soundtrack takes inspiration from other action game OSTs, featuring a mix of orchestral and electronic instrumentation, and chromatic shifts that amplify a sense of disturbance to fit the game's world.",
