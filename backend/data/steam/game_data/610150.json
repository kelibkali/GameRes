Its<br>a three-story building made of river stones and sturdy oak wood.

Strategically<br>placed halfway between two important cities, the Riverside Inn is the must-stop<br>of all the cargo ships sailing on the Great River. Many captains choose to make<br>a stop at the inn to drink its famous stout beer and taste its delicious sandwiches<br>stuffed with salted butter and salmon, even if many of these captains and crews<br>know about the hidden activity of the inn: a gambling house. Hidden behind secret<br>doors located in the huge inns cellar lie two gambling rooms where many of the<br>common hazards games are played all night long...<br>This product is an installable module for use with the Fantasy Ground II virtual<br>tabletop.
