He's totally reluctant to go to that damn place!<br><br>This exciting game features cartoon cinematics with over 3,000 hand-drawn animation frames.<br><br><br><u>From the notes of Detective Morris:</u><br> <br>« My new mission was to go to the haunted Ghost Palace to find a great big diamond. I had no desire to go to that wretched place at all! You might think I was scared, but that wasn't the case at all! Of course, my boss didn’t think anybody was up to the job except me! So I decided to take on this thrilling mission. Unfortunately for me, the task was much more insane than I had ever anticipated! Wandering ghosts and an annoying big rat kept catching me off my guard and attacking me! So finding diamonds was a big disaster, but I won’t spoil the surprise any further! You’ll just have to play the game and see what happened to me... »",
