    "description": "The Grid is a gigantic computer simulation with thousands of game worlds. It was originally designed for humans, but it was taken over by a faction of separatists AIs decades ago. For a long time it was closed and no one could access it. But now the Grid is opening again, and the AIs have allowed a limited number of players to explore it and participate to its games. The choice is yours: will you enter the Grid?",
