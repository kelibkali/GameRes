    "description": "Outgun is a multiplayer capture the flag game, with minimalist graphics in 2D top-view.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInspired by classic shooters from the 90s like Quake and Doom, Outgun was created as an open source game in 2002 by Brazilian Fabiana Cecin (Spinal) and developed between 2003 and 2011 by Finnish Niko Ritari (Nix) and Jani Rivinoja (Huntta).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers are divided into two teams, with the goal of stealing the enemy's flag and bringing it to their base while protecting their own flag. The team with the most captured flags wins the match. Its simplicity makes room for fast-paced action and competitive team play, making Outgun have a strong fan base even 18 years after its launch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game supports dedicated servers, bots, spectator mode and replays, as well as graphic and sound themes created by players.",
