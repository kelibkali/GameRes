    "description": "A Castles &amp; Crusades Library module for Fantasy Grounds<br>Castles &amp; Crusades Quick Start Rules (Free)<br>Throughout mankinds history, warfare has been an endemic part of his culture. From<br>tribal beginnings to the rise of the Roman Imperium and beyond, man has waged war.<br>The tools of this brutal trade have changed over the years, from simple stone to<br>complex metal. They have changed as necessity dictates and experience allows. These<br>are the arms and armor of the early medieval period of Western Europe.<br>This work will concentrate on the weapons and armor suits and pieces common to Western<br>Europe roughly covering 800 A.D. to 1200 A.D. This period saw the technology of<br>the warrior emerge from the traditions of the ancient Roman world and begin to develop<br>a uniquely European flavor, for a uniquely European warriors needs.<br>For the player of Castles &amp; Crusades (and many other RPGs) this work will give a<br>brief perspective on the history and effectiveness of certain arms and armor types.<br>All too often in RPGs, a weapon or armor type is given a weight and damage factor,<br>but not WHY the particular weapon or armor piece was created. What was the reason<br>for the Bearded Axe when the Roman Dolabra Axe was already invented? Why make a<br>Longsword when the Legionnaires Gladius Shortsword was already around? Why carry<br>a wooden shield when Iron ones were available? This work hopes to answer these questions<br>in a concise manner without bogging the reader down in a plethora of charts or dry<br>expositions!<br>This library module divides the various weapons and armor types into a brief listing<br>that gives the vital statistics of the item in question, followed by an annotated<br>description and history to allow Castle Keepers to place the armament in its proper<br>historical context.<br><strong>Requirements: </strong>The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the Castles<br>&amp; Crusades ruleset.<br><strong>Conversion by:</strong> Alan Neilson<br>The reproduction of material from within this product for the purposes of personal<br>or corporate profit, by file, photographic, optical, electronic, or other media<br>or methods of storage and retrieval, is prohibited.<br><strong>Requirements: </strong>The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the Castles<br>&amp; Crusades ruleset.<br><strong>Conversion by:</strong> Alan Neilson<br>The reproduction of material from within this product for the purposes of personal<br>or corporate profit, by file, photographic, optical, electronic, or other media<br>or methods of storage and retrieval, is prohibited.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Alan Neilson</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Castles &amp; Crusades ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
