Every NPC has an emotional, heart-moving, sometimes shocking story behind them.  We try to add stories that are not just fantasy but stories that can happen in the world we are living in.  They are blended into quests / setting / music and art.  We want to give you a special experience through stories. <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/771580/extras/4c36eada9b44423be8213a31eba4a8c4.poster.avif?t=1724967175\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/771580/extras/4c36eada9b44423be8213a31eba4a8c4.webm?t=1724967175\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/771580/extras/4c36eada9b44423be8213a31eba4a8c4.mp4?t=1724967175\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>ART</strong></h2>Mad World has an isometric hand-drawn style.  We want a kind of a look that leaves a long-lasting impression on you so that when you see our game next time, you can immediately recognize that it's Mad World.  Our inspirations don't just come from games.  We try to take reference from non-game elements like contemporary art, books, real-life people and more. <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/771580/extras/7f689b75a18c17a77e5706c72da4f698.poster.avif?t=1724967175\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/771580/extras/7f689b75a18c17a77e5706c72da4f698.webm?t=1724967175\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/771580/extras/7f689b75a18c17a77e5706c72da4f698.mp4?t=1724967175\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>MONSTERS</strong></h2>We do our best to create unique, twisted, weird and cool looking monsters, especially Bosses.  We are partly inspired by Cthulhu Mythos among many others.  Some of our keywords are weird, grotesque and full of fear and madness. <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/771580/extras/77f3dcc525f11171b27041db00557e51.poster.avif?t=1724967175\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/771580/extras/77f3dcc525f11171b27041db00557e51.webm?t=1724967175\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/771580/extras/77f3dcc525f11171b27041db00557e51.mp4?t=1724967175\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>ACTION</strong></h2>Mad World’s combat is based on a Moving Shot mechanic.  We spend lots of time making sure skills are fun to perform and the tempo is addictive.  Skills are more focused on 1 vs. many than on 1 vs. 1.  There are no classes in Mad World, skills are based upon the weapons you equip.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/771580/extras/66bd8932480f2b99be437b96566184cb.poster.avif?t=1724967175\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/771580/extras/66bd8932480f2b99be437b96566184cb.webm?t=1724967175\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/771580/extras/66bd8932480f2b99be437b96566184cb.mp4?t=1724967175\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>PLAY TOGETHER</strong></h2>Solo play is possible but that's not the direction we are going. We want an MMORPG that's more fun if you play together.  That’s why we try to add as much community content as possible.  PVE and PVP are an important part of the game. <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/771580/extras/c07922a53b54d9a329845a341d8dad0a.poster.avif?t=1724967175\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/771580/extras/c07922a53b54d9a329845a341d8dad0a.webm?t=1724967175\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/771580/extras/c07922a53b54d9a329845a341d8dad0a.mp4?t=1724967175\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
