    "description": "Have you ever had a feeling where you are walking down a narrow hallway and you feel like there's something behind you but you can't turn around because if you do, then something bad will happen? If you turn around, its over so your only chance of winning is by not turning around. Just make it to the end and you won. It shouldn't be hard.<br><br>This is a simple first-person horror game where you are placed in a narrow hallway. You only have a flashlight to help you see whats in front of you. You can only go forward and there is no turning back. Your goal is to make it to the end of the hallway without looking back. So<br><br><strong>DON&quot;T LOOK BACK</strong>",
