The candid and straightforward nature of the game is part of the reason I decided to reach out to you.<br><br>The people who play the game really connect with it, and I want to have more people take a look and hopefully get the same impact from the game that the game and the community around it had on us. <br><br>If you have any questions about the game, we have Steam Discussion page.<br><br><br><strong>FEATURES</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>300,000 word+ Story<br></li><li>A true open world with free travel, leading to a different play through every time.<br></li><li>Seven complete character arcs with over 20 endings<br></li><li>Complete soundtrack with over 30 unique compositions<br></li><li>Over 100 unique illustrations.</li></ul>",
