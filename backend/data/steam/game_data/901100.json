    "description": "Assassin's Creed™ is the next-gen game developed by Ubisoft Montreal that redefines the action genre. While other games claim to be next-gen with impressive graphics and physics, Assassin's Creed merges technology, game design, theme and emotions into a world where you instigate chaos and become a vulnerable, yet powerful, agent of change.<br>\t\t\t\t\tThe setting is 1191 AD. The Third Crusade is tearing the Holy Land apart. You, Altair, intend to stop the hostilities by suppressing both sides of the conflict.<br>\t\t\t\t\tYou are an Assassin, a warrior shrouded in secrecy and feared for your ruthlessness. Your actions can throw your immediate environment into chaos, and your existence will shape events during this pivotal moment in history.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Be an Assassin</strong> - Master the skills, tactics and weapons of history's deadliest and most secretive clan of warriors. Plan your attacks, strike without mercy and fight your way to escape.<br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Experience exclusive PC content</strong> - Four PC-exclusive investigation missions make the game an even better experience than its console predecessors, including the Rooftop Race Challenge, a race to a specified location and the Archer Stealth Assassination Challenge, where the player must assassinate all archers in a certain zone to help out fellow Assassins.<br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Realistic and responsive environments</strong> - Experience a living, breathing world in which all your actions have consequences.
