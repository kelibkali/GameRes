    "description": "Play as a young child waking up in the middle of a deep forest at dusk, confused but not completely alone. In classic side-scrolling adventure fashion, you will need to explore and navigate your way back home before you freeze to death in the pouring rain. Or is there more to discover? <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Decisions, Decisions</strong> - Help the creepy inhabitants of the forest in order to get help in return, or you could hinder them...<br></li><li><strong>Manage Inventory</strong> - Find all the items you can, any of them may be of use, but try not to carry too much.<br></li><li><strong>New Experiences</strong> - Navigate through a different procedurally-generated world on each playthrough.<br></li><li><strong>Multiple endings</strong> - See if you can find them all. There isn’t only one path back home, or maybe, home isn’t exactly what you believe it to be?</li></ul>",
