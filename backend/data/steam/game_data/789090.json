    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >ATTENTION: THIS GAME REQUIRES HIGH-SPEED CONTROLLER TRACKING</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Unfortunately, Steam removed some VR compatibility indicators, so we have to put it plainly here: Rainbow Reactor uses extremely accurate physics that only work with high-speed controller tracking. This means that throwing accuracy can suffer greatly from using wireless solutions like Air Play, Virtual Desktop etc - depending on your setup. Also, the game does not support lower frequency positional tracking like what is used in WMR for example. In short, it is advised to play this game using external tracking like lighthouses. On a side note, this makes this game an ideal tool to find out how good the inside-out tracking of HMDs and also the speed and reliablity of your wireless transmission is.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >// end of Public Service Announcement //</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Welcome to the future! </strong>In this fun-packed VR game which is easy to understand but hard to master, you'll help to provide an entire city with the future's very own and very clean Rainbow Energy - at the RAINBOW REACTOR!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Normal operations have collapsed when the loading crane malfunctioned.
