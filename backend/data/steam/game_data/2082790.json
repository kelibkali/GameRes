A simple Missing Person case, I thought. I’ve solved a hundred of them. Why should this one be any different? If only I had known how wrong I was, known how high the stakes were and how the fate of every man, woman and child would rest on my actions.  <br><br>Sure, I thought I had seen it all in my time–betrayals and revelations, signs and wonders!.  When you have been doing this as long as I have, you learn to roll with the punches, expect the unexpected. At my age, I didn’t think it was possible to surprise me anymore.  Nothing new under the sun and all that. <br><br>I could have walked away. When I started to suspect who was involved and what it would mean, I could have bowed out. Saving the world is a young man’s game and I’ve already paid my dues.  The “30 Years Meritorious Service” medal I have in my sock drawer says so. I should just let this one go.  <br><br>But the truths and lies I have uncovered in the last few days have opened my eyes to something sinister.  Something evil lurking just below the surface in this town I love, this town I thought I knew. <br>This town called Happenstance. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2082790/extras/6ae84624d0d927f1401971ccea90d78a.avif?t=1663672100\" width=620 height=110 /></span><br><br>A Town Called Happenstance is a (fairly) traditional point and click adventure, in a stunning cel-shaded style and built in Unreal Engine.
