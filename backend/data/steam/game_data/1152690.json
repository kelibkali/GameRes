The <strong>Prologue Chapter</strong> is a standalone experience and progress will not carry over to future chapters in the series, however it will give you an idea as to what future chapters can be. Which is why we have decided to release this chapter for free. We want to start to build a community around this game so feel free to join the game’s discord to provide us with useful feedback(Linked in the sidebar). The <strong>Prologue Chapter</strong> is a great introduction into the world and lore we are building and you will be able to become acquainted with some characters who will be present in <strong> The Between </strong>. <br><br>    We look forward to working with the community as we move forward with development of <strong>Chapter One</strong>.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1152690/extras/f8e81b7ffcc94a72d325f6e6c480a100.avif?t=1652130821\" width=600 height=150 /></span><br>    At its core, &quot;<strong>The Inn Between</strong>&quot; is a uniquely styled role-playing game with turn-based combat and rich storytelling.
