    "description": "Shadow of the Mask is a classically inspired Point’n’Click graphic adventure in which detective Alanis investigates a brutal murder that will shake her trust in some of the greatest names from the Golden Age of Superheroes.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis retro-futuristic adventure full of mystery explores a dystopian world full of aliens, robots, superheroes fallen from grace, big corporations and conspiracies. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis project was born out of the love for graphic adventure of a group of people led by production team Tetera y Kiwi. With no initial funding to speak of, we have dedicated a full year of our lives to developing this videogame, meeting online to discuss a world that we have built away from each other, but together. <br />\r\nIn Shadow of the Mask we are use quite the colorful visuals to tell a very dark tale. We are currently backed by game distributor Steam’s Green Light program, but we seek further funding to fully develop the game. Emerald City’s Department of Superheroic Crime has many mysteries to offer, and with your patronage we’ll have the means to have you explore them with us.",
