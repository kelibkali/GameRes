    "description": "On a beautiful day, a young man awakens in a forest, deep in the Hinodean wilds. He doesn't remember how he got there, what he was doing, or where he needs to be. Despite this, wielding a blade is all too familiar to him, and his knowledge of ancient history is greater than scholars that have studied their entire lives. On a quest to remember his past, the young man sets out, eager to find his way...<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Customize your heroes the way you want. Should Aedric focus on taunting his foes, empowering his blade with flame, or sundering his enemy's armour, reducing its effectiveness for the rest of battle? Each character has 24 skills to choose from, and the Power Point system allows you to pick a new skill every time the heroes level up.<br><br></li><li> The world is full of dangerous enemies, and each requires their own strategy. The Aranea Queen, for example, is a dangerous foe that can trap someone in webs, and devour them instantly if they aren't freed in time!<br><br></li><li> There are a number of status effects, bonuses, and penalties that will hinder or help you during the journey. If you are unsure what a status effect does, mouseover the character or monster, and all of their statuses will display descriptions. Additionally, use the Combat Log to check previous battles, or catch up on something you might've missed in the midst of the fight.<br><br></li><li> Battles are turn-based, with unique mechanics. Powerful spells will take time to cast, and characters can use Free Actions, special skills that allow them to instantly act again. Some fights will grant the heroes temporary abilities, like the Assist command, which lets someone provide aid to their friends.<br><br></li><li> Enemy aggro is based on a threat system. Characters that deal the most damage will have the enemy's attention. To help tweak aggro management in your favour, a variety of options are available, like the Ring of Pacifism, or the skill, Defensive Casting.<br><br></li><li> There are a number of items to buy and outfit your heroes with. Will you buy stronger gloves for Rhea, or a holy symbol for Athena? Some items teach additional skills, making them even more valuable. While gold crowns are plentiful, they are finite, so spend them wisely!<br><br></li><li> Items have a number of different qualities and differences. Blades forged in Hinode, for example, increase their wielders' critical hit chance, while those made in Guinevere are far more accurate, making it much easier to hit enemies with high evasion.<br><br></li><li> The story is emotional and relatable, focusing on a group of friends that face hardships together, and how they change over time. Trials of Kokoro explores themes of family, facing one's past, and the concept of trust.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Characters</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2053150/extras/Aedric.png?t=1684166630\" /></span><br><br><strong>Aedric </strong><br><br>Aedric awakens in a mysterious meadow, deep in the forests of Hinode. He doesn't remember anything before then, and is on a mission to remember who he is, and where he belongs. Aedric is incredibly naive about many things, and can be far too trusting of those he doesn't know.<br><br>In battle, Aedric wears heavy armour and wields swords. Aedric can choose to carry a shield, which allows him to completely block incoming physical attacks, or he can forgo defense for greater attacking strength, choosing to fight with two-handed swords, instead. Aedric's powers allow him to add a variety of elemental effects to his strikes, and he has a number of spell-like abilities, as well.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2053150/extras/Rhea.png?t=1684166630\" /></span><br><br><strong>Rhea</strong><br><br>A young Sol-Ikati, Rhea meets Aedric while foraging for herbs, and immediately develops a friendship with him.

Rhea can encourage her allies, protecting them from fear and boosting their attack, or increase her own speed and evasion, allowing her to act twice as fast as her friends.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2053150/extras/Athena.png?t=1684166630\" /></span><br><br><strong>Athena</strong><br><br>Athena is a traveling healer from the Guineverian city of Berholven, A Favoured of Trestae, Goddess of the Stars, she seeks to atone for her mistakes.
