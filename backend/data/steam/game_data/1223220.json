    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Welcome to Ragamuffins!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Nestled in the sleepy village of Felinsha, just between the candle-maker and the man who shouts at bread, sits a little shop called Ragamuffins.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >It’s run by Mr Tibbs, a well-dressed tom with too much confidence and not enough scruples. The sort of cat who’ll sell you a “rare imported spoon” while quietly wondering if it’s still warm from someone else’s kitchen.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >By day, he’s the picture of respectability — sweeping the floor, weighing fish, and telling anyone who’ll listen that he’s definitely retired from that sort of thing. By night, he sends his tiny gang of kittens out into the cobbled streets, armed with claws, cunning, and a few suspiciously shiny playing cards.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Because in Felinsha, cards aren’t just for games — they’re for getting away with things.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Each job, each deal, each scuffle in a moonlit alley plays out like a hand of fate. You’ll draw your cards, play your tricks, and hope Lady Luck hasn’t already spent the evening with the constable.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Of course, Tibbs insists he’s an honest businessman now. He says he only cheats when absolutely necessary — which, in Felinsha, is most of the time.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >But the past has long claws. And every deal, every theft, every flick of a card seems to draw something darker a little closer…</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >✨ Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >🛒 Run the Shop</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Buy, sell, and barter with Felinsha’s finest — the butcher, the baker, the chronic liar. Keep your shelves stocked, your kittens fed, and your stories just believable enough that no one calls the guard.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >🌙 Steal by Moonlight</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >When the shutters close, the real work begins. Send your kittens to collect goods from the good people of Felinsha. Avoid guards, rival gangs, and nosey neighbours with more curiosity than sense.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >♠️ Play Your Cards Right</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Every heist and hustle runs on your hand. Build and play your deck of actions, tricks, and evasions — a few slaps, a dash of stealth, a sprinkle of pure nonsense — and hope the draw’s in your favour.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >⚔️ Risk, Reward, Regret</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You’ve only got so much room in those little paws — take too much loot and you’ll have no space left for anything else. Take too few weapons and, well… let’s just say someone will be doing the looting for you. Every decision’s a gamble — and Tibbs has never met a gamble he didn’t like.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >🐾 A World of Whiskers and Whispers</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Felinsha looks charming from the outside — the market’s lively, the fish are fresh, and the crime rate is mostly adorable. But dig deeper and you’ll find corruption, old enemies, and maybe a few ghosts from Tibbs’ less-than-honest youth.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >🎩 Charming. Cunning. Catastrophic.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Play as Mr Tibbs — merchant, rogue, card-sharp, and self-proclaimed “pillar of the community.”</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Keep the shop running, play your cards right, and try to stay one paw ahead of your past.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Because in Felinsha, everyone’s bluffing — and the house always wins. 🐾 </p>",
