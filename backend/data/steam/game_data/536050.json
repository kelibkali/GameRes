We will be continually adding content including new games, areas to explore, and objects to find.  Our current plan is to alternate bi weekly between game play additions and &quot;this should make things not break so often&quot; additions.  As this is Early Access we are positive there will be things to fix and tighten as we march towards final release like Frodo to Mordor.  We are excited about community comments regarding the game and additions y'all would like to see.  Do you's guys want custom avatars?  Would you pay for them?  Maybe best community suggestion gets a free avatar of their choice?  As stated earlier, we aren't focused on AAA presentation because we would rather play a sloppy ball of fun than a highly polished easily palatable turd.  Not that there is anything wrong with Assassin's Creed, we even liked Unity!  So you can buy now at a cheap rate and come along for the ride or you can sit back, buy it later, and said you owned it all along...hipster. ;)</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>",
