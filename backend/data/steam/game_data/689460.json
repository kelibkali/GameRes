    "description": "Take control of three heroes and fight your way through the Dungeon! Trinity Dungeon is a game of tactics and positioning in a procedurally generated dungeon, where each new game is fresh and interesting. Each level provides its own unique set of challenges and monsters, and yields different loot every time. Every fourth level contains a powerful boss who is a tough obstacle to any party. The fourth boss bears the Amulet, and defeating it wins the game and restores light to the world!",
