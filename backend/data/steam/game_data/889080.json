    "description": "Deity Empires is a 4X, turn-based strategy game with a powerful “just one more turn” feel! Enter an intricate fantasy world as one of many deities posed to become ruler of the world. On a backdrop of classic 2D graphics, choose from one of the many playable races, and compete with rival deities as you explore the world. Extract food, natural resources, and valuable minerals from the land, and increase your power as you defeat wild monster lairs and build cities to expand your empire. Defeat rival deity armies in tactical battles, increasing the skill of your units with every victory. Materialize your deity to become a unit with extraordinary powers to lead an army in battle. Or strategically transcend your deity into an etherealized form, casting magical spells throughout the world and in any battle, and growing in power as you research magical spells and increase your magic skills in your quest for world domination. <br><br><strong>HUGE VARIABILITY IN GAME PLAY:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Choose your deity's starting abilities from over 30 deity abilities, and select your starting magic knowledge from 10 different schools of magic.
