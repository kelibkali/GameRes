A newly entrapped resident of the Labyrinth, you must destroy the fortress using the guidance of the long term captives. <br><br>Players will be tasked with a series of strategic encounters against a robotic army which will challenge their ability to think quickly. Using Anaesse’s abilities, you must fight your way out of a necromancer’s sky fortress. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/773910/extras/efc80ea70366b65406319a3d3c500301.poster.avif?t=1521358989\" width=600 height=124 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/773910/extras/efc80ea70366b65406319a3d3c500301.webm?t=1521358989\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/773910/extras/efc80ea70366b65406319a3d3c500301.mp4?t=1521358989\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>The Short Story is an isometric action game which gives you a choice between strategic, hack-n-slash, or mixed style gameplay.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A Fascinating New World</h2>The Short Story takes place in a floating Labyrinth, created by an ancient necromancer and inhabited by strange robotic beasts.
