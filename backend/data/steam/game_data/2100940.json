    "description": "Redhot Rabbit is a hand drawn, monochrome, 2D platformer with a rich visual style rooted in the silent movie era.<br>WASD, spacebar, and Enter keys control running, jumping, attacking from above, and throwing exploding projectiles. Time is a factor so for the highest possible score make your run a fast one. If you don't die much, a run might take about an hour and produce a decent score if it was a good one. Speed running the game will produce a decent score too due to the time bonus. The <i>highest </i>scores can only be achieved through the player's choice of a balance between the two. You'll have to choose what to speed run past and what to play through for points/health. You'll need health. Some bosses you might get past without a drawn out fight. Some you'll have no choice but to fully engage.<br>Soundtrack features some of the greatest foxtrot and dancehall jazz hits of the late teens and early 1920s. Composers and ensembles include Irving Berlin and the Original Dixieland Jazz Band.<br><br>DEV'S NOTE 9/24/22: We have one report that the game wouldn't play on the Steam Deck. We also have one report that it DOES play well on your Steam Deck. TreeofEmber says, &quot;It runs and looks excellent on the Steam Deck. The controls need to be configured to work. I went with: A as jump, B as slam on the ground, R2 as shoot carrots, and right analog stick as left / right.&quot;",
