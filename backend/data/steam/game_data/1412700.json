    "description": "The demo contains the first half an hour of the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat happens to the inhabitants of a game world after you have finished it?<br />\r\nIn No one lives in heaven the NPCs have been left alone for years and you are the first person to meet them again. All your decisions have consequences and influence the course of history. Will you manage to change the fate of the NPCs for the better or will you become a prisoner of the game yourself? Is your humanity strong enough to stand your ground?<br />\r\nNo one lives in heaven does not give you a role to play. You are not a chosen hero, who defeats an evil force with the help of his grinded abilities. The role you play is you, and the fate you decide upon is your own.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n40 hour campaign with high replay value<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver 100 different endings and an almost infinite number of possible game passages, depending on the decisions being made.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver 200 unique NPCs with over 300 individually designed quests and a variety of side activities for hundreds of hours of fun<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach player will receive a free copy of the book Encyclopaedia Comédica: A serious journey to funny realms<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe most comprehensive RPG-Maker game ever",
