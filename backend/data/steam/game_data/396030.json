    "description": "InCell is an action/racing game with a bit of strategy and science thrown into the mix in a rare and highly unusual microworld of the carefully recreated human cell. This is the right project to start your acquaintance with VR or receive new VR impressions. The game is focused on Virtual Reality but you can play just fine without a set.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Ready steady go!</h2>Thanks to all robot-gods out there we will not take this journey alone -  our humble (with a tiny control-everyone mania) assistant is waiting for us (she is so sweet, isn’t she?). <strong>The Most Excellent Assistant Zero-Seven</strong> (she said that humans may refer to her simply as ‘Your Highness’). So the player’s task is to impress TMEAR07 with experiment on volunteer to unlock new healing technology for humanity. The problem is she doesn’t believe in that possibility because humans are simple and illogical (and she is genius… as always).<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/396030/extras/61176859af730d13f61179c7974238f3.avif?t=1725275830\" width=616 height=308 /></span><br><br>To cure our volunteer Mrs. Jane Smith and impress TMEAR07  players must select the right way through the objects (organelles) to the cell’s nucleus and do their best in innovative radial racings between selected objects.
