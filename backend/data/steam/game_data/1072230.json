    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Masters and Minions</h2>One thing we've noticed as game masters ourselves, is the challenge that most GMs face: prep time. With busy lives like ours in mind, we wanted to create a book that has NEW content to help with that! The idea with Masters and Minions was to develop some Bosses and their followers, but with a focus on how they use their minions - and provide some tips and strategies that any GM can &quot;drag and drop&quot; into a new or existing game. This new content will span levels 1 - 20, so the book will continue to provide you with new content as your players level up!<br>Masters and Minions Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>16 bosses and their minions<br></li><li>6 new monsters<br></li><li>tips and strategies<br></li><li>developed antagonists<br></li><li>motivations, goals and strategies for masters<br></li><li>plot ideas and roleplaying hooks<br></li><li>new lore<br></li><li>&quot;plug and play&quot; options for new or existing campaigns<br></li><li>the benefit of time-saving while prepping for a game<br></li><li>**All new** content not previously published or compiled from other products.<br></li><li>Detailed NPCs, with the primary focus being how the masters implement and use their minions.<br></li><li>Minions will be unique (new monsters). Alternate minion types will also be suggested.<br></li><li>Lore and description on each Master and how they use their minions.<br></li><li>Each Master has story hooks, tricks, and strategy on how to use each one effectively. This can potentially save hours of prep time for a GM.</li></ul><strong>Creative Team:</strong><br><strong><br>Dan Dillon</strong><br><i>, writer:</i>Tome of Beasts/Kobold Press, Adventurer's League, Rogue Genius Games, Legendary Games, Rite Publishing.<br><strong><br>Jim Pinto</strong>,<br><i>writer</i>: Legend of the Five Rings, Warlord, Protocol Praxis, The Carcass, George's Children, World's Largest Dungeon<br><strong><br><i>Foreword by</i><br>Matthew Colville</strong>: Writer and designer in video games.
