    "description": "Offscreen Colonies was originally a non-interactive demonstration of graphical, musical and programming prowess. This VR version transports you right in the middle of the futuristic landscapes to be able to enjoy the experience from a whole new perspective.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile this artwork was built using advanced procedural content creation techniques, it was driven purely by the desire to create something visually and aurally extraordinary. As it was produced as a spare-time project, the VR edition - like the original - remains free to enjoy for all.",
