    "description": "<strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >THE FIRST PASSENGER</h2></strong><br><br>The Fall of Lazarus: The First Passenger is the conclusive prologue and demo of The Fall of Lazarus. In this little adventure set in the year 2180 you will play as Caleb Rogers, a Gen-Ethics (an audit firm focused on controlling the normative and quality of criogenic, clonation and genetic alteration processes) who wakes up in the USSC Lazarus against his will.<br> <br>The First Passenger is a little slice of the final game where we showcase all the playable mechanics of the full game and also works as an example of the narrative we want to play with. You can play a whole level of the USSC Lazarus out of the five levels will include the final game, every one of them highly detailed and full of objects and terminals to interact with while playing the main story. But we wanted you to enjoy this little stand alone experience separately if you want to. This is only the prologue with another protagonist but we highly recommend you to stay tuned and, when the day comes, enjoy the full experience.",
