    "description": "This game was made by high schoolers as a passion project. We made a platformer game where you are a knight with a small sword that parkours through the map, defeats enemies, and slays bosses. The game is easy to understand, you move, jump, and attack. However, the game can get pretty difficult at times, to make up for its simplistic nature and short duration. I hope you enjoy the game and have a wonderful time. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n:)",
