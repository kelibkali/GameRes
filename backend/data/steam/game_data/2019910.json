    "description": "The &quot;riches&quot; set. Introduces Colony and Platinum, a step up from Province and Gold, which make for longer games. Has lots of special Treasures, and introduces VP tokens, which let you get points without getting Victory cards. Also has four cards that cost $7. Low on Attacks.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2019910/extras/a756cf838a018fd827f61a16bca5ba9c.avif?t=1706777236\" width=600 height=224 /></span><br>Prosperity introduces Treasures with abilities.

Normally, the game ends if Provinces are empty or any three piles are empty. In Prosperity, the game also ends if Colonies are empty.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Flavor</h2><br><i>Ah, money. There’s nothing like the sound of coins clinking in your hands. You vastly prefer it to the sound of coins clinking in someone else’s hands, or the sound of coins just sitting there in a pile that no-one can quite reach without getting up. Getting up, that’s all behind you now. Life has been good to you. Just ten years ago, you were tilling your own fields in a simple straw hat. Today, your kingdom stretches from sea to sea, and your straw hat is the largest the world has ever known. You also have the world’s smallest dog, and a life-size statue of yourself made out of baklava. Sure, money can’t buy happiness, but it can buy envy, anger, and also this kind of blank feeling. You still have problems – troublesome neighbors that must be conquered. But this time, you’ll conquer them in style.</i><br>-- Donald X.
