In this point-and-click, you play Fia Quinn, a time agent for the ChronoZen agency. Your job is to keep close watch on seven travelers who have the desire (and the bank accounts) to sightsee in the past. Some are simply curious. Others have unfinished business to resolve. And they’ve all put down a lot of money for the trip, so it’s vital that you keep them happy while ensuring they follow the rules. But what could go wrong? It's only time travel, after all.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1346360/extras/862941386c6fbed28d65589bbebaf91f.poster.avif?t=1745531076\" width=612 height=280 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1346360/extras/862941386c6fbed28d65589bbebaf91f.webm?t=1745531076\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1346360/extras/862941386c6fbed28d65589bbebaf91f.mp4?t=1745531076\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Features:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Seven eras of history to visit!
