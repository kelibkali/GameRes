Choose simple and safe cases or take risks for a bigger reward.<br><br></li><li><strong>Decide for yourself what your agency will be</strong><br>While your detectives are gaining experience on missions, you can improve your agency. Build a break room to give your detectives a place to relax. Build the wiretap room to receive irrefutable evidence or the laboratory to analyze collected clues.<br><br></li><li><strong>Participate in the investigation</strong><br>Solve cases by guessing and collecting clues! The prosperity of your agency depends on your choice. But the success of the case will depend not only on your deductive abilities but also on the amount of evidence that your detectives collect!<br><br></li><li><strong>Take care of your detectives</strong><br>Keep track of the needs of your agents.
