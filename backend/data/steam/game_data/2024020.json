    "description": "You, a 48 year old journalist Abraham Torres move to the infamous Freedom Towers to clear up the mysteries and horrors which have been haunting the resident for years and years. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou investigate the apartments and rooms, find out the secrets of other residents and at the end you hope to write a book about all the secrets of Freedom Towers. Or maybe everything will turn out differently than you think. Get to know to your fears and your feelings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSometimes They Come Back is a game in which you will experience a deep swamp full of sorrow, pain, and agony — but also joy, compassion, and pride. Solve the puzzles, find out secrets, cry and suffer with the stories you discover. STCB is not your typical horror game, it is a game you will talk and dream about.",
