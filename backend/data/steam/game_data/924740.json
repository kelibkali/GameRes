Our world is complex and unexplored. We mostly don't notice anything of all this thanks to secret organizations whose objective is the <strong>elimination of paranormal phenomena</strong>.<br><br>In Beyond Senses, you'll slip into the role of either a good hunter or an evil demon. Discover the world Beyond our Senses! Countless features guarantee a <strong>varied</strong> and <strong>unforgettable gaming experience</strong>. Beyond Senses can be played by up to 5 players!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/924740/extras/3c46458cba090024307558a10e55b5eb.poster.avif?t=1667067595\" width=630 height=114 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/924740/extras/3c46458cba090024307558a10e55b5eb.webm?t=1667067595\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/924740/extras/3c46458cba090024307558a10e55b5eb.mp4?t=1667067595\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Beyond Senses is one of those rare multiplayer horror games that offer more than just one game mode! Three game modes are currently available: <strong>HUNT</strong>, <strong>EGOIST</strong> and <strong>BANISHMENT</strong>. Each game mode can be customized to your personal needs.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>In <strong>HUNT</strong>, your task is to weaken the wandering creature by charging blessed <strong>Energy Crystals</strong> and killing it afterwards. The more energy the Crystals receive, the weaker the creature becomes after some time. If the creature is weakened enough, you can <strong>kill it</strong> with your weapons and send it back to hell!<br></li><li>In <strong>EGOIST</strong> you compete against your fellow players. Your goal is to conquer as many Energy Crystals as possible. Whoever has conquered the fewest Energy Crystals after a certain time will be <strong>hunted mercilessly</strong> by the wandering creature. You can use a <strong>stun gun</strong> to put your fellow players out of action for a short time and gain a time advantage.<br></li><li>In <strong>BANISHMENT</strong> you must find all the <strong>cursed items</strong> and place them properly in a <strong>pentagram</strong>. Once you have successfully completed the ritual, you must <strong>lure</strong> the wandering creature into the pentagram to send it back to hell!</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/924740/extras/854b251c30f92104b0baeb1bca584495.poster.avif?t=1667067595\" width=630 height=114 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/924740/extras/854b251c30f92104b0baeb1bca584495.webm?t=1667067595\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/924740/extras/854b251c30f92104b0baeb1bca584495.mp4?t=1667067595\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Evil is all around us.
