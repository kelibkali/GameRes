    "description": "OUBEY dedicated this multilayered painting from 1985 to the Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa and his epic masterpiece “The Seven Samurai”. Set in the year 1587, the film is a masterly tale of the demise of the samurai way of life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this VR you’re in a tight space surrounded by the deep red of the painting. By wielding the virtual sword you can open up its deeper layers and discover “the picture behind the picture” whilst also leaving your own tracks in the painting.assen.",
