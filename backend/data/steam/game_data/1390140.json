Everything is going just as it should and everyone is doing their part - except that hasn’t stopped the frost from growing through the farmbeds and the lights from crackle-popping in the frigid night. Every once in a while, spectral glimpses of the cities of old can be admired through the permafrost asbut the elders only mutter ”the past is the past’. The Silver Storm is now nothing but a story told to keep cadets under their electric blankets at night. <br><br>With fantasies of canned ham and the magical foods of The Before time drifting through the new cadet’s mind, a glimpse of a factory lost deep in the ice beneath her makeshift bed is all she needs to make her decision - she’s going down. As she drills, a crack forms, a large crack that swallows her up and slides her into the depths of the ice below. <br><br>Lost in the Underice, she must now find her family the food they need while navigating the dangers lurking below her world. If that means she has to solve the mystery of The Silver Storm and end the global ice age, then so be it. People have to eat.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1390140/extras/039eaa7eace59c6a35a7345366c897fb.avif?t=1716473637\" width=600 height=334 /></span><br><br>NIA is a lighthearted old-school 2D platformer with a few modern twists. <br><br><br>13 worlds hand crafted to offer the best possible experience.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1390140/extras/d55d73e1d38e5e4519a65561ca0dd565.poster.avif?t=1716473637\" width=512 height=256 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1390140/extras/d55d73e1d38e5e4519a65561ca0dd565.webm?t=1716473637\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br>A complex simplicity reminiscent of the classics, handcrafted levels for fans of platformers old and new.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1390140/extras/36a278f9015f5f16803d40957ffcbef2.avif?t=1716473637\" width=512 height=288 /></span><br><br><strong>Features</strong>: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Drill, smash, leap and slide through pixel retro graphics &amp; icepunk aesthetics <br></li><li>Play as Esmeralda Fallowfield, an icepunk prospector from a frozen future<br></li><li>Dozens of uniquely themed worlds<br></li><li>Well over a 100 different levels &amp; puzzles<br></li><li>Side Scrolling platformer puzzle goodness</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1390140/extras/19cba17b3136f1c52298a7cd7988f153.poster.avif?t=1716473637\" width=512 height=512 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1390140/extras/19cba17b3136f1c52298a7cd7988f153.webm?t=1716473637\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1390140/extras/40d23cc78b59b7606b4e2fcd1a9d6c6b.avif?t=1716473637\" width=606 height=633 /></span>",
