Your end goal? The president of the world.<br><br>Take over the minds of different users and force them into relationships.<br>The more people date, the more popular the site gets. Keep the momentum going and before long you’ll hook the president! A plan so simple that nothing could possibly go wrong.<br><br>Introducing a fresh take on bullet-hell gameplay!<br>Anti-viruses want you dead, your date wants you to answer their messages, and to top it off everything’s a platformer because why not. The people you control each come with a unique mechanic. Double jump, hover, piercing shots, the list goes on. Half the skills are yours to keep, but the other half are left behind. Choose your favorites as the game progresses and build the playstyle that’s right for you.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1228430/extras/a40fc13b180859695c853dd6bb194d1f.avif?t=1670244823\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>full voice acting<br></li><li>a stylish interface<br></li><li>a somehow fluid mix of bullet-hell, dating-sim, and platforming mechanics<br></li><li>a unique progression system that alters your character based on which couples you form<br></li><li>nine or twelve characters (depends on what you define as a person)<br></li><li>a quiz on tapeworm biology<br></li><li>self-referential humor most people won’t get<br></li><li>and probably some other stuff</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1228430/extras/a0314dc9cb71f37107ea1d9189626940.avif?t=1670244823\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><br>This game was developed as a student project at DigiPen Institute of Technology and was created for educational purposes only.
