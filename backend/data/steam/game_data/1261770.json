    "description": "Fairmoon Museum is an easy-going, collection-oriented life sim with a deep social system.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1261770/extras/8075296cea3e6f2a8a35e006ca3690fb.avif?t=1727404847\" width=600 height=140 /></span><br>Due to aggressive budget cuts, the Fairmoon Museum is in a bit of a sorry state. But that's okay! You've got no budget and you know absolutely no one in town. That's how all the best curators start! You'll just have to get creative.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong><i>Go fishin'.</i></strong> The ocean and the rivers and lakes are absolutely teeming with life! Why not fish some of it up for your museum? It's free! You don't even have to pay for 'em!<br></li><li><strong><i>Dig up fossils.</i></strong> Nobody owns the stuff in the dirt! You can just dig it up! Who's going to stop you? The cops? Not likely.<br></li><li><strong><i>Grow plants and get some animatronics.</i></strong> There's seeds everywhere! And hey, maybe you sell some of those fish and fossils and don't tell nobody. Then you can buy some mighty fine animatronics for the natural history wing!<br></li><li><strong><i>Acquire and restore fine art.</i></strong> Don't ask where they came from, just acquire them. Listen, nobody got anywhere in this world asking about how things got where they are. Plus, what're you gonna do, NOT acquire them?</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1261770/extras/bb428eedbc7de5dbc0c4e1c34e24c505.avif?t=1727404847\" width=600 height=140 /></span><br>It's a pretty small town, but that doesn't mean the people don't have a lot going on, right? Small towns usually have way more going on than you think and the residents of Fairmoon are no different. You'll probably have to talk to them to find out as peeking through windows is apparently illegal.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong><i>Choices Matter™</i></strong> Hey! They really do. Stop laughing! Being mean won't get you very far in Fairmoon, but being nice to everyone all the time won't necessarily work out either. The residents of Fairmoon all have their own personalities and existing relationships, some much less friendly than others.<br></li><li><strong><i>Improve local businesses.</i></strong> The gracious mayor in his infinite wisdom has seen fit to create the Fairmoon Consignment System. An automated system that resells your garbage! A portion of your garbage goes toward a fund that improves Fairmoon for all the tourism! Where <i>are</i> the tourists? Uhh...<br></li><li><strong><i>Find love?!</i></strong> One of those eighteen marriageable cuties in Fairmoon catch your eye? Well, that's a start. Now you're going to have to talk to them and hope you're eyecatching yourself. And it's not always as simple as  compliments and agreeing with everything they say.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1261770/extras/918b222168dd6ab7fea20d90e78edfef.avif?t=1727404847\" width=600 height=140 /></span><br>Life's not just about curating museums. It's about expressing yourself. And why should you have to settle for some run down little house? Why... you could have a <strong><i>MANSION</i></strong>! Two mansions even! Okay, not two. And the first one's really... I mean, mansion is coming on a bit strong.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong><i>Customize your house.</i></strong> House too small? Well, you can do something about that. And not just upgrading, you can freely customize the interior and exterior to your liking. Want a scenic yard full of nature stuff? Go nuts. Prefer a more trim, modern aesthetic? You do you.<br></li><li><strong><i>Expand your wardrobe.</i></strong> No need to keep your clothes on you at all times like some sort of animal. The fine folks at Stella's will deliver clothes you buy direct to your conveniently infinite home wardrobe. Or you can wear them out and they will deliver the clothes you were wearing to the wardrobe. Bit weird, but that's service!<br></li><li><strong><i>Get a haircut.</i></strong> Listen, we didn't want to say anything, but you're looking a bit sloppy. Maybe you head on down to DecoStylez and get a haircut. Ah, yeah, the owners are a bit particular about things, but don't worry about that. They're nice. Maybe a little judgmental sometimes, but who doesn't like a judgmental stylist? Right?</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1261770/extras/175ae5931ee838afffe49fd3c4039661.apng?t=1727404847\"><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1261770/extras/175ae5931ee838afffe49fd3c4039661.poster.avif?t=1727404847\" class=\"bb_img\" width=16 height=16 /></picture></span> L'il Bib says hello.",
