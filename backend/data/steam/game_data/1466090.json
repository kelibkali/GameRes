    "description": "Autumn 1881 - deep in the Thuringian forests lies the village of Rabenfels. From here a new epidemic spread over the whole country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou are a young doctor sent by the Imperial Office of Disease to investigate the origin of this mysterious disease.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDid Count Mergul, who resides high above the village, have anything to do with it, or his disreputable sister, who has retreated into the dark woods?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe villagers rumour that the Count is conducting sidelong experiments, that through his family a dark shadow has lain over the village for generations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut can that be, in such enlightened times like these? One thing is certain: nothing is as it seems - and you have come to this godforsaken village to reveal the riddle. Meanwhile the people around you are getting sick and dying.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGothic 1881 - a short narrative adventure in which you learn the secrets of a village, the hidden desires of its inhabitants. And in which you lift the thin veil of reality.",
