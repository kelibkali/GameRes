    "description": "The men of Blood Company are spread thin.  Supplies are short.  To win, you must be prepared.  Dig foxholes, build barriers, and set mines.  Use drones to keep a eye on the enemy, and bots to blow him to bits.  Fight in the burning sun, and on frigid, rainy, nights.  At Rip Creek you must use sound strategy and clean tactics to hold on and to drive the enemy back.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Battle of Rip Creek is a single player tactical strategy game with real-time combat and turn based strategy.",
