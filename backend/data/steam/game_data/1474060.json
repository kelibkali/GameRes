During combat chassis can be deformed and ripped apart exposing vital internal parts.<br></li><li><strong>Component placement</strong> is next step. Part types are, but not limited to: structural beams, motors, pistons, wheels, blunt, sharp &amp; other weapons, energy supplies, main-board and cosmetic parts. <br></li><li><strong>Input Control Setup</strong> allows to bind various actuator actions using keyboard, mouse and game-pad controllers.<br></li><li><strong>Bot Painting</strong> can be done both in-game and using your favorite painting software. Once your chassis shape is final, use implemented basic painting tools to paint bot. For more advanced designs just export &amp; import bot texture using &quot;.png&quot; format.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1474060/extras/f3d2f6e79054976186730a2f8a705a85.poster.avif?t=1734166340\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1474060/extras/f3d2f6e79054976186730a2f8a705a85.webm?t=1734166340\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1474060/extras/f3d2f6e79054976186730a2f8a705a85.mp4?t=1734166340\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >COMBAT AGAINST OTHER BOTS</h2>Participate in matches against other bots in various game modes.<br>Fight alone or with friends.<br>Cripple enemy machines by destroying key components such as wheels, motors, energy supplies, and main-board.<br>Use your weapons to shred your opponents apart.
