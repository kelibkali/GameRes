    "description": "An evil calculator has its normal arithmetic operators replaced with sadistically obscure functions. Using logic and a bit of algebra, you must work backwards to interpolate and use these corrupted operators to compute the 'number of the beast', 666, in order to purge the calculator of its demons and continue on. Non-profit and open-source, The Devil's Calculator is a highly original indie game that's as addicting as it is educational. Accessible to numberphiles and math novices alike, the first 20+ levels are 100% free to play and enjoy in the game's Demo.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><br>Each level has you decipher the function of a mysterious operator and use it to calculate the number of the beast to progress. The game features advanced graphing mechanics and access to various resources to help you interpolate and solve the innovative and creative function level design. As you progress in the game, players unlock the ability to create their own levels and play challenges others have created - including free DLC levels crafted by the game's creators, educators and mathematicians. With hand drawn artwork and a charming story, the Devil's Calculator is an addicting and gratifying puzzle experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Non-Profit</h2><br>The Devil's Calculator was made by Cinq-Mars Media is a 501(c)(3), a non-profit organization developing technology to support scientific research related to human safety and education, and to make such technology and research available on a charitable basis.",
