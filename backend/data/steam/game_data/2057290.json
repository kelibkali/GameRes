    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Heart of Darkness</h2>INTERFACE 3301 -- WEYLAND-YUTANI -- FROM NETWORK<br>COMCON NODE 1010141 -- EIJA33477975<br>MESSAGE BEGINS.<br>NEW LIFE DISCOVERED. CLASSIFICATION, EXTREMOPHILE. SERVICES REQUIRED. CONTRACT FOLLOWS.<br>AWAITING ACKNOWLEDGMENT...<br><i><br>The company found a new lifeform, and they want you to study it. Their offer's uncharacteristically generous--you catalog this organism, determine how they can use it, and bring it back so they can slap their patent on it. Fairly routine stuff. In exchange, they'll hook you up with a cushy corporate department head position, secure you a book deal, and make sure the institute of your choice gives you tenure. Did I mention the money? There's a lot of it. Simple survey, sample, and analysis job. Seemed too good to be true.</i><br><i><br>Of course it is.</i><br><strong><br>Heart of Darkness</strong><br>is a complete Cinematic Scenario for the ALIEN roleplaying game, written by sci-fi novelist Andrew E.C. Gaska. It is a stand-alone adventure, but also serves as a conclusion to the Draconis Strain Saga begun in the cinematic scenario<br><i>   Chariot of the Gods</i>   and continued in<br><i>   Destroyer of Worlds</i>   . The scenario is designed for 3-5 players plus the Game Mother, and is a spiraling descent into soul-crushing madness.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Aleksandar Velkov</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Alien Roleplaying Game ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
