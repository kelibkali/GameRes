    "description": "Based on a true story....<br><br><strong>Fat Dude Simulator</strong> is a third-person indie horror. The main character is a guy called Jack. He really likes eating a lot and is constantly eating something. This time he came to a forest to spend a couple of days far away from the city, out in the open air, where there are no people or noise, and what is more important, no fridge. However, it turns out that a frightful creature lives in that forest, and it starts hunting the main character. Now Jack has to rebuff the monster in order to survive.",
