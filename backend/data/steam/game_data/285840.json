GameCola Score: 9 - Excellent&quot;  <strong>GameCola</strong>  <i>June 2014</i><br><br>&quot;Overall I was very impressed by what Schell Games was able to achieve with a genre that is not really known for innovation. The game is addictive enough that you will want to complete it a few times in order to piece together the whole story and of course the co-op mode will also eat up a lot of your spare time if you have friends nearby. While shooter fans will obviously enjoy the game the most I urge anyone that has an interest in polished, unique titles to try it out as it is definitely worth the effort. Rating: 8/10&quot;  <strong>GAMERamble</strong>  <i>June 2014</i><br><br>&quot;Enemy Mind is an excellent and unique take on the shooter genre. Definitely worth the price at full retail.&quot;  <strong>Nerd Age</strong>  <i>June 2014</i><br><br>Check out our website: <br>Listen to the full soundtrack on our Bandcamp Page!<br>This old-school arcade shmup is brought to you by <i><strong>Schell Games</strong></i>, an independent game studio based in Pittsburgh, PA.",
