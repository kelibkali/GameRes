    "description": "FortressCraft Chapter 1 was released on April 8th, 2011. It went on to ship 1.4 million units and became the 7th-biggest selling digital title on the Xbox 360. Development was stopped due to Microsoft moving support away for the Xbox 360, and sadly the project was stopped.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is the anniversary edition of the long-awaited Content Patch 11. Never released on the Xbox 360, this patch brings FortressCraft : Chapter 1 up to date, with as many of the original features as is possible a decade later. Additionally, we have customisable character skins, Steam networking support, high resolution, massively increased draw distance, improved Custom support and multiple world support.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeaturing everything you loved on the original Xbox version - Design, build and explore your own a creative Microverse, design high-resolution workshop blocks, then share your Microverse with your friends - or the whole world!<br />\r\nVisitors help you rank up your world and earn carryable and placeable rewards and in turn can help you build or simply gawp at your design. Place dozens of unique high-resolution blocks, each with unique visual or gameplay feature, and make your mark on your own Microverse.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRelive the creative flow of a decade ago, download Chapter 1 and support development of FortressCraft : Phoenix!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd if you still have your old Xbox 360 world lying around, you can import it into the game!",
