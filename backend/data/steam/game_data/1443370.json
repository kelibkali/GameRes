Now 18, she journeys to <strong>Tirkin Fortress</strong>, determined to seal the dark power she set free and redeem herself for the destruction left in her wake. Villages lie in ruin. The dead walk. Monsters ravage the land. Only by surviving the horrors ahead can Mirenia hope to right her past mistakes. Armed with her trusted Shield Blade, Mirenia is close of undoing the mistakes of her past. Will she succeed or ultimately only make matters worse? </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1443370/extras/1c9e1487f97a35de870a789e80ff0035.avif?t=1765383284\" width=600 height=200 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>The Skylia Prophecy</i> is a <strong>linear</strong>, story-driven <strong>2D action RPG</strong> inspired by classic side-scrollers of the 8- and 16-bit eras. Exploration exists, but progression is mostly forward, without much backtracking. You’ll fight your way through  hand-crafted areas, conquer punishing bosses, and uncover secrets that reward careful players.</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Old-school difficulty</strong>: Inspired by the ‘tough but fair’ design philosophy of Souls-like games. Mistakes are punished, but perseverance is rewarded.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>No grinding required</strong>: Smart play and talking to NPCs will earn you upgrades that make the final stretch easier; if you put in the effort.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Combat requires patience</strong>: You have the Shield Blade, magic, and reflexes. Thinking matters more than button-mashing.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Retro presentation</strong>: Gorgeous pixel art, atmospheric music, and a tone that evokes classic dark fantasy RPGs. </p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >-------------------------------</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>This is not a Metroidvania.</strong> While you’ll revisit towns and find hidden areas, progression is mostly linear. This is a focused, retro-style RPG experience with modern influences; built to challenge and reward the old-school gamer. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Please read the instruction manual if you require assistance. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >If you buy this game, you get the game &quot;The Masked Mage&quot; for a very reduced price. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >------------------------------- </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Controller Information:</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Due to limitations with the engine, some controllers may not work properly.
