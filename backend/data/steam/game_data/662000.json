Binary systems, black holes, wormholes, pulsars &amp; more play host to various hostile and friendly locations! </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Fully Customisable Worlds</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Each planet, moon, asteroid cluster and gas giant can be modified and manipulated to your needs.

The cosmos in Startron is large, but not so large a single person couldn't get to most of it. The planetscapes and moonscapes follow a similar philosophy where there's plenty of space to do what you need, but not so much that it feels irrelevant. We hope we've got the balance just right! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The art style was chosen for similar reasons, as we found it affords players (and developers alike) more creative control to produce something truly wonderous.</p>",
