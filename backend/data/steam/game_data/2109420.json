    "description": "<i>Once upon a time, humankind and demonkind lived in harmony. The two represented equal parts of a natural balance, a relationship built on humanity’s call for order and stability and a demon’s love for change and chaos<br>In this period of peace, any human and demon could create a “Pact,” a bond strengthened by mutual trust and respect.  This union imbued the alliance with an unimaginable power that far surpassed even the strongest of men and fiends.<br>This phenomenon was called &quot;The Warlock&quot;<br><br>But, even as the two civilizations remained civil and flourished, there were those that scoffed at the alliance and sought to destroy it. From this hate and weariness rose the Church of Humanity.<br>The congregation advocated that humankind was the pinnacle of evolution, and launched a crusade to destroy all demons, their supporters, and the powerful Warlocks. In a world without war, this was a massacre.<br><br><br>While some took up arms to push back against the church,many warlocks hoped reason would prevail. They used a powerful ritual, sacrificing parts of their power to sink themselves into a magical slumber and seal their knowledge and secrets deep in the crypts below blood-soaked soil.<br>You were one of those pairs, hidden from your persecutors and shielded from the hands of time. You expected to wake up to peace, but upon emerging from your tomb, you could feel the weight of a different world. One built on the bodies of your kin.</i><br><br><strong>NOTE : This game is multiplayer only. An internet connection is required and a working PC-compatible microphone is greatly recommended.</strong><br><br>---------<br><br><i>Pactus</i> is a Cooperative puzzle adventure. Two players are trapped inside a cathedral and must act together to escape.<br><br><strong>2 players' cooperation</strong>: Every puzzle in Pactus is made to be solved by two people. Everyone got a role to play.<br><br><strong>Communicate</strong>: Keep talking. Some places are only accessible by one of you and describing what you see will be the key to your escape.<br><br><strong>Asymmetric gameplay</strong>: Both character play differently. Either sneak around as the Wendigo or blast your way through with the Magician. You will experience different locations as part of your shared adventure<br><br><strong>Hidden secrets</strong>: Some parts of the cathedral are hidden from view. Searching and sometimes backtracking will reveal more",
