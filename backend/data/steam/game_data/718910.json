Quickly Sepsiman approaches this girl and gave her the power to transform into a &quot;soda girl&quot; with his Sepsi bracelet.<br><br>WHAT HAPPENED?! Instead of a soda girl, she cleansed the toxins of the Sepsi Soda and became<strong> VITAMIN GIRL!</strong> Sepsiman life it's a stake anyways... sad.<br><br>Anyways, it's up to VG to cleanse the Koko Cola from this world or even this galaxy! She will clash with Kokoman and Kokogirl and cleanse the toxins running around the  the world.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/718910/extras/76a902fea38d6f6e8ca90e189e922dd6.avif?t=1710704363\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br>-Cute super hero and villain girls doing cute things<br>-Insane difficulty<br>-Arcade Mode, if you have no lives left, you have to start from the start<br>-Nightmare Mode, unlocked after you finish Arcade, a harder version of the game<br>-20 levels lovely handcrafted so the player can enjoy this ride<br>-10 levels in arcade mode and 10 levels in Nightmare mode<br>-Gallery mode, unlock concept art collecting 100/100 cans on each stage.<br>-Did I mention cute girls?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/718910/extras/439bd949832175ed54f550f06a772dce.avif?t=1710704363\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br>Vitamin Girl is a throwback to the old runner and high speed classics. Instead of a generic endless runner, <strong>VG has levels completely handmade, not an inch of this game is random generated</strong>, every level was created with care to make the player throw the controller to the screen! (Please don't do that...)<br>And not only that, to expand this game even more, it's made to not only run but you also have different modes, <strong>slide down the city with a Hover-board, free roam some levels, and even ride a bike</strong>!<br><br>-Vitamin A Mode: Ride your Armadillo bike, A-kun, and drive through The Soda Way to Kokoman's lair.<br>-Vitamin C Mode: Run, jump, slide down! Run to the goal!<br>-Vitamin E Mode: Ride you Hover-board and slide down through the city and other places to reach your goal!<br>-Vitamin D Mode: Free roam the levels and find the exit.",
