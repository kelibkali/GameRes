Rebooting after hibernation, two super-intelligent AI cores awake to find themselves installed within a couple of old security drones. Their attempts to uncover what occurred may end up becoming a lower priority than merely surviving... <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/524130/extras/c6f2af9541b29344b71e1f903bd638bb.avif?t=1474045622\" width=533 height=114 /></span><br><br>Lots of robots, lots of lasers, lots of aliens, lots of explosions! The numerous retro arcade influences are front and center, but spiced up with a colorful modern style, a generous helping of sci-fi intrigue, and a dash of RPG ELEMENTS!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Don't fight alone! Up to 4 players can battle together in local co-op, but you'll always have your trusty (AI-controlled) robo-buddies by your side.<br></li><li>Story mode sees you battle through a ton of handcrafted levels as you attempt to shed light on the calamity that befell the colony.<br></li><li>Arcade mode is a straight up arena-shooter, where you battle wave after endless wave of the alien horde.<br></li><li>Versus mode pits you against up to 3 friends (or AI controlled bots - If your friends are wasting their time doing something other than playing Dual Core).</li></ul><br>This is a demo version of Dual Core, and has limited content. Arcade mode is time-limited.  <br><br>A gamepad is recommended, but full mouse &amp; keyboard controls (customisable) are available.",
