In the game, we will have to sabotage the actions of the Egyptians so that we can save as many of our countrymen as possible. For this, we will have to use both earthly methods and the powers received from God.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465620/extras/d3d8550a918772a7b1949d7f9d403803.poster.avif?t=1725032683\" width=600 height=214 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465620/extras/d3d8550a918772a7b1949d7f9d403803.webm?t=1725032683\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465620/extras/d3d8550a918772a7b1949d7f9d403803.mp4?t=1725032683\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>An important aspect of the game is raising the &quot;morale&quot; of the Israelites and lowering the &quot;morale&quot; of the Egyptians. To do this, we will move through the territory of ancient Egypt, find oppressed compatriots, and help them in various ways. We will have to find food to feed the hungry, we will free those locked in cages, we will bring medicines for the sick, and we will also fight to protect the weak.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465620/extras/f55d38b894258715bb513a047f62c812.poster.avif?t=1725032683\" width=600 height=214 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465620/extras/f55d38b894258715bb513a047f62c812.webm?t=1725032683\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465620/extras/f55d38b894258715bb513a047f62c812.mp4?t=1725032683\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>In the game, we will unlock powers received from God with time, the main of which is the ability to plague Egypt so that the morale of Egyptians will drop to such a level that we can bring out oppressed Israelites. We will have at our disposal all 10 plagues that appeared in the Bible: the transformation of the waters of the Nile and all the waters of Egypt into blood, frogs, lice, flies, the plague of cattle, ulcers, hail, locusts, darkness, and the death of the firstborn. <br> <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465620/extras/563c9676f525f628210cc85ffbb49e17.poster.avif?t=1725032683\" width=600 height=214 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465620/extras/563c9676f525f628210cc85ffbb49e17.webm?t=1725032683\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465620/extras/563c9676f525f628210cc85ffbb49e17.mp4?t=1725032683\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Another aspect of the game will be to lead the Egyptians to the promised land and save them from the approaching army.
