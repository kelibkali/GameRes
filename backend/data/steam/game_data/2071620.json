It should be a simple enough test - <strong>EXCEPT </strong>you can't remember anything! Not to mention that the recipe book has been mysteriously destroyed and the storage room is a mess!<br><br>It'll be tricky, but not impossible, to make it through the day. Just don't let anyone see you sweat as you gather ingredients and figure out how to brew potions...<strong>BUT</strong> is the customer always right about what they want to order?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >KEY FEATURES:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Explore the shop at your own pace</strong>—there’s no need to rush! Take a moment to pet the cats at the very least.<br><br></li><li><strong>Gather ingredients and search for recipe pages </strong>scattered around. Solve the casual puzzle of potion crafting. <br><br></li><li><strong>Chat with a fantasy cast of customers. </strong> Talk as little or as much as you'd like. <br><br></li><li><strong>Sell potions </strong>and see where your choices lead you—experience<strong> multiple outcomes each playthrough.  </strong><br></li><li>A <strong>laid-back, magical time to be had </strong>with plenty of dumb jokes. </li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2071620/extras/4d902ec90f0e6ac926af51f21570fbfe.avif?t=1743803739\" width=640 height=268 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >FOLLOW GAME DEVELOPMENT ON TIKTOK:</h2>Tag along as I bring this indie game to life in an earthly realm near you!<br><br><br><br><i>Thanks for reading!
