By hitting the enemy plane you get plastic parts which you can use to buy new weapons. After each round you are earning experience points. Once you level up, you will be getting new planes. The game style is inspired by movies like &quot;Toy Story&quot; or &quot;Monster INC.&quot;. The environment is colorful and adventurous.",
