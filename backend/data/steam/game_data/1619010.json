    "description": "From acclaimed composer Ben Prunty, the <strong>Subnautica: Below Zero</strong> Original Soundtrack takes you through the sublime atmosphere of the frozen regions of Planet 4546B in a remarkable musical experience. This incredible 54-track album beautifully captures the vastness and wonder of adventuring through the depths of <strong>Subnautica: Below Zero</strong>. <br><br><i>“This is the complete soundtrack for Subnautica Below Zero. Many tracks have been expanded and nearly all have been specially mastered for the album. Vintage synths, kalimba, granular synthesis, lots of reverb, and the occasional waterphone all come together to evoke the mystery and loneliness of Planet 4546b. At over 2 hours, this is the largest soundtrack I've ever made, and certainly it's the most fun I've had doing it.” - Composer Ben Prunty</i>",
