    "description": "Slime Climb is a bouncy and approachable pixel platformer, made by a single developer. You play as a little blue slime who's escaped their jar in the middle of a storm, and must make your way out of the tower. There are more than twenty stages, and more friendly slimes to find and rescue as you make your escape.",
