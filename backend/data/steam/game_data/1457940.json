What happens when you suddenly have to leave? Can you find a new one, in this world or perhaps another? The episode is haunted by questions of responsibility, by relationship with mother and motherland, by the artifacts that carry our stories in times of crisis. What do we keep with us, what do we leave behind...and what can we translate into the virtual world?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>A Playable Nightmare</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The game drops you into eerie but familiar dreamscapes: apocalypse, returning to a childhood home, disappearing staircases, sluggish limbs, losing your voice, everything a storm.
