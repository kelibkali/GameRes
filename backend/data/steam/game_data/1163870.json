Mecha Knights is my attempt to create the Mech game I always wanted to play. I've wanted to combine the elements from games like Armored Core, Front Mission, Earth Defence Force and even Resident Evil, in an apocalyptic war theme that could be seen in anime series such as Muv:Luv and Blue Gender. A game where it's not just you, the player, that is winning the whole war as a one-man army, but rather that you take part in larger operations – where you and your allies fight hundreds of enemies. A game where extensive customization and progression allows you to develop your own Mech, while the game keeps you engaged with the story of the soldiers.",
