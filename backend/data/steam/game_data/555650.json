    "description": "From Nashville to New York, It's 800 miles of love.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmanda Etheridge is just an average, closeted lesbian working at an advertising agency in New York... At least until the huge project she was in charge of collapsed through no fault of her own.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow the former workaholic has been put on paid leave, but without her work, what is there for her to do? Well, her boss did tell her to get out, meet people, and expand her horizons...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGuided by the country songs on the radio, she travels to Nashville alone. Reluctantly leaving her old life behind, she arrives in this colorful, musical city -- and hears the whisper of an angel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Hello, Nashville. Would you like to hear a song about love?&quot;",
