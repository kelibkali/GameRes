Based heavily on the dialogues and personalities of the main characters, it dramatically evolves with the game’s plot itself. A brainchild of Princess &amp; Ivan Holodov (Crematorium Sound Design project), it gives the pixelated universe of Odysseus Kosmos that specific nostalgic feel when space travel was the biggest news around the world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1065370/extras/ebd719411dc832087722f677d4938707.avif?t=1768393060\" width=624 height=188 /></span></p>",
