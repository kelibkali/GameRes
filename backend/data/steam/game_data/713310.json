You control the Gambol Gumball through a gauntlet of levels designed with flow and rhythm in mind to test your platforming grit.  But don't be too nervous, because along with the slick controls you also have a triple jump that's energy is reset upon touching any (non-lethal) surface, including the ceiling.  Holy cow, that sounds great.  The controls are simple enough that you could play it on a NES controller, with only run, jump, left, right, down-boost, and [REDACTED] to worry about. What's that “[REDACTED]” all about?  Hah, don't think too much about it, it's probably nothing.<br><br><br>      “Whoa!” you say, “this looks crazy hard, is this one of those games that Poo-Dee-Pah yells at on the YouVideo?”  Nah, it's not too bad, the levels appear a bit tougher than they really are since I had to put in more obstacles to make up for all that sweet, juicy, player agency you have. Oh, and when you inevitably meet your demise at the hands of a spike, laser, bomb, floating-shock-ball-of-hurt, or whatever else, you re-spawn within a couple seconds (or just hit the level-restart button if you're fidgety like me), so it's no biggie if you have to re-run a level a few times before you get the hang of it.  But for all you hardcore platforming buffs out there, I've made a second, harder difficulty with special levels, and normal mode levels with more hazards added.  Oh my!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/713310/extras/0ba1b19d79f9375256e8f3245164a010.avif?t=1601581976\" width=303 height=144 /></span></h2>      Inconsequential!  It's probably about candy or jellybeans or some such nonsense.  Honestly, the story is just a vehicle to move the action along, so it's not super important, but I'll work something in there, just you see, and chapter four will <i>shock</i> you!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/713310/extras/9760cd0f543e955741c73a01042618c5.avif?t=1601581976\" width=358 height=112 /></span></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>super-smooth Modern Platforming Action!</strong><br></li><li><strong>A triple jump that's energy is reset upon collision with any non-lethal surface.</strong>  Wowie!<br></li><li><strong>130+  Levels</strong>, designed to flow in a way so that they can be (fairly) easily speedran once mastered NO AUTOSCROLLERS! !<br></li><li><strong>Wild hazards to avoid!</strong>, and one to use to your advantage if you're gutsy enough to experiment (hint: not the spikes, those just kill you.  Don't try using those for anything.  Except to die.  Which you will do if you touch them.  Avoid at all costs).<br></li><li><strong>No weird gravity mechanics</strong>, or things to make you motion sick.

It is possible (though not promised) that Linux and Mac versions may come in the future, though they will certainly <strong>not </strong>be available at launch.<br><br>Q: How Many People Are Working On This Game?<br>A: Just this guy!, Mike.  Catch me on the Tweeterverse @ACEJester &lt;3  Oh, and Andrew Lippens is the composer.  He's super cool, too.<br><br>Q:  What Inspired Gambol?<br>A:  I love games with wall-jumping, but I haven't found one with the mechanic done how I'd like it done, so I've made my own!",
