Game will be depending on the community to give me feedback about what's interesting and what's not, and thank you in advance for giving me a shot! <br />\r\nHowever, I gonna say, I really enjoy destroying of hordes of enemies and I've noticed that there are not many such kind of games.<br />\r\nI've started creating this project as an experiment, and I also have learned a lot as the game grows. I am glad that now i can share it with you. It will help to develop it faster.",
