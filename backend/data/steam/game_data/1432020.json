    "description": "There was an aye-aye behind the bar, staring at me horribly. Or maybe its face just froze that way. I was waiting for my client at ten at night in a dusty, dirty town in the middle of nowhere. Clouds out here were apparently one of the thirty million newly unemployed. There was a missing woman and my client was about to hire an amateur private detective with the world's most technologically advanced cellular phone. This was going to be a cinch. Seriously. It'll take me like two searches with it to close this case. Three if mid-investigation I check on my torrents.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nY-You're a player of text adventures on Steam. I'm Jay. Let's straddle the edge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Advanced text parser that understands real English words and sentences. <br />\r\n* Fully customizable fonts and colors for background and game text!<br />\r\n* Cloud saves<br />\r\n* An auto-restore feature that takes you to your last saved move when you begin a new play session.",
