    "description": "Wreck the Insects - An arcade-style shootem' up with a floral twist!<br />\r\nPlay as Lilly, your average everyday overweight cat who wishes to have the best garden around! However, disaster strikes. Hoards upon hoards of unique, crazy types of insects begin to swarm around poor Lilly's garden, like a fly to a light! Or in this case,  a fly to a flower.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLilly does not have her own life bar-instead, a player's goal is to defend the flowers at the bottom of the screen. There are many ways to achieve this, and it's up to you to find out the best methods for exterminating these creatures!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Play through the story mode, complete with fully-animated cutscenes, and be introduced to each type of insect the game has to offer!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Fight against large boss fight bugs- which brings the biggest challenges to Lilly's adventure!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Play through an endless arcade mode-where bugs endlessly spawn for you to exterminate! <br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Play the bonus rounds, where you try to shoot pink targets before they disappear! The higher the score, the more health your flowers will have the next round.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2019, M3NOS Games.",
