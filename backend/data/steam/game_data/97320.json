    "description": "<p>Liliana Vess’s fully unlocked “Grave Whispers” black deck for Magic: The Gathering — Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012. Long ago, Liliana made a deal to guarantee long-lasting life and beauty. Now, she specializes in necromancy: spells that reanimate the dead and unlock power from death. Harness that power by mastering a horde of zombies, skeletons, and other ghoulish creations. Cripple your opponent with discard spells, then bring their best creatures back from the dead to fight for you.</p>\n<p>(Contains no new content.
