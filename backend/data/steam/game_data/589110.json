    "description": "<strong><u>The Hallway - Now Available!</u></strong><br><br>Do you have what it takes to escape? Constricted VR is a fully immersive Escape-The-Room style game exclusively for the HTC Vive. Beginning in a central hub, you can select from two different escape rooms with varying themes and puzzles. From the basement of a psychopath to a mysterious hallway, the environments are different and exciting. You may even discover some secrets while exploring both escape rooms. Please note that this game is not meant to be easy, so you must use every ounce of your deductive skills to escape each room!",
