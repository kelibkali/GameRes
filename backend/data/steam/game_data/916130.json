    "description": "Ever worked hundreds of meters beneath the earth, bent down in dark, narrow shafts, hitting coal out of the walls? Probably not. Now you can: The WDR, Germany’s largest public broadcaster, presents the interactive VR experience “Meet the Miner – WDR VR Bergwerk”. With an Oculus Rift, users can experience how dangerous and grueling life of a miner was 100 years ago – feeling what it was like racing down hundreds of meters into the earth in a shaky elevator and mining coal with a virtual pickaxe. Something you will never be able to do in real life again. It is the highlight of a VR/360° project focussing on a dying tradition – the last German coal mines will be shut down at the end of 2018.",
