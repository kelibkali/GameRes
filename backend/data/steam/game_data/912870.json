    "description": "<strong>V-Aria – a journey through the Bayerische Staatsoper</strong><br><br>Immerse yourself for three minutes in the scintillating world of opera! On a red velvet chair from Munich's Nationaltheater you'll travel with the aid of VR glasses through the opera house, meeting musicians, dancers and magnificent singers. You'll also discover wonderful music, splendid halls and bizarre figures. You'll travel to places which would otherwise be out of bounds, singers give you a private performance on the stage, and at the end you personally receive the applause of more than 2,000 viewers. Bravo!",
