    "description": "In this first chapter, play as Connor, the unique prototype android serving the Detroit police department and face a deviant android who has taken a little girl hostage. Look for clues, investigate the crime scene and choose your approach wisely as each of your actions will affect the outcome of the mission and bring you to one of the six different endings for this chapter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDetroit: Become Human, the latest and most ambitious video game production from Quantic Dream, is finally coming to Steam! Featuring world-renowned actors including Jesse Williams (Grey’s Anatomy), Clancy Brown (Carnivale), Lance Henriksen (Aliens), Bryan Dechart (True Blood) and Valorie Curry (Twilight).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWHAT MAKES US HUMAN?<br />\r\nDetroit 2038. Technology has evolved to a point where human like androids are everywhere. They speak, move and behave like human beings, but they are only machines serving humans.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay three distinct androids and see a world at the brink of chaos – perhaps our future - through their eyes. Your very decisions will dramatically alter how the game’s intense, branching narrative plays out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will face moral dilemmas and decide who lives or dies. With thousands of choices and dozens of possible endings, how will you affect the future of Detroit and humanity’s destiny?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKEY FEATURES<br />\r\nPLAY YOUR PART IN A GRIPPING NARRATIVE – Enter a world where moral dilemmas and difficult decisions can turn android slaves into world-changing revolutionaries. Discover what it means to be human from the perspective of an outsider – and see the world through the eyes of a machine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHEIR LIVES, YOUR CHOICES – Shape an ambitious branching narrative, where your decisions not only determine the fate of the three main characters, but that of the entire city of Detroit. How you control Kara, Connor and Markus can mean life or death – and if one of them pays the ultimate price, the story still continues…<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCOUNTLESS PATHS, COUNTLESS ENDINGS – Every decision you make, no matter how minute, affects the outcome of the story. No playthrough will be exactly the same: replay again and again to discover a totally different conclusion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFULLY OPTIMIZED FOR PC – Previously only available on PlayStation® 4, Detroit: Become Human is brought to PC with stunning graphics, 4K resolution, 60 fps framerate and full integration of both mouse/keyboard and gamepad controls for the most complete Detroit: Become Human experience to date.",
