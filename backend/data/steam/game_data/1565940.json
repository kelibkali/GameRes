    "description": "<i><strong>Maya Treasures</strong> </i>- a game in the well-known genre &quot;three-in-a-row&quot;, made in bright hand-drawn graphics.<br>In this game there are 30 levels that you need to go through collecting points by connecting jewels in rows of three or more identical stones. Also, it contains boosters (dynamite, gem, removing a whole row), which can be activated by collecting a combination with them. They will noticeably speed up the set of points at the levels, because time must be appreciated, it is limited.",
