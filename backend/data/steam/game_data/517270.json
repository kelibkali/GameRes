    "description": "<strong>Create your farm from top to bottom !</strong> Build, grow, manage and become a virtual competent and reknown farmer.<br><br><strong>Explore </strong>wild territories, create and develop a fantastic agricultural land. Each new game comes with its own unique features (landscaping, vegetation, rivers, and soil composition); you develop it according to your wants, needs and strategic goals. You choose where to place your buildings, build roads, locate your plots, and so on…<br><br><strong>Raise </strong>one or several animal species (several breeds per type) :<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Cow<br></li><li>Pig<br></li><li>Goat<br></li><li>Sheep<br></li><li>Poultry</li></ul><br>You job is to feed/water the animals, add litter, remove the manure, all for their happiness and well-being. And also to avoid disease, or worse, deaths. In return, they will give you milk, eggs, as well as meat when you’re selling them to the slaughterhouse. Thanks to genetics and reproduction, you can expand your herds and improve animal’s genes and quality.<br><br><strong>Create your plots</strong>, grow and harvest them to feed your animals. No animals? Not a problem, sell your production directly to the cooperative, or to another player (multiplayer mode). How about storing it and selling it later when the market prices are higher? A good harvest means planting with the right season, and using adequate farm equipments to work your land. You’ll also have to deal with weather conditions (sunshine, rainfall, various temperatures…), and to be reactive if your crops become diseased. Your success will depend on you’re making the right decisions at the right time.<br><br><strong>Access a selection of more than 30 different types of equipment</strong>, with more than a 100 accurate 3D models, which you can customise (colours, accessories) to your preference. You choose the equipment according to your needs; if the investment is too heavy, you can always buy second-hand or buy with other players (using farm grouping). With this equipment, you’ll be able to work effectively on your plots of land, and grow your livestock. Select one, choose an action, and intuitively manage all your work in your virtual farm!<br><br><br><strong>Game mode :</strong><br><br><u>Single player :</u><br><br>You play on your own, the world is not perpetual (time stops whenever you save and quit the game).

In that game mode, 1 day is 6 hours – real time (time runs a 4 times faster). In that way, a month in the game is 28 virtual days (7 days – real time): it starts on Monday (at 0:00 am) to end on Sunday (at midnight).<br></li><li>Buying/selling farm equipment, livestock, goods among players (vs. computer)<br></li><li>Buying farm equipment with others players (group purchasing)<br></li><li>Challenge other players in genetic competitions with your top animals<br></li><li>Exchange with other players through the mailbox</li></ul>",
