Together, Carlos (programmer) and Max (artist) share a taste for sims and classic gameplay -- which is easy to see in <i>The Spatials</i>, their first project. Inspired by the great classic sim games of the '90s, <i>The Spatials</i> combines classic base-building gameplay (based on isometric tile room building) with a real-time combat system and an exploration campaign. After publishing version 1.0 in mid 2014, Carlos and Max saw the potential of their idea and developed a much improved second version with Early Access starting in August 2014.  In October 2014, the game was approved for release on Steam. In 2015, <i>The Spatials</i> continued to grow in popularity -- featured in Let's Plays from YouTubers and articles in major sites such as <i>Rock Paper Shotgun</i>.",
