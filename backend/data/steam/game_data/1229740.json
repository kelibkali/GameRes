    "description": "Set in the Black Hills of South Dakota, this interactive VR documentary takes participants into the subterranean depths of Sanford Research Lab and Wind Cave as they unravel the cosmos from different angles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nParticipants are invited to navigate the former Homestake Goldmine turned cutting-edge laboratory 4,850 feet below ground, where scientists employ a cosmic microphone to investigate the nature of dark matter. In tandem, the story also takes participants into the vast underground network of Wind Cave, the labyrinth of ancient passageways at the heart of the Lakota Sioux creation story. Both spaces transport us into a realm of sheer darkness as they explore what lies beyond light. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing volumetric video capture technologies that see beyond the spectrum of visible lights, this immersive documentary crafts a dialogue between the scientific frontier and a realm of spiritual belief that co-exist in the storied Black Hills. As the diptych emerges in this interactive narrative, visitors to the underground are turned inwards to find their common ground.",
