    "description": "In a retro, monochrome fantasy landscape, the white sage Jericho has employed you to stop the local warlock from reviving an ancient evil. Is it up to you, the Warp Soldier, to put an end to his dark ritual. With your vast movepool, unadulterated ferocity, a few movement gimmicks, and tiny peglegs, do you have what it takes to end the warlock's army before they put an end to you?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1670980/extras/a148a04261a525fd651cd2e8abfb6723.poster.avif?t=1654979629\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1670980/extras/a148a04261a525fd651cd2e8abfb6723.webm?t=1654979629\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1670980/extras/a148a04261a525fd651cd2e8abfb6723.mp4?t=1654979629\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >EXPLORE A VAST, RETRO, INTERCONNECTED WORLD</h2>While the land lacks in color, the world the Warp Soldier must trek features several ecosystems, all authentically scored with the chippiest of tunes. Backtracking is rewarded but seldom feels like a chore with the powers the player will come across.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A MURDEROUS, ENCAPTIVATING CAST</h2>Not only is the cast of cannon fodder charming and varied, but many of the bigger baddies you come across will have character arcs of their own. Whether the warlock's headliner henchmen become your bitter rivals or eventual allies will depend on how you express yourself during combat. If tasteful violence versus fierce foes isn't your forte, there are some NPCs scattered about who may be able to help you with a sidequest or two.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >COMBO CANVAS - SHOUNEN STYLE</h2>While your sword and swift kicks are already devastating on their own, your ability to teleport next to foes you've tagged with warp-strikes lets you extend your melee combos and air-juggles like only an anime protagonist can!",
