    "description": "<strong>RUBICON</strong> is a local multiplayer battle arena merging the simple fun of classic couch co-op with a few brand-new twists - figuratively and literally! As fans of head-to-head shooters from the late 90s and early 2000s, our vision is all about rekindling the appeal and nostalgia of playing a game with your buddies in the living room. RUBICON is jam-packed with exciting gameplay features purposefully designed to build an explosive party atmosphere where anything can happen and every round has something new and different. You might get, say, a powered-up shotgun that fires 15 massive missiles with a single trigger pull; on the other hand, you might find yourself pitted against an invisible enemy with a sniper rifle or an adversary whose protective shield's utility is hampered by the fact that he's ballooned to twice his original size. A new weapon every round and a new special modifier after each point means hours upon hours of good old-fashioned fun.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >FEATURES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Splitscreen couch PvP action for 2 or 4 players</li><li>A randomized, constantly shuffling arena with over 40 quintillion possible configurations</li><li>A deeply seductive and context-responsive announcer with over 400 recorded dialogues</li><li>12 unique and stacking gameplay modifiers, from supercharged bullets to health vampirism</li><li>6 randomly assigned and tactically distinct weapons, from shotguns to missile launchers</li><li>Full Remote Play Together and Parsec support</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >RULES OF ENGAGEMENT</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1243370/extras/0527e6fee272c522a740951f16f6ea7b.avif?t=1598889563\" width=617 height=347 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1243370/extras/d8e4167372e56f8343aaad99ffed4d90.avif?t=1598889563\" width=617 height=347 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1243370/extras/bc832818a80f914ea7dce717ecb7a2ee.avif?t=1598889563\" width=617 height=347 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1243370/extras/d0703d952825e252e1767d5ebd22f2ba.avif?t=1598889563\" width=617 height=347 /></span>",
