    "description": "🚂 Soko Loco Deluxe is a cute train tycoon!<br><br>In the game, you'll place tracks and buildings, assign workers and make train schedules. Collect planks, bricks and steel to build more infrastructure, and feed towns to grow their population. Over time, natural resources will deplete, so you'll have to think one step ahead to keep up the production flow. Can you complete the enormous, final monument?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1003730/extras/e205e34027d37f8a2de007f6b9271e6d.poster.avif?t=1639493377\" width=560 height=280 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1003730/extras/e205e34027d37f8a2de007f6b9271e6d.webm?t=1639493377\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1003730/extras/e205e34027d37f8a2de007f6b9271e6d.mp4?t=1639493377\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 📍  Campaign with 20+ levels over 5+ worlds<br></li><li>🧱 8 kinds of cargo, 10+ different buildings<br></li><li>🏠 Cities and population growth<br></li><li>🎢 Build tunnels, bridges, signals and more<br></li><li>🗺️ Scenario editor with Steam Workshop integration<br></li><li>🏆 Online high-scores</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Quick &amp; Simple</h2>Learning the game will take you less than an hour thanks to its intuitive and simple controls.
