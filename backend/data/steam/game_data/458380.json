    "description": "The year is 1908. The 20th century is still young.<br />\r\nAn unfamiliar 20th century - in an unfamiliar world.<br />\r\nThis is a world that experienced a 19th century very different from our own. A world filled with innumerable steam-powered Engines. <br />\r\nThe unnaturally rapid development of this steam civilization has left the world's skies shrouded in grey... and its seas dyed in shades of black.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Sea&quot; - Once, the word suggested an expanse of blue. Today, it refers to something dark and putrid.<br />\r\nThe former harbor city of Marseille in the European Kingdom of France looks out on a sea as black as any other. But these particular waters are home to something that can't be found anywhere else on Earth...<br />\r\nA massive artificial island, solid and imposing as a fortress. A city in its own right, but also a school; a place bursting with life and color.<br />\r\nIts formal name: The Marseille Offshore Academia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Academia - a city founded on cutting-edge engine science; an academy designed to produce the greatest Erudite Scholars in the world. <br />\r\nIt stands above a sea fouled by the flourishing of modern civilization.<br />\r\nIt sits below a sky polluted by the emissions of countless Engines.<br />\r\nAnd nonetheless, it shines like a jewel, filled with the radiance of students glorying in their youth.<br />\r\nThis is a place so overflowing with energy as to recall the long-lost sun.<br />\r\nA place that glitters with a beauty reminiscent of the long-lost stars.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, the Academia is also a city with a secret. Beneath its facade hides a darkness feared even by the French monarchy.<br />\r\nSpecifically... the school lies under the control of the &quot;English West India Company,&quot; a secret society that rules Europe's underworld with an iron first.<br />\r\nNot even the agencies of the great European powers could expose the Academia's true nature; powerless to interfere, heads of mighty states can only watch warily for some sign that might reveal the Society's intentions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Academia - a gorgeous island closed off completely to the outside world.<br />\r\nA school that no student is permitted to leave, except as successful &quot;graduates.&quot;<br />\r\nA society of the young and for the young, self-sufficient and proudly independent.<br />\r\nA city-state under the absolute rule of the &quot;Governing Council,&quot; an elite body composed of the &quot;Fraternity&quot; and &quot;Sorority&quot;... and a subordinate branch of the English West India Company.<br />\r\nA radiant distortion in the fabric of the world, continually producing both brilliant young talent and fearsome supernatural Arts.<br />\r\nA carefully-cultivated, absolutely impenetrable garden of secrets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, in the spring of 1908... A single young man appears within its walls.<br />\r\nAfter declaring his intent to wage war against the Governing Council, he introduces himself in this way:<br />\r\n&quot;Nikola Tesla. 72 years old. I'm a transfer student.&quot;<br />\r\n&quot;Students of the Marseille Offshore Academia. My hundred thousand young friends, cursed by fate.&quot;<br />\r\n&quot;...I will save every last one of you with my own two hands.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd at the summit of Château d'If, a bell rings out.<br />\r\nThe Bell of Gahkthun, announcing that the time of rejoicing is at hand...",
