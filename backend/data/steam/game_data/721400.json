    "description": "Have you ever actually run while playing runners? Or you just sit and watch your character run on a smartphone screen without burning any single calorie? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow you have a chance to experience some-thing completely new, run your character through troubles, while actually run with your VR headset on. Run, evade obstacles and throw your weapons to everything your eye catches. Sometimes it would be a policeman, sometimes — a neighbour’s car. But what the most important is — you would have to run. Run for your life. Challenge yourself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey features:<br />\r\nSay no to buttons and sticks! Grab your Vive controllers and run!<br />\r\nInfinite (Literally. The world is procedurally generated, there is no end) action!<br />\r\nUnbelievable projectile weapons — you can throw footballs, hot dogs, even fresh fish!<br />\r\nShow everyone how cool you are with global highscores and embedded fitness-tracking! Track your calories and distance. Get your body ready for beach vacation, without removing your HMD.<br />\r\nStylish graphics — no ugly cubes and flat textures!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe are looking forward to your suggestions on what else we can add for you to have even more fun.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSupport us now! Tell your friends!",
