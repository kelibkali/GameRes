    "description": "The Zeta Orbital is a first-person sci-fi exploration game set on an abandoned research station orbiting an alien planet. Explore the station, uncovering clues to the crew’s mysterious disappearance. They found something on the planet, and brought it back to orbit — but what else did they bring with it?<br><br>Welcome to The Zeta Orbital. Can you find the answers, navigate the station, and scavenge enough resources to escape?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A Rogue-(like)-like</h2><br>The decks of the Zeta Orbital are procedurally generated, and you can save your progress only when moving between them. Scavenge precious resources to explore each level, but never take your eye off your oxygen supply.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1185930/extras/867552b3fef49d28c29990d134f6917e.avif?t=1704998770\" width=620 height=184 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >An intricately-woven story</h2><br>The orbital’s crew didn’t disappear all at once — and left their own theories about what they saw happening around them scattered in their PDAs &amp; terminals.
