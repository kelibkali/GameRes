    "description": "A puzzle game about running, not because one has somewhere to be, but because one has somewhere they don't want to be.<br><br>In this game, you have to run away. Different doors are blocking the way, that need to be unlocked to proceed as fast as possible. Each door will give a different benefit, and a combination of them is the key to succeed .. or fail.<br><br>To open a door, a puzzle is presented, where pieces of a key have to be rotated and merged together to open the door. The further you run, the more difficult the key puzzles become.<br><br>There are three different modes:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Normal Mode: Score is increasing the more you survive. It decreases the more you stay idle in a room without picking a door. There's a set amount of rooms to complete before reaching the end.<br></li><li> Endless Mode: Score increases with each room that is completed. There is no end to the amount of rooms presented.<br></li><li> Random Mode: Each door has a specific score as a reward when opened. Rooms and their rewards spawn at random.</li></ul><br>The available benefits from the doors are:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Green doors: Increase running speed.<br></li><li> Purple doors: Increase lock-picking skills, which makes opening new doors easier.<br></li><li> Blue doors: Gives extra chances before losing.<br></li><li> Brown doors provide no direct benefit, apart from helping complete more rooms.</li></ul>",
