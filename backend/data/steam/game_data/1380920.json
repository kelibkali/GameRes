    "description": "From a simple home to a mighty kingdom; explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate your opponent in this strategic pixel-art chess-like hex game using cards as your pieces and their abilities as your tools. As the saying goes; easy to learn, hard to master. <br>                                                            <br>                                  <h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong><u>What to Expect</u></strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>[Local/Remote Play]</strong><br>- Demo ONLY has 1 v 1<br>- Up to 4 players in Early Access<br><br></li><li> <strong>Map Variety</strong><br>- Only 1 Map is available in the Demo.<br>- 4 Maps in Early Access, but More will be added over time.<br><br></li><li> <strong>Card Variety</strong><br>- Only a few of the cards are available in the Demo.<br>- A large assortment of cards that are used together to form even stronger cards. (EA)<br>- More being added over time to fulfill newer strategies and newer mechanics. (EA)<br><br></li><li> <strong>Different Modes</strong><br>- <strong>Basic:</strong> The basic form of the game, where players take turns.<br>- <strong>Timed:</strong> Similar to the basic mode, but players only have a set amount of time to complete their moves. (EA)<br>- <strong>Expert:</strong> A mode that brings the game closer to the RTS genre; where cards have cooldowns before use. (EA)<br>- Possibly more modes, or changes to the currently planned modes! (EA)<br><br></li><li> <strong>Endless Replayability.</strong><br>- Where the difficulty is based on your opponents' strategies.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><u><strong>Monetization Method [EARLY ACCESS]</strong></u></h2>This is only the Demo, BUT...<br><br>As the game progresses in development through Early Access, the price will rise; <u>online</u> being the major update that will more than likely double the game's price.<br><br>But until then, the game will be at its lower price-point, with possibly a middle ground between online and the first build; only when a significant amount of new features and cards have been added, or if sales take off. If the latter occurs though, I'll certainly add far more and do far more than I had initially planned for the beginning- particularly because if that happens, then I can focus completely on game development. And since this is an industry I love, I would happily focus on it.<br><br>But of course, these price changes and updates will all be announced and broadcasted for everyone to plan ahead to share with friends and whatnot.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong><u>Credits</u></strong></h2>Music Credits:  [All found on OpenGameArt[dot]Org]<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> First Song in Teaser and Battle Song by <strong>Matthew Pablo</strong><br><strong>Ireland's Coast (Travelog Edition - LIVE PLAYERS)</strong><br>matthewpablo[dot]com<br></li><li> End Song in Teaser, Menu Song, and Victory Song by <strong>Random Mind</strong><br><strong>Lament for a Warrior's Soul</strong><br><strong>Medieval: Battle</strong></li></ul><br>Sound Credits: [Various Sources]<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Various Sounds from <strong>Epic Stock Media</strong><br>epicstockmedia[dot]com</li></ul>",
