Could some of them even become the heroes' allies? And what is causing a series of strange visions and otherworldly invaders to haunt and harry the heroes?</i><br><i>This volume of Pathfinder Adventure Path continues the Return of the Runelords Adventure Path and includes:</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>&quot;Runeplague,&quot; a Pathfinder adventure for 8th-level characters, by Richard Pett.<br></li><li>Details on the vile faith and horrific cults of Yamasoth, the Polymorph Plague, by Jason Keeley.<br></li><li>An exploration of the legends and true natures of magic pools around Golarion, by Eleanor Ferron.<br></li><li>A bestiary of monsters, including the artistic yet alien ashullian, a disturbing manifestation of grim emotion known as the misery siktempora, and the eerily silent kasthezvi, by Mike Kimmel, Andrew Mullen, Richard Pett, and Jeffrey Swank.</li></ul><i>This product is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
