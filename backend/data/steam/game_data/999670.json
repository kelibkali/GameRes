The maps are sized to perfectly fit a 50 or 60px grid that you can manually place over the top of the map using Fantasy Grounds. Join the maps in this module together with each other, with other modules in this series, use a single map or use a combination of Time-lapse, Role-play and/or the supplied weighted Random Roll Table to determine when maps are used and where adventurers end up next.<br>DM Convenience is the focus with several ways to access, use and choose the maps in this module. Use the VISUAL MAP SELECTION PANEL and pick your map from the thumbnails and yellow label by clicking on the pin. Or use the RANDOM ROLL TABLE - a d100 table to pick your destination at random Or open Images/Maps tab to bring up a list of the maps labelled with a heading in [CAPITALS] and a brief description of each map so that you can quickly identify different files in this module, maps from this module and identify this module from others even if you have other FG meander modules open.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong></strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and any ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
