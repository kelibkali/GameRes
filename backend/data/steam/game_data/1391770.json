    "description": "You play a red Octopus, enjoying life in your very own inflatable pool. Unfortunately for you, Octopus invaders have infiltrated your peaceful serenity. To remove them, you can <strong>slam</strong> into the offending rascals, simply hold down the mouse on your player, aim, drag to build up power, then release the mouse to '<strong>slam</strong>' ! <strong>Only</strong> Octopodes of the same <strong>colour</strong> will disappear when they collide. The aim of the game is to reclaim your territory, clear all the enemies from your arena before the time runs out. Obstacles and environments change as you progress through the levels, watch out for scatter <strong>bombs</strong> and <strong>portals</strong>, sometimes they can help, other times they can be a hindrance. The game is a mouse controlled single player arcade experience, vibrant and easy to pick up and play, <strong>harder</strong> to master, flicking fun for all the family !",
