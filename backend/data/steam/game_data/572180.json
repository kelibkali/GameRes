The Zugs have escaped the detention zone!</strong><br><br><strong>Zap Zone</strong> is a <i>maze shooter</i> that borrows inspiration from classics like <i>Pac-Man</i>. Here you're put on the scene as <i>Zoey</i>, a space vigilant who finds herself in the middle of a rebellion started by <i>Zugs</i>, colorful alien monsters that are turning the space base upside down while trying to escape. Only you can restore order and lock them once and for all in their cells. But be careful! Zugs are not as dumb as they seem!<br><br>Carefully choose your path through the corridors. Danger lurks around every corner! Be prepared! To do this, arm yourself to the teeth with a variety of special weapons and learn how to use the environment in your favor. Technologies such as <i>Warp Gates</i> will be a great help during escape, allowing you to teleport back and forth instantly. Remember! This is a war field! Even if some of your enemies are pink...<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572180/extras/40334f17463facfc5604e85d04819bd6.webp?t=1572355696\" width=148 height=38 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>3 types of ammunition (Standard Energy, Bouncing Energy and Death Ray);<br></li><li>3 different zones;<br></li><li>Ground mines;<br></li><li>Explosive barrels;<br></li><li>Destructible crates;<br></li><li>Warp gates;<br></li><li>12 Steam trading cards;<br></li><li>26 Steam achievements;<br></li><li>Charismatic characters and vivid visuals.</li></ul><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572180/extras/c697eb1098f36a2d819304e9c81c1aad.avif?t=1572355696\" width=630 height=199 /></span>",
