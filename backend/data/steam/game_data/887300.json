However, everything changed the day that Ichiro showed up to settle old disputes accompanied by a powerful witch named Chiyo. Quickly, Akio and his best friend Kenzou were defeated. When Ichiro was about to kill Yori, the ninja Tsuru showed up and managed to escape with Yori and Kenzou. Unfortunately, it was already too late to save Akio. Knowing that Ichiro would not stop coming after Yori, Tsuru decided to take him far away, where he would be safe. <br>After 15 years have gone by, your adventure starts. Yori has finally come home to fulfill his duty of facing his father's killer. In order to be able to defeat him, Yori will need to improve his fighting skills and to rebuild the Takenaka House, allying himself to the people who once supported his father.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/887300/extras/0d8fcfaced9863131536e9e24a962656.avif?t=1571232367\" width=600 height=80 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>CLASSIC TURN-BASED BATTLES.</u> First all attacks are chosen; afterward, they are carried out in sequence.<br></li><li><u>3 TO 4 HOURS OF CAMPAIGN DIVIDED INTO 6 ACTS.</u> This linear game focuses on Yori’s story and how he and his allies improve in order to defeat Ichiro.<br></li><li><u>4 CHARACTERS WITH DISTINCT PLAYSTYLE.</u> Each character has their own characteristics and combat limitations. <br></li><li><u>CHOICES AFFECT CHARACTER PROGRESSION.</u> The player choices result in different abilities and attributes. <br></li><li><u>MULTIPLE ENDINGS.</u> There are 6 endings that reflect player's choices during the game.<br></li><li><u>NEW GAME+.</u> In this mode, most battles are removed from the game.
