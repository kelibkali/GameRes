What revelations still await, in these places even light doesn’t dare show?<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> In this first soundtrack, Virgil Marrel flies us beyond Obsolete’s cavernous walls, and shows us music has neither limit nor frontiers. </li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Close your eyes and fells let your mind be transported far from the ruins of this fallen world, at the edge of a universe where the songs of the stones surpass the test of time and degradation, and tell with a moving obscurity the story of a decomposed civilization. </li></ul>",
