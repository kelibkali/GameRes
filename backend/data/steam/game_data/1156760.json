Find Patches!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Game Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Familiar platforming and side-scrolling action.<br></li><li>Hand-drawn environments, characters, and animations.<br></li><li>Innovative parallel universe shifting mechanics.<br></li><li>Collectibles, puzzles, and hidden pathways.<br></li><li>Creative multi-layered level designs.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Parallel Universes</h2>Each universe has is its own space with unique themes, enemies, and attributes. A single level cannot be traversed by only interacting with one universe, so the relative spatial relationship of each universe is critical to gameplay. When Lily changes universes her momentum carries with her, allowing her to continue a jump from one universe to the next. This combination of parallaxing parallel universes, and momentum; creates a special blend of precision and puzzle platforming, that makes ParaLily both challenging and thoughtful.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1156760/extras/97be9c0807b8f84387e782c8aaba2b8a.avif?t=1762025856\" width=150 height=150 /></span>",
