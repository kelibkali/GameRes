    "description": "<strong>TRY KHEMIA'S DEMO!</strong><br><br>Khemia is a 2D puzzle-platformer with a technological medieval fantasy theme where you play Oti, a little kid who mysteriously has been turned into a goat. The game takes place inside the alchemist's tower, yes, the one who turned our little guy into a goat. You will have to jump, kick, dash and ram the enemies who will block your path!<br><br>While trying to go up the tower you will find difficulties, as the tower is alive and has the mision to hinder your way up. To avoid it, you will have to set up your own map! Slide, rotate or move the different rooms you find inside the cauldron to get to the orbs. Once you obtain an orb, move around the rooms again to get to the door to the next level.<br><br>If an enchanted tower and heavy horns weren't enough, you will have to run for your life while escaping from an evil shadow. Who is that shadow? Will you be able to reach the end with an enemy that will chase you to the end of the world?<br><br><strong>GAME FEATURES</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>2D Puzzle-platformer with a technological medieval fantasy theme.<br></li><li>The cutest protagonist you have ever seen. <br></li><li>A not-so-evil antagonist and a shadow who creeps around.<br></li><li>Great soundtrack. </li></ul>",
