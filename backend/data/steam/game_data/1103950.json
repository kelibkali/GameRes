    "description": "ANAREA Battle Royale is the first project of AXC Games indie studio. ANAREA is a fast-paced Third Person Shooter Battle Royale arcady game aiming to be dynamic and competitive. The game will be composed of a training mode and several game modes, such as solo, duos and squads.

No doubt that it’ll be necessary to show accuracy and combat mechanics to reach the royal victory.",
