As a guide, your job is to help tour groups survive Heroland's monsters and mazes. Customize your guests' strategies, repair their weapons, and keep them healed. When the going gets tough, buy comics to buff your team's stats or summon a monster from a capsule to do the fighting for you. And once it's Treasure Time, skim a little loot off the top to add some personal flair to Lucky's dorm room!<br><br><strong>Diverse Parties of Unique Heroes</strong><br><br>When the Prince of Knowble is just another tourist and the Dark Lord’s minions are your coworkers, it’s hard to draw the line between work and play! Nobuyuki Inoue has written a tale of over 20 quirky characters to recruit, including upright knights, phantom thieves, high school girls, and a casually nihilistic otter—or is he human? No one knows for sure, but they're all here at Heroland!<br><br><strong>A Monstrously Colorful Cast</strong><br><br>While your customers hack and slash their way through the MonStar Team's palette-swapped trash mobs and towering bosses, the MonDex will fill itself with pro tips, amusing anecdotes, and inane trivia about the coworkers whose butts you've kicked: jungle-dwelling goblins, cute li'l slugs, selfie-loving skeletons, and...magical Romanesco broccoli?!<br><br><strong>Retro Graphics Reimagined</strong><br><br>Like any theme park, Heroland's success hinges on the lovability (and marketability) of its mascots. That's why Nobuhiro Imagawa has revamped his old-school style for the 21st century by taking 2D sprites and transforming them alchemy-like into 3D models that bend, stretch, and squish their way through the third dimension. You've got to see it in action to believe it--and once you do, it can never be unseen!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1066030/extras/e36e976b1725aecb90f4a81d3ed90c87.poster.avif?t=1751393946\" width=600 height=298 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1066030/extras/e36e976b1725aecb90f4a81d3ed90c87.webm?t=1751393946\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1066030/extras/e36e976b1725aecb90f4a81d3ed90c87.mp4?t=1751393946\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
