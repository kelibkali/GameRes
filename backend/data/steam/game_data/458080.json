    "description": "<strong>After a disastrous docking, you must explore the abandoned ICARUS.1 space station looting and slowly discovering whats happened to the crew and a way of escape.</strong> This demo contains the first chapter and is a short slice of whats to come. It's been released to gather feedback and help with testing. Because it's just a demo not all features may be included and subject to change.<br><br><i>Abandoned for decades, crew MIA, the ICARUS.1's job was to store mined minerals from the systems outlying planets. It orbits the local sun to maintain it's solar energy and proved a lucrative business for JME corp.<br><br>After contact was lost no attempt was ever made to make contact with the stricken station, instead the project was mothballed - a cover up some may say. Many stories about what happened have become lore but Sam isn't focusing on these 'stories', the goal is the cargo and the wealth it will bring.</i>",
