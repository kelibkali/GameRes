Andy Kosakovsky, the composer I am lucky to work with, has created a true masterpiece, which resonates perfectly with every event of the game as well as a human soul.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you're interested in genuine musical art, that's the OST you're looking for!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe DLC includes remastered version of each track + 2 bonus tracks.",
