There's also a chance for a weapon attachments that will aid in defense.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1332670/extras/dc98a4ebae107882e8867ecfbaa6b387.avif?t=1617783902\" width=614 height=240 /></span><br><br>Don’t forget you have help above.

Some explode, others heal, jump, or buff their allies. <br><br>• R7 - basic fodder.  Higher tiers can be more dangerous close up<br>• R10 - a somewhat tanky bot that closes the distance fast with a jump-jet ability<br>• Electrobot - small battery bot that can buff allied bots and stun Buddies<br>• Squidbots - these come in different sizes, smaller ones are annoying and fast, biggest can split after death and have stronger weapons<br>• Spiderbots - just like Squidbots, they vary in size.  The bigger they get, the badder they are.<br>• Washer - a big, durable bot that carries a huge explosive, don't let him near the Core!<br>• Cat - invisible, quick + a powerful siege gun<br>• Fixfly - this one doesn't hurt you, but its very annoying.<br>• Wormbot - heavy Whack-A-Mole unit",
