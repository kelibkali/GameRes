    "description": "Mass Plus tasks players with using physics driven, self replicating, projectiles to complete levels by destroying target spheres.  Each level can be completed quickly but achieving high scores will require a more steady approach. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nProjectile spheres will spawn - and consume - smaller versions of themselves, increasing their size until they reach a critical mass. As a sphere grows, its pull on neighbors does as well. Players will have to carefully consider the merits of growing a sphere and risking its annihilation versus completing levels more quickly for a lesser score.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Mass Plus, a player's score is determined by precision, planning, and a little luck. Will you race to complete each level or strive to be the top of a global leader board?",
