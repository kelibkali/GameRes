    "description": "Entanglement is a contemplative, non-game, <strong>Virtual Reality artwork</strong> that aims to sweep the viewer through a <strong>360° view of four different audiovisual sequences.</strong> <strong>Generative computer graphics</strong> and <strong>3D binaural audio </strong>craft a radiant and relaxing ride as you sway in the middle of orbiting particles and sophisticated light-play.<br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >WHAT IS ENTANGLEMENT?</h2></strong>When two or more non-interacting particles link up in a certain way, no matter how far apart they are in space, and their states remain linked. They now share a common, unified state. It is an <strong>uncanny phenomenon in quantum physics</strong>, one that defies explanations. <br>Einstein didn’t believe in it. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2101650/extras/b76fd91454b3d50f9aff7de8d77cf4cf.poster.avif?t=1664800774\" width=640 height=360 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2101650/extras/b76fd91454b3d50f9aff7de8d77cf4cf.webm?t=1664800774\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2101650/extras/b76fd91454b3d50f9aff7de8d77cf4cf.mp4?t=1664800774\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>This piece blends <strong>scientific research and artistic performance. </strong>Adapted from a live audio-visual festival show, Entanglement oscillates between four theories: the fluidity of time, the multiverse, the Copenhagen interpretation and decoherence.
