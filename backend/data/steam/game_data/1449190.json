    "description": "Explore the high seas in search of fame, fortune and exciting adventures! SEAFARER is a game set in the age of sailships. You play as a young captain commanding a merchant ship staffed with a small but loyal crew of seamen. You and your men can travel the oceans and visit harbour towns to trade goods, carry out assignments, and gather information from the local populace. Defend yourself against pirates, and engage in combat in case of provocation. The ocean is populated by many strange and exotic creatures -- some friendly, some not so friendly. Study their behaviors and learn to interact with them to your benefit. Keep an eye on the wind and weather, look out for tides and currents, avoid reefs and shallows in order to guide your ship and crew safely through the waters. Navigating your ship requires some skill, as you need to take the wind into account and tack/jibe accordingly. As you progress in the game, you can equip your ship with better weapons, sails and shielding. Should your funds allow it, you can also upgrade to a bigger ship with a larger cargo hold, allowing you to transport more goods and boost your trade. Fair winds, and may the ocean gods be with you!<br><br>Funded by nordmedia – Film- und Mediengesellschaft Niedersachsen/Bremen mbH<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449190/extras/1eadc5a4708040862f2125a9254dbf2b.avif?t=1754637159\" width=290 height=124 /></span>",
