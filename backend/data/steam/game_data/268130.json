We'd always rather have a happy non-customer than an unhappy customer. So here's what it isn't:<br><br>-<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>It's not story-driven: there's a backstory to this place and a few conversations with characters, but there's not a story that develops as you play. It's much more about the stories you generate by playing, about how you got out of impossible situation X or pulled off crazy stunt Y.<br><br></li><li>There aren't other careers: You can't mine asteroids. You can't build ships. You can't recruit a crew. You're an infiltrator, you break into spaceships for a living, it's all about that.<br><br></li><li>There are no planets: The whole game takes place in this nebula full of space stations. You can dock at any friendly station and board any hostile ship, but it's not a space exploration game.<br><br></li><li>It's not multiplayer: The friends features mentioned above are fun but they're just sharing content, it's not multiplayer at all and you're never in the same world together.</li></ul><br>There are cool games about all those things. This is a cool game about something else!",
