    "description": "Welcome to Rune Break, the completely free time survival game with minimalistic gameplay and rogue-lite elements. As a solo developer, my goal was to create a game that everyone could enjoy without any barriers. That's why Rune Break is completely free to download and play, and there is no monetization whatsoever.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Rune Break, your objective is simple - survive as long as possible and gather as many gems as you can to power up your next character. With over 20 skills and abilities, you must experiment with different builds to upgrade your abilities and go even further on your next run. Face off against challenging bosses, unlock achievements, and use various points of interest to your advantage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut beware, the game is not easy, and you cannot hide. You must survive, or you will lose everything. However, with every failure, comes new opportunities to learn and try again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRune Break V1.0 is finally here, featuring new bosses, new maps, new enemies, and many more surprises in store for you. Plus, with controller support, you can play the game with your favorite controller for a more immersive experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhether you prefer fast-paced action or strategic gameplay, Rune Break has something for you. With its minimalistic design and rogue-lite elements, the game offers endless replayability, challenging gameplay, and satisfying progression. You can unlock new skills and abilities, upgrade your character, and even experiment with different builds to discover the perfect combination for you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the game has been thoroughly tested, there may still be a few issues or bugs that need to be resolved. I am committed to resolving any problems that arise to ensure that the game is as polished and enjoyable as possible. Your feedback is always welcome, and I invite you to join our Discord group to connect with other players and share your experiences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDownload Rune Break now for a completely free gaming experience that's all about survival, strategy, and skill.",
