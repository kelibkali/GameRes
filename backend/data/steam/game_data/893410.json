With money fast running out, the search for somewhere affordable becomes ever more desperate, until one day you receive an offer to look over a &quot;modest room&quot;, residing in a &quot;humble mansion&quot;, in an out-of-the way location.  Will you accept the invitation to see what the room is, or will you just wait and hope for something better ?<br><br><strong>DETAILS</strong><br><br>The Mansion is an interactive (non-visual) short novel and is the prologue to the main set of stories, each of which will follow your interactions with different residents at the residence. <br><br>- Demo version is the complete prologue version, minus secret scenes which expand the story based on the viewpoint of other characters<br>- Choices affect the ending and may cut short your life!<br><br>Music by Kevin MacLeod  Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0<br>and &quot;TWINKLEBELL&quot; by Josh Woodward Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution",
