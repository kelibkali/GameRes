Many projects have come and gone over the years but Child Arms is the most ambitious project yet. With the concept conceived in 2004, formed in 2014, and finally beginning production in 2019, this game aims to put everything that I have learned from the past 2 decades.<br><br>But the ambition for this game goes beyond just this title alone. The scope of this game alone is so large that I had to split it into 3 parts, with this game being the first. With a studio doing art and a composer on board, we are a small team trying to make an amazing game, but we can't do it without the support of a community. That is why I am working hard to make Child Arms the best game it can be and become more than just an indie game, but something far greater.<br><br>Your support is highly appreciated in this early stage of development.",
