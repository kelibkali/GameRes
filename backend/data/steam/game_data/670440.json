    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Game</h2>Dreams. What are dreams actually? Do we really know? <br>Let me tell you of an orphan boy, barely remembering his own mother and father. A subject of bullying since young age and living in a dirty, old orphanage. <br>That was his prison. This is where he tried the unthinkable twice, just to escape from it.<br>Until one cold night in November he dreamed it. He dreamed a green meadow, covered in flowers on a sunny day. The birds were singing, there was a sound of running water nearby and a gentle, female voice was calling him from a white, wooden house. &quot;It could not be her&quot;, he says to himself while dreaming. But it was her. His mother was standing on the doorstep, looking for him. <br>From that moment, he started coming to that house every night hoping that he will speak with his parents and that maybe, he will find out why they left him when he was still a baby. At least that was what he was thinking in the morning, remembering this colorful magic dream, that he had the night before. <br>That was his escape. There he was free.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > Inspiration</h2>I have always loved the presentation and the beauty of a games such as &quot;Journey&quot;, &quot;Abzu&quot; and &quot;The Witness&quot;. These games made me think about the most games on the market these days with all the gore, fast-paced action, and I decided to create something different. I hope that, with your help, &quot;Obscure&quot; will become the beautiful, relaxing adventure that I want it to be.<br>I have to say that my inspiration does not only come from games. In &quot;Obscure&quot; you will find a lot of subjects that come from different books, ancient texts, interesting theories and more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Contact</h2>I would like to get as much feedback as I can in order to make &quot;Obscure&quot; better, so if you have any ideas, critique or you just want to get some more information for yourself, don't hesitate to contact me on the e-mail I provided.<br><br>Thank you! I wish you all a kickass day!",
