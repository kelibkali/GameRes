    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Oh, when will they learn?</h2><br>It’s a regular white-knuckling, heart-palpitating, pulse-pounding, fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants action adventure in Ray &amp; Stoic Gronk. Our titular heroes will have to run, jump, stab and steal their way to stop the misunderstood, magical, misfit Malice and her legions of followers from unleashing a benevolent deity that threatens all of existence… Oh, when will they learn?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Cooler Heads must Prevail!</h2><br>The open wilds of Marathon are taxing. You’ll need to <strong>run, jump, climb, crouch, roll and run some more</strong> as you platform your way to the Capital.<br><br>Discover recipes to <strong>craft useful items</strong> like throwable gems, a grappling hook, but with gems for the hook and explosives… also filled with so many gems!<br><br>Also <strong>starring a motley crew of enemies</strong> - some are allergic to sword slashes, others can’t stand fire and some just want to play a spirited game of volleyball, but the volleyball is a shiny, fragile vial full of highly explosive liquid.<br><br><strong>Hardcoore parkour</strong> in the shiny metal mech known as Mark V. Warbot on his way to face off in a one-on-one, mano-a-mano, no holds barred fight to the death against other larger-than-life robots who are also armed for combat <br><br>Explore as many have come before with a bird's eye view - <strong>where do you go? That’s up to you.</strong> From the sandy beaches and verdant hills to snow-capped mountains that bring on the chills.<br><br>Each province in Marathon is <strong>home to a bevy of eclectic folk.</strong> Some are lonely, oh so lonely, and just want to talk. Others like to share gossip, even if you didn’t ask for it. And best of all, some may even provide services, what kind? Enjoy finding out!",
