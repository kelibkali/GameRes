Will you flap your wings to soar through the sky and shoot fireballs as <strong>Draco</strong>? Or, zoom through the sky with the hand thrusters as <strong>Jet-9</strong>?  Or &quot;Blink&quot; Teleport around the sky and summon black Hole with Lady V's Gravity Gun? As we develop the game further during Early Access, we look forward to YOUR feedback and suggestions as we add more Heroes, each with unique flying and battle capabilities.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/625830/extras/0b056d19cfb34cf13cc98a3a2dddcd84.avif?t=1528212572\" width=608 height=2132 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/625830/extras/09adfb727d069ae0ab3d1e0765ce7c8c.avif?t=1528212572\" width=608 height=1740 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/625830/extras/157bab82399cccb70a57e4ea2bb71d67.avif?t=1528212572\" width=608 height=1464 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Single Player Mission Mode</h2>Each Hero will have a single player mission mode where you'll learn the back story about the Heroes, and get familiar with the controls and the unique Flying Locomotion.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Co-op missions</h2>We are adding new co-op missions that allow 1-4 players to team up against A.I.  Our first Co-op mission is Co-op escort.  Players team up to escort an airship to the destination while fighting off A.I.  We will be adding more co-op modes as we develop the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Unique VR Locomotion</h2>The game’s unique hyper-speed flying locomotion mechanisms had been tested by over 1300 testers, and has been fine-tuned to allow nausea-free extreme high speed flying (imagine flying at 200 km/h).  Less than 5% of our testers and players have experienced motion sickness with our locomotion systems. With 3 heroes currently, and 1 more planned for the game by the time we exit Early Access, players will be sure to find a hero that matches their play style.  Depending on the community's response, we will look to add more Heroes based on the community's input.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Early Access</h2>We want to engage the gaming community during Early Access and continue to add more Heroes, Maps, and Gameplay Modes as we develop the game continuously.  We look forward to your feedback and help us shape this unique VR game. Please see the &quot;Early Access&quot; section for what content will be available at launch of Early Access.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Our Ultimate Goal</h2>Our goal is to create a <strong>Multiplayer VR FPS game</strong> that will define a new generation of e-Sport.  We hope to co-create with YOU a game that has depth, encourages strategic gameplay, and is just awesome and unlike any other experiences on VR.  Please see the &quot;Early Access&quot; section for what content we plan to complete by the time we exit Early Access.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >VR</h2>This game requires a VR system.  The game will initially only support HTC Vive when we start Early Access.  The game works with Oculus, we have implemented a swipe-to-turn feature to rotate the view.  WMR: playable but may lose hand tracking when certain hand motions go beyond the field of view.",
