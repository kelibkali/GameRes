    "description": "<strong>Overworld</strong> - Map Keeper’s Realm is world building software that focuses on large scale world creation and procedural generates lower levels that can be fine-tuned hex by hex. With it, you can quickly and easily sculpt your world, retain its history, and share it with others.  Overworld’s propagating levels enables you to create and detail your whole world with a single map. Other features like searchable points of interest and labels breathe life into your world.

Take detailed notes about locations, player characters, parties, events, or items. POIs feature a tagging system that is searchable. Simply assign appropriate tags (such as the overarching kingdom, important rulers, characters, etc.) and search them when needed. Clicking on a searched POI jumps the camera to the POI's location. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1513490/extras/da31157490cf9ba645983693a45a7b76.avif?t=1714625276\" width=616 height=100 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1513490/extras/44b1816ce0fa4d02b65f3d7b95ff74be.poster.avif?t=1714625276\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1513490/extras/44b1816ce0fa4d02b65f3d7b95ff74be.webm?t=1714625276\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1513490/extras/44b1816ce0fa4d02b65f3d7b95ff74be.mp4?t=1714625276\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Scaling levels are a core component of Overworld - Map Keeper's Realm. There are three main levels: World, Continent, and Region. Landmass created at the world level uses procedural generation to create a hex map at the continent level. The continent level generates the region level. Changes to each level propagate both down and up. POIs propagate across the continent and region level, too!",
