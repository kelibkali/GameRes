    "description": "Reflect Horizons is a VR immersive art installation that explores the idea of reality within a virtual world. It borrows from familiar real-world installations, that abstract and manipulate reality, to see what happens when what's being abstracted is not actually real.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis 10-minute experience takes you on a journey from dawn to dusk, from water to sky, from virtual to reality and back again. Starting on a platform at the base of the virtual dome, you will rise through the vast void, surrounded by an ever-changing performance of realities.<br />\r\nNo controllers, no interactions, no phone, no Instagram. Allow yourself to escape your reality and be completely immersed in another.",
