    "description": "<strong>Never stop the race. Not even after the world is over.</strong><br><br>Postapo Mechanic Simulator gives you a glimpse into the grim future. Humanity can only survive at the top of ruined skyscrapers and makeshift platforms, where they compete in dangerous races. It's your job to keep their cars running and to make sure they can actually reach the finish line.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1529260/extras/dc6a0fb6218c168a15e08a090b0ae563.poster.avif?t=1725012930\" width=620 height=349 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1529260/extras/dc6a0fb6218c168a15e08a090b0ae563.webm?t=1725012930\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>Cars are hard to come by and parts are sparse. Make sure to carefully check every part of a vehicle and fix everything you can. When faced with no alternative - barter for a wrecked car and scavenge for the right components. Just make sure that the cars you fixed don't fall apart before the end of the race. Your clients are not the forgiving sort.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1529260/extras/8cc620d4cb351d955653141f76b4121a.poster.avif?t=1725012930\" width=620 height=349 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1529260/extras/8cc620d4cb351d955653141f76b4121a.webm?t=1725012930\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>You can't always get your hands on what you need to finish a job. After the end of the world, there are no shops where you can buy shiny new replacement parts. Instead, you have to collect scrap and assemble it into something useful. It doesn't need to be the most practical. Make it work, make it look edgy, and folks will fight to get their hands on cars fixed with your handmade parts.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1529260/extras/437b3ef6fecf999aa7fc74bce7c7a8d3.poster.avif?t=1725012930\" width=620 height=349 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1529260/extras/437b3ef6fecf999aa7fc74bce7c7a8d3.webm?t=1725012930\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>Measure your success not only in the scrap you collect but also in the street cred you gain. A good mechanic is worth their weight in gold and your clients will soon start recognizing your name. Earn their gratitude and gain access to rare parts you otherwise couldn't get. In these trying times, favors are often more valuable than cash.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Many crazy cars to work on<br></li><li>A unique post-apocalyptic setting, where you work high above the ground and the polluted air that's covering it<br></li><li>Hand-made parts that change the cars' statistics<br></li><li>Various tools to use when repairing damaged vehicles<br></li><li>Breathtaking scenery of the world suspended between ruined skyscrapers<br></li><li>Randomized assignments to complete<br></li><li>Decorative elements that can turn your vehicles into truly menacing machines<br></li><li>Unlimited fun!</li></ul>",
