The objective on the <strong><i><u>Campaign mode</u></i></strong> is to make your way along the map overcoming the <strong><i>challenges</i></strong> on each level, unlocking new islands and bonus levels, and fighting battles against final bosses.&quot; The <strong><i><u>Survival mode</u></i></strong> is a potentially <strong><i>infinite game</i></strong> level with an unlimited number of creatures, where the most important thing is strategic freedom when it comes to facing the hordes of mutant enemies.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/495090/extras/d4e9b9a9e086cf1974f62f985c7c0326.avif?t=1469118999\" width=625 height=165 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A fun, casual strategic adventure puzzle experience for all ages:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong><i>Pure fun for everyone</i></strong>.
