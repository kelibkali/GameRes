    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story</h2><strong>You were abducted by the original crew of this ship.</strong> With a bit of help from an unexpected ally, you were able to take control of the situation. Now that crew has been reduced to their basic elements, sorted and stored in the hold to use for future repairs.<br><br><strong>Escape required some sacrifices.</strong> Your consciousness converted to an infinitesimal point, you now have the appearance of a luminous orb. You've also made enemies of some of the most powerful beings known anywhere. In order to survive, you've retreated to the fringes of the multiverse. Everything here is foreign and sparse in comparison to what you knew. Your ally assures you it's the safest place to begin recovery.<br><br><strong>Your abductors thought of you as an animal.</strong> They didn't believe you could comprehend their communications, but you picked up enough to figure out that they were amused by your genetic similarity to a chimp, and that they anticipated using you in some very cruel experiments.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/848400/extras/2f692738de5a7b1193c96324efea7427.avif?t=1529180218\" width=600 height=124 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >They picked a fight with the wrong simian.</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Current Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Take control of a ship with capabilities almost beyond imagination.
