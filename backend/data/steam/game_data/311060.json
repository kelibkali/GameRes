Little by little, life returned back to normal.<br><br>The story begins, when a young neophyte journeys north, to learn from an eccentric wizard, one of the most ancient and powerful Guild’s members. The apprentice doesn’t know yet, that his teacher-to-be is one of the Keepers, and that his destiny is to become a catalyst for the events, that will make Daenmor shudder…<br><br>Battle Mages: Sign of Darkness is an enthralling journey to the world of original game. It offers four new campaigns, covering dramatic events that took place in Daenmor long before the Shadow of Warlock spread over the land. The player will discover the mysteries of the Order of the Keepers, confront treacherous plans of the elves, lead vengeful Orcs to the battle, oppose the creatures of Chaos, and of course the darkness will raise its flag over the green hills of Daenmor under his command.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/311060/extras/Features.png?t=1691585823\" /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Four new campaigns explaining the conflict between the nations<br></li><li>A number of single-player maps <br></li><li>A unique hero with specific traits for each campaign <br></li><li>New magic abilities – additional Dark Magic school <br></li><li>New units, upgrades, and the addition of two new races -  Dwarves and the Undead <br></li><li>Hero leads his troops through the entire campaign <br></li><li>Improved inventory system, including trade interface, new artifacts and items <br></li><li>New tactic possibilities in troop control <br></li><li>Day and night conditions, weather simulation<br></li><li></li></ul>",
