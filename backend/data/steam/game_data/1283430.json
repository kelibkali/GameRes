To make up for it he can stand on his hind legs and move around more freely at the cost of being hard to control.<br><br><strong>Nicolas</strong><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1283430/extras/81d75385a8e28ab2c51ea5b4c8f91934.avif?t=1636722877\" width=114 height=128 /></span><br><i>Not too long ago Leons little brother Nic fused with a demon named Olas, together they have been terrorizing the land ever since...</i><br>Nicolas is a powerful but somewhat slow setup character.
