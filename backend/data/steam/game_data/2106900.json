Then, they can be enchanted with a currency by Lesser Runes (adding more damage) or upgraded by an upgrade scheme and Great Runes (changing the effect). The quick slot allows assigning 3 spells at a time but gives an option to quickly swap to another spell set. Mathematically, considering the combination of Lesser Runes, Great Runes, and Upgrades, there are as many as <strong>7776 spells variants</strong>. As you progress, the spells can be disassembled in order to use the aspects components for another assembly. <br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2106900/extras/ce46cb7cbd6dc0badbd1fc510e2921cf.webp?t=1769780539\" width=560 height=40 /></span><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2106900/extras/29fbdfb134869de65f2bcdc4ba053ce2.poster.avif?t=1769780539\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2106900/extras/29fbdfb134869de65f2bcdc4ba053ce2.webm?t=1769780539\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2106900/extras/29fbdfb134869de65f2bcdc4ba053ce2.mp4?t=1769780539\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>On your exploration journey, you will <strong>fight many small creatures</strong> formed from their locations such as Slimes, Mosquitoes, but also bigger creepy beasts like Rats or Spitting Plants. The main fights though, will not only require a neat set of spells and skills but most importantly the decisions to take based on your will. As RIN, the sixth child of the Creator, you will<strong> confront five bosses</strong> - your unknown siblings. <br><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2106900/extras/ce85b8eab298222503e60883a7ab3a18.avif?t=1769780539\" width=560 height=100 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2106900/extras/82c17544c83b711e101b75c00c3b5f04.webp?t=1769780539\" width=560 height=40 /></span><br><br><br>The story of RIN, her siblings, and their Creator, the Teller of Tales, was inspired by the well-known ancient myth about Cronus and his conflict with his children. It also touches upon the overall passing of gods who must be replaced by new gods. <strong>The creation myths</strong> seemed to match perfectly Metroidvania's dark fairy tale - no trace of man, but the importance of magic. An important motif and another layer of the script is the conflict between being obedient to authority - the father (the Creator) or freedom - the free will and responsibility for oneself and one's decisions. There are three possible endings to the story based on the choices you’ll make.",
