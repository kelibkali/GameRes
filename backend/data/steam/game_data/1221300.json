Tire Friend's game is mostly 3D platformer, with some 2.5D action and brain puzzles sprinkled in for good measure. <br><br><strong>Note:</strong> Tire Friend is still under construction, and it won't be complete without <strong>your</strong> feedback.

Now jump off that cliff. Now bounce right back up. Now rev up, hit the ground, burst forth into Overdrive! ... and then crash right through traffic barrels and soar past perilous pits and pokey things. That's how you chain together a series of moves and channel your momentum!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Exploring a variety of stages!</h2>Levels are still in the works, but there's a good variety here. Desert temples, asphalt hills, junk scattered around space, perilous volcanoes—Tire Friend Planet's got it all!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Collecting powerups galore!</h2>The creator has snuck several different powerups into his obstacle courses for Tire Friend to find: magnets, wings, Arc-rated tire covers, and more. If you've hit a rough spot, you can equip multiple powerups at the same time to give yourself a leg up on Tire Friend Planet's clever machinations. If you're past a rough spot, you can store them for later!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Driving the direction of the game!</h2>I'd love to hear your thoughts in the discussion forum. What do you like? What do you hate? What can be done better? Let me know—and, together, we can help Kevin appease his family by making Tire Friend Planet the best that it can be!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >THE STORY SO FAR...</h2>Tire Friend's story begins with Kevin, the underachieving older brother of Gaea. One day, Gaea crafted a wholly intricate universe and populated it with things like human beings, rocks, trees, and stars. After creating the laws of physics, she set her Rube Goldberg machine in motion. Kevin will never forget how loudly and enthusiastically the whole family cheered for her. Ever since then, she has been showered with admiration, attention, and praise—and he has been left sulking in her shadow. In fits and spurts over the eons, he has tried in secrecy—and in vain—to replicate her success.<br><br>But Kevin is determined to gain his family's respect once and for all, and his latest attempt may do the trick. He has cobbled together his own universe in his dad's garage using any bits of scrap, junk, and trash that he could get his hands on. The centerpiece of this universe is Tire Friend Planet, the home planet of—and lush playground for—Tire Friend. Kevin has breathed life into Tire Friend with the express purpose of conquering a series of obstacle courses that he has sprinkled all over Tire Friend Planet. Tire Friend will accomplish his mission by bouncing, rolling, and speeding all around Tire Friend Planet, crossing Finish Lines and collecting Golden Hubcaps along the way. And through Tire Friend's world tour, Kevin will hopefully be able to prove to the rest of the pantheon that he is also capable of creating good and interesting things—just like his sister.",
