    "description": "<strong>Mushroom: The Ruckus is a 2D top-down hack-n-slash type deal where you play as a mushroom with a vendetta against his kind. </strong><br><br>You are a social pariah, cast away from the &quot;cool&quot; groups due to a series of non-descript events. You find affirmation in a mysterious floating eyeball who seems to enjoy watching you whack other mushrooms. <br><br>That's where you come in- play through ten levels of hacking and another ten levels of slashing for a combined total of <strong>20 levels</strong> of hack-n-slash combat against several different enemy types. <br><br><br>...<br><br>Maybe once you've destroyed all these other mushrooms, you'll feel better?<br><br>Good luck!",
