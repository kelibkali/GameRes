    "description": "In this alternate universe the elevator has crashed below the 1000th room revealing even more terrific monstrosities. In this new abyss lies Karamari Hospital, long abandoned by the living and infested with the not so living. Can you tackle this new marvelous pit of despair and suffering, or will you end up like most of the patients of Karamari Hospital with your various organs removed and placed into bins that sorted both alphabetically and by buoyancy? Only you have the power to start forest fires with your mind and find the ending of this game. (Note: You do not have pyrokinesis in this game, sorry)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDoes not require the base game to play, pay to no attention to the banners that say that, I can't remove them :l",
