Explore the vast world, vanquish enemies to gain new abilities, and uncover the secrets within.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInspired by Metroid and Megaman, this game features unlockable abilities which you will need to master to explore new areas. As your skill increases, the game will continue to challenge you with smarter, stronger enemies, and punishing level design. Expect to die, and try again.",
