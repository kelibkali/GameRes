You'll need to wall jump, and slash your way through 6 stages of challenging narrow saw blade corridors, security droids and lasers while grabbing as much scrap as you can.<br><br>Gameplay is simple but hard to master. You can Jump and attack (if you can find the hidden Kaizo blade). <br>Collect hidden and hard to reach scrap to get %100 completion. <br><br>Ikeda: The Scrap Hunter is a challenging stage based game with no micro transactions or loot box shenanigans.<br><br>Approximate time time to complete is 45 minutes if you're a pro at these sorts of games. But to get 100% of collectibles may take up to 5-6 hours.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1052380/extras/1d7341fe1a6469da4c6f8174d926f7cd.avif?t=1753217870\" width=164 height=314 /></span>",
