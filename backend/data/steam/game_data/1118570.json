    "description": "Erstwhile Tower is a quick-paced, tactically inspired game where everything acts based on the tempo of a clock.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTime is off tempo and you control the 3 Archons tasked with restoring time to its natural rhythm by refueling the Erstwhile Tower. Use their respective powers to protect the Chronoxin fuel from hazards, traps and enemies found in the grid-based isometric levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClimb the 13 levels by solving hardcore puzzles while thinking fast. Make sure the payload reaches the end of its track, and be ready to protect it with your life. Literally.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUse the mage’s Teleportation and Stasis, the scout’s enhanced speed and defusing skill, as well as the soldier’s sword and shield to make sure nothing gets in your way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEncounter a variety of deadly automates and complex traps that will put your brain to the test.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut more importantly : don’t lose track of Time, or else, the tower will move without you!",
