Don’t panic! As a battle-seasoned smuggler, you’ll clear the way through all the obstacles to your airship.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/531240/extras/467b2e55ce304f607b51b562bd94e909.avif?t=1478025020\" width=620 height=100 /></span></h2><br><i>One day, as Max, a former officer of Her Vaporous Majesty, transported contraband cargo of ammunition, his airship was knocked out over a mysterious tropical island. The force of impact threw Max out of the airship, while it kept moving on automatic pilot and finally fell to the ground at the other end of the island. <br>When Max came to himself in the jungle, he decided to move through the thicket to find his airship or at least its debris. At that moment he didn’t even imagine the hell, he would go through…<br>Find out the destiny of Spanish colonists and native Indians, who became a part of a monstrous story. Help Max to bring together all the pieces of this exiting and complicated chronicle and attempt to solve riddles no human is supposed to know. Try to save your life and unintentionally become a witness of some horrific events, which took place many centuries ago.</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/531240/extras/517b7c0ddb1f9147f43213eeea9e17f9.avif?t=1478025020\" width=620 height=100 /></span></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tAn island full of dangers, traps and ruthless enemies  <br></li><li>\tYou’ll have various guns to grind your vicious foes into dust<br></li><li>\tIf at any point your guns seem insufficient, use mines with no doubt <br></li><li>\tAlthough not very smart, the skeletons are not an easy mark at all.
