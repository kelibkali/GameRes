    "description": "You take control of the lonely Nanobyte, NF01, who has been released within the Skystar System grid after a cascade of failures due to a serious shock causing the systems fuses to explode. Your mission is to fix all the broken fuses by using three different abilities and return the power back to the Skystar System.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFused is a first-person science fiction platformer puzzle game, that is set inside a computer system which is styled in the classic 1980s sci-fi cyber world with a modern twist. Made within Unreal 4 engine, Fused is a linear pathed, interactive game that contains puzzle elements which helps you reactivate the levels to progress further. By picking up fragmented files, you are able to piece together who is behind the attack and what the systems main function is all about.",
