    "description": "<p>Coil is an experimental \"autobiographical\" game that plays out more like a song or painting then an actual \"game\". I was basically trying to create an experience that put the player into an open minded space and let them question not only what the game was about, but what a game can actually be.</p>                    \n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Coil uses mouse movements only, no keys or clicking is involved at all.</p>",
