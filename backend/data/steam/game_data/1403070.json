    "description": "The official soundtrack to <i>A Monster's Expedition (Through Puzzling Exhibitions)</i> is composed and produced by <strong>Eli Rainsberry</strong>, with album art by <strong>Adam deGrandis</strong>.<br><br>The soundtrack is an eclectic mix of guitar and piano-led instrumentation, with roots and inspiration in ambient and jazz, and some classical elements. The soundtrack begins with establishing guitar notes that swells to a full band ensemble, before settling down to its ambient state.<br><br>A handful of the tracks from the soundtrack are real-time arrangements from each set of themes as progress unfolds. Each dynamic palette is inspired by the preceding theme as you get to certain points in the game. Jazz interludes play as you take time to sit by the ocean, or during other states of resting intervals.",
