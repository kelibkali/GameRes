    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Ashes of Kardoria is a dark, choice-driven RPG where moral decisions shape your path. This isn’t a story about being a hero — there are no “good” answers, only consequences. As plague spreads and supplies run thin, tensions build toward a faction war, and the Orc threat grows stronger by the day.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You’ll eventually be forced to choose a side: the Guards or the Hunters. Your faction choice gives you a distinct path of progression, training, and access to gear — pulling you deeper into a conflict that can’t be avoided.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >  <br>Build your character around multiple combat paths: one-handed weapons, two-handed weapons, or one-handed + shield, with the option to fight at range using a bow. Prepare for the worst with alchemy — potions and brews can give you the edge when a single mistake can be fatal. Push into the island’s deadliest zones and take on several unique bosses, each demanding a different approach.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Key Features</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >• Dark, consequence-driven story in a world collapsing under plague, hunger, and war</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >• 20+ hour campaign with multiple endings</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >• Faction choice: join the Guards or the Hunters</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >• Combat progression: one-handed, two-handed, one-handed + shield, and bow</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >• Preparation matters: training, gear upgrades, and alchemy</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >• Unique boss encounters that reward tactics and planning</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Single-player focused.
