In the years since, the nearby town of Ravengro has shunned the fire-scarred ruins, telling tales of unquiet spirits that wander abandoned cellblocks. But when a mysterious evil disturbs Harrowstone's tenuous spiritual balance, a ghostly prison riot commences that threatens to consume the nearby village in madness and flames.
