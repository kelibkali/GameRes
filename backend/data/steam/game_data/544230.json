Your mouse is still greedy and now want to discover new areas and even more hungry to chase those mostly anti gravity cheeses, which is spread on the 16 levels big size. Its more logical thinking, more planning and more solve the various threats that is based on the original XOR game.... And the 16 levels is all quite hugo this time, and is all can been played in 3 normaly difficulties.<br><br>The 16 new levels can been found in the main village on the game on the left side.<br><br><br>Alternative Link to same pic<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/544230/extras/4c43cda48a1ce10873f9ddd9c98c1c72.webp?t=1509998802\" width=18 height=18 /></span> There is 16 new levels in the 32x32 tile size (XOR original size).<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/544230/extras/4c43cda48a1ce10873f9ddd9c98c1c72.webp?t=1509998802\" width=18 height=18 /></span> Dynamic is added to some Bombs and fish (its possible to spot the different).<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/544230/extras/4c43cda48a1ce10873f9ddd9c98c1c72.webp?t=1509998802\" width=18 height=18 /></span> Heavy based on the original XOR game, but is NOT a 100% remake.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/544230/extras/4c43cda48a1ce10873f9ddd9c98c1c72.webp?t=1509998802\" width=18 height=18 /></span> One mouse controlled, not two (modiciations was required to fit).",
