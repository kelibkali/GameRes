The adventure is suitable for a party of 8th level characters.<br><br>Savage battlecries and screams of pain echo through the streets and off the raw sheer walls that make up the carved stronghold of Forstor Nagar. The cannibalistic troops of The Hungering Legion have breached the gates, and the defenders have been routed.<br><br>Trapped in the heart of Forstor Nagar, the ambassador from Ithulandis, the City of Adventure, must be rescued. But the redoubt is cut from the living ice of the Forstorheim glacier, and enemies rip the very life from the inhabitants. Only scant hours remain before the alleys are slick with a crimson slush. Welcome to the Breaking of Forstor Nagar!<br><br>Adventurers must cross the invaders’ lines to infiltrate the fortress, locate the diplomatic compound and escape with the ambassador before filed teeth sink into thier flesh and the fate of the city is sealed forever. Beautifully rendered, full-color cartography brings Forstor Nagar to life, giving you a frozen city of glassy ice bridges, chilling meltwater canals, and fog shrouded secret tunnels—but only as the party explores them, maintaining a “fog of war” and interactive components like opening doors and chests. Detailed evocative tokens with suggested placement ensure that players easily imagine the forces hunting them throughout their mission.<br><br>This product is an installable module for use with the Fantasy Ground II virtual tabletop.
