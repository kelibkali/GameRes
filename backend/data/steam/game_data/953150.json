    "description": "TrivaTune is a music Trivia game where users compete in a multiplayer world to prove they are the music king, you will be asked questions with multiple choice options and possibly in the future even get presented with an audio question where a track is played to you and you have to guess who the artist is or what the title or album are and maybe even the release year is but the audio part is still in the development phase. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs our game grows we hope to add more modes and system to embrace the player even more in our fun quirky environments. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrivaTune is a pure passion project with a small team working to make the game in our vision, we want to capture those moments<br />\r\nin the car when your fave song comes on and you all start singing as if you were at the O2 arena. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSO please enjoy our game as much as we enjoy making it!",
