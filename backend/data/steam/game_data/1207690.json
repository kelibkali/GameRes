Tasked with tracking down the source of a strange transmission believed to have originated from somewhere within the region, she must navigate, survey and survive an eerie, ever-shifting landscape reclaimed by nature — and perhaps something stranger.<br><br><i>Work</i> heavily revolves around a combination of open-ended investigative and analytical work, in tandem with a detailed simulation-lite approach to representing the character's embodied physical experience at the level of moment-to-moment minutiae. It's also about haunted radio signals, and catastrophic signal failures, and the encroaching emptiness of wilderness, and the paradox of an empty tomb. And lastly, of course (although hopefully not ironically), it's about unfinished — and unfinishable — work.",
