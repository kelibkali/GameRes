    "description": "DMT, the Dynamic Music Tesseract, is a 3D visualization of vast <br>4-dimensional objects created by your music! <br><br> This is not for everyone, but the people who like it <strong>really </strong>seem to like it!<br><br> If you want to zone out listening to your music and watching trippy visuals, then this is for you.<br><br>o DMT will visualize whatever music you happen to be playing.  Just play<br>    your music like you normally would and DMT will visualize it.<br>    So, pick your favorite music app or service and use it to drive the visuals!<br><br>o #1 Tip: Just relax and let your eyes defocus.  Let it wash over you.",
