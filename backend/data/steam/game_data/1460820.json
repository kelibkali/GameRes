    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Aldriak, the advent of a new world takes place in a fantastic open world in which the player accompanies the heroes through their saga. It's an RPG turn-based strategy game inspired by the first games of the genre but with a new and original mechanic. This mechanic takes the form of 3 distinct rows in which all the fighters (players and creatures) are placed. Each skill requires being in a particular row and can only target by following certain rules.</i> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong><u>Innovative and complex combat system</u></strong> </p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Row system to give a new dimension to the turn by turn. The rows define the range of the attacks and allow, among other things, to define a tank role that is not doomed to use a taunt all the time to attract attacks on him. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >4 difficulties are available to satisfy both players who play to overcome challenges and those who play above all to live a story. </p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong><u>An original story</u></strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Aldriak lives his usual life as a well-known scientist of his time when transported to a world where technology does not seem to exist and where magic does exist. He meets a group of travelers who seek to stem the rituals of sacrifice that rule their world. Indeed, they tell Aldriak that they are forced to send their loved ones to be sacrificed so as not to suffer the wrath of the gods. But no one remembers who started this tradition, and what this wrath of the gods is. </p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >What are the reasons that compel the people to send sacrifices? </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >How did Aldriak get into this world?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong><u>Extensive character development</u></strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Specialization choices that completely change a hero's gameplay. If you take the warrior from the group, he can end his career as a Berserker or as a Guardian. In the first case, he will strike harder and harder as he loses life while in the second case, he will take care of protecting the group with defensive skills. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1460820/extras/25fa0ab70f9426f412671273c5922fff.avif?t=1761232573\" width=1560 height=878 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Points to be distributed at each level and which are not final.
