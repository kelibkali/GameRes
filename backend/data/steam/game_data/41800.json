Diplomacy is so last year. Gratuitous Space Battles cuts right to the chase of sci-fi strategy games, and deals with large, completely unjustified space battles between huge opposing space fleets.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >\t\t\t\t\tGratuitous Space Battles combines the visual appeal of an RTS, with the addictive unit-placement and design gameplay from tower defense games. In GSB, the player does not control individual ships at all during battle. The ships fight to a pre-determined set of orders and formations given to them by you before the battles. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >\t\t\t\t\tGSB casts you as supreme space admiral, tasked with the design of individual spaceships, and the composition of your fleet, as well as general orders of engagement. This is not a twitch-based real time arcade game like many an RTS, but a game of careful thought, planning and big-picture strategy. Huge space battles can be won or lost depending on just how cleverly you balanced the needs of defensive shielding and armor against the expensive punch of laser cannons and plasma torpedoes. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >\t\t\t\t\t</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >4 different unlockable player races</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Over 40 different ship hulls</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Over 120 spaceship modules</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Choice of skirmish vs AI, or never-ending survival mode </p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Play with different rules as each battle has different spatial anomalies to deal with.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Note that this game is 16 years old and that screen resolutions larger than 1920x1080 may result in some visual issues on certain screens.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p>",
