I am also learning on how to make platformers.<br>So basically when fitting everything together I came up <br>with this.<br><br>- The other reason why it has only 3 stages is because I am stil new<br>to the platform genre, so I am unaware if people will enjoy my game <br>or not.<br><br><strong>FIRST GAME WITH WALKABLE CHARACTER</strong><br><br>If I feel like people are really enjoying this new genre of game.<br>I may make more games like this. They haven proven to me<br>to be easyer to be made and required less effort then my<br>IDLE games.<br><br><strong>Maybe mix up a little bit in the future?</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >ABOUT THIS GAME</h2><br>Gordon Adventure is a 2D pixel art platformer, In this game you will be controlling Gordon,<br>And your goal is to dodge the spikes  and collect coins.
