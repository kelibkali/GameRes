Instead, each part of the ship has a specific purpose. If you destroy their weapon mounts, they won't be able to fire until they are repaired. If you take out their engines, they won't be able to evade as effectively. If you smash through the armor surrounding a room, the crew might be sucked into space. And so on.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Individual projectiles are simulated and strike the ship at specific points. The player will have to choose which areas of the ship they should target. Do they go after the weapons first? Maybe their weapons are protected by bubble shields.
