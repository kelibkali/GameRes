And strangely, Patricia feels like she's been there before.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >REMASTER UPDATE</h2><br>We've spent over two years tuning and improving DEAD SECRET CIRCLE.  Every shader has been rewritten, every character reworked, every scene re-lit for modern PCs.  We spent our COVID lockdown years working on this game, polishing every doorknob, rebuilding every scene.  Now you can play DEAD SECRET CIRCLE as it was meant to be played!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/671920/extras/56d51234c6795863c8c00fbc7ad44355.avif?t=1727305621\" width=600 height=628 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What To Expect</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> A creepy whodunit with a story that goes deep.
