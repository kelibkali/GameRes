Your owner's naughty son destroyed your aquarium, and now you're desperately in need of water! Use what little liquid is left on the floor to move around and retreat to a toilet bowl which might save your life, or... Flush you down into far more challenging realms, escaping which will require all of your agility and creativity!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1679910/extras/89cb9f7a3cf9e43bc045c1458c2b3932.poster.avif?t=1752696487\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1679910/extras/89cb9f7a3cf9e43bc045c1458c2b3932.webm?t=1752696487\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1679910/extras/89cb9f7a3cf9e43bc045c1458c2b3932.mp4?t=1752696487\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1679910/extras/fa9235ca5e05ebece07ef4db9647d5de.avif?t=1752696487\" width=600 height=90 /></span><br><br>There are two ways to traverse the levels in Blow &amp; Fly: rolling along the floor and blowing water out of your mouth, thus launching yourself in the opposite direction. Every time you hit the floor, you regain a small amount of liquid, just enough to get yourself into the air again. Utilize this ability to avoid hazards such as pitfalls or spikes, and make good use of the jump pads, gravity switches, keys and water drops to reach the safe haven with water.<br><br>If you wish to survive, you will need to master your abilities: for each obstacle you pass, there will be a greater challenge ahead!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1679910/extras/9f94f0294289148e78251978c2d67b53.poster.avif?t=1752696487\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1679910/extras/9f94f0294289148e78251978c2d67b53.webm?t=1752696487\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1679910/extras/9f94f0294289148e78251978c2d67b53.mp4?t=1752696487\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1679910/extras/506a5bd58f4c254203783642285703d6.avif?t=1752696487\" width=600 height=90 /></span><br><br>• Accessible Controls: the game's simple &quot;move &amp; aim&quot; controls are intuitive and easy to grasp for players of all skill levels.<br>• Over 70 Levels to Conquer: challenge your fish launching skills with over 70 puzzles of gradually increasing difficulty across 3 different environments.<br>• Discover Secrets: find hidden locations to reveal secret areas and new levels which turn the game's mechanics on their head.<br>• Unlock new Playable Fish: those who take on the extra challenges will be rewarded with new visuals for their in-game character.<br>• Collect all the Pearls: complete levels within a certain number of launches to be awarded a pearl.
