Because of these events, you find yourself trapped in a parallel reality, where every step brings you closer to a difficult and irreversible choice. You play as Tan Kyuu, awakening inside a futuristic underground complex filled with labyrinths, traps, and unfamiliar faces. Strangers surround you — people pulled into this place by forces beyond their understanding. There is a way forward, but no clear way back.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Explore</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Discover the underground complex: corridors, rooms, and hidden paths reveal pieces of the story.
