    "description": "Always Higher is a single-player sci-fi adventure shooter.<br><br>The future semi-destroyed world is divided into hundreds of districts competing with each other. The central government is weak. As the final encounter is approaching, confrontation between the two leading groups gets fierce. The only three things you know are that you are an agent infiltrated into the enemy’s secret laboratory with the aim to steal important data, that you need to escape, and that yours is a good cause.<br><br>But if it is so, why don’t you remember anything else?<br><br>The game uses all VR features available today to create an experience as immersive as possible. It’s not just a shooter or a simple puzzle game. To accomplish the goal – just like in the non-virtual reality – you need to be quick, watchful and smart.<br><br><i>Warning. The game requires SteamVR-compatible virtual reality headset with two tracked motion controllers and minimum 2x2 meter (6,6x6,6 ft) play area (however, 3x2 or more m is recommended).</i>",
