    "description": "Do you love the feeling of retro shoot-em up arcade style games?  Do you remember arcade classics like Tempest, Beam rider and Gyruss?  and most importantly, do you love Sci-Fi?  If the answer to any of those questions is yes then Temporal Storm X is the game made just for you.<br><br><strong>Temporal Storm X - Hyperspace Dream</strong> hearkens back to the days of retro arcade gaming we loved in the 1980's. It's slick neon style and pumping retro futuristic soundtrack bring the classic 1980's to the current day.   TS-HD-X is the non-vr version of this game, specifically re-balanced for a more traditional game play experience.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/678010/extras/74970b18c35601d9b22f9a3b9b5311d6.webp?t=1504784387\" width=600 height=40 /></span><br><br>Game-play is based around high pressure, ever increasing waves of enemies, missiles, plasma bolts, lasers and bombs sent down warp tunnels who's geometry gets more and more complex as the game progresses.  You only get one life to make it through the temporal storm, so this is no game for those of low skill.  The core design is built around a combination of button mashing and timed bomb bursts to get the most out of your score and to not only defeat the storm but to be the best at doing it.<br><br>Can you make it to the Top 10 in the world?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/678010/extras/cea20ac3471b1930e2105af67ab6de47.avif?t=1504784387\" width=600 height=74 /></span>",
