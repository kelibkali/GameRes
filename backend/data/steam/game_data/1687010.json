Deep down under our feet is a place full of Inspectors that inspect consumer food before it hits the supermarket shelf.<br><br>For real!<br><br>In this case we follow The Savoury Inspector and his new apprentice (that is you) on what turns out to be a not normal training day. A day that turns out to be not very savoury indeed.<br><br>Your mission?! To get graded without being failed and to have the most fun doing so.<br><br><strong>And why is this going to be so much fun?!</strong> Because the inspector is going to react to your actions and presence! That's right, a VR NPC you can actually prod, pull, throw things at, and be an all round pain-in-the-bum. And he'll let you know about it! Just... don't annoy him <i>too </i>much.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1687010/extras/26fb57fb2fb541dae05b9399f3d627a8.webp?t=1739198533\" width=601 height=48 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Physics based interactions.<br></li><li> Puzzles that’ll stretch the very sinews of your mind (a slight embellishment!)<br></li><li> Bad jokes (not embellished!)<br></li><li> NPC interactions and reactions to player’s presence and actions (the real fun!)<br></li><li> Receive a graded certificate recognised worldwide by the food authorities (not entirely truthful).<br></li><li> Professionally voiced by Mel Shiner (factually accurate).<br></li><li> Amazing music!
