Different games will utilize the Workshop in different ways. Some games, like Team Fortress 2, allow you to create and submit new items (such as hats, weapons, badges, boots, and more) for consideration to be incorporated into the actual game. Other games like Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim allow mod authors to publish their work directly to the Workshop, and let players subscribe to mods they want to use in their game. The acceptable items, entry rules, and rewards may be different for each product, so please read the instructions carefully to see where your skills and interests can have the most impact. By submitting an item to the Steam Workshop or accepting a revenue allocation for an item, you agree to the Legal Agreement.<br><br>As part of our Early Access communications, we will bring you updates on our Steam Workshop progress.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1453500/extras/00bcc83158bb6ca3c6e00b8b513b6b26.poster.avif?t=1698917482\" width=73 height=128 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1453500/extras/00bcc83158bb6ca3c6e00b8b513b6b26.webm?t=1698917482\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span>",
