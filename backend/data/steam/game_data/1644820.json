You should use the key arrows to jump and walk around the screen. However, the game also has a dark side — everything in this game can and will kill you.<br><br>We work hard to make each trap unique and each of your deaths sophisticated.<br>It’s going to take you a lot of time to figure out how each trap on your way works and get to the checkpoint.<br><br>You can't trust anything in this game! Every step you take, you risk losing your head, failing, being burned, eaten, trampled, broken morally and physically.<br>But don't worry — you won't know it until you take this step!<br><br>We are trying to make every creature in the game memorable and its animations &quot;alive&quot;, which is not typical for a pixel game.<br><br>Besides:<br>The game has a simple but absurd and humorous storyline.<br>We also working hard on music and sounds.<br><br><i>Bobby is the debut project of the &quot;Yo You Games&quot; studio.<br>This is a little game for a couple of nights that will give you a lot of fun and thrill.</i><br><br>discord: <br>twitter: ",
