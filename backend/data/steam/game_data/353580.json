    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Story</h2><strong>Rad</strong> is a rambunctious but spirited young boy who maybe plays too many video games. After dozing off at the tail end of a long night of gaming, Rad awakens to find his dusty old console has turned itself back on. Suddenly a vortex emerges and he's sucked into his TV, where he finds himself the star in his very own video game adventure.<br><br><strong>Dusty</strong> is Rad's good-hearted but foul-mouthed, now-sentient game console. His clock speed isn't what it used to be, but what he lacks for in megahertz he makes up for with experience and attitude!<br><br><strong>Rad &amp; Dusty's</strong> adventure begins in the First World, taking them through seven dangerous stages of action-packed, humor-filled, hardcore platforming fun. This decaying jungle world has been infected by a fierce corruption, and it's up to the unlikely buddy-duo Rad and Dusty to save the jungle's inhabitants and restore the Elder Tree as guardian of the land.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/353580/extras/7d8f45c80618ad405eef17a35c7066f0.poster.avif?t=1726565126\" width=628 height=182 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/353580/extras/7d8f45c80618ad405eef17a35c7066f0.webm?t=1726565126\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/353580/extras/7d8f45c80618ad405eef17a35c7066f0.mp4?t=1726565126\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><strong>Weapons</strong>: Dusty arms Rad with a variety of radical bad-ass weaponry. The Bolt Blaster has unlimited ammo, is easy to use, and more than enough firepower to get the job done. The Phoenix Cannon shoots out a fiery bird whose wingspan lights enemies ablaze as it flies by. There are 5+ weapons in this first chapter, with more to come.<br><br><strong>Sounds &amp; Music</strong>: Our composer Andrew Hulshult combined his years of musical experience (both performing and writing) with his passion for retro-style gaming to create an amazing and authentic soundtrack for the game complete with MIDI-inspired music... And synthesizers!<br><br><strong>The Pixelverse</strong>: While Rad and Dusty are a great team, only Dusty can enter the electrified Pixelverse -- a dangerous spacetime-breaking region that exists behind the game world. Dusty enters the Pixelverse when necessary to repair glitches in the running game world, allowing both Rad &amp; Dusty to continue their journey.<br><br><strong>Classic Easter Eggs</strong>: The game features hard-to-find collectibles in sometimes even harder-to-find classic secret rooms. Use your precision platforming skills to collect 'em all.",
