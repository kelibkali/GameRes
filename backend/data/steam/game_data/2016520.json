With this new found curiosity, the kitten chooses to follow it in hopes of finding something to help with their pain.<br><br>During the course of this adventure, you will be platforming through various different obstacles that are blocking your path by using your ability to peer into a different reality. While this other reality may be similar to your current one, it hides the key to getting past the challenges that block your way! However, it may also reveal different problems meaning you will need to be able to change between realities on the go or you may suffer a not so favourable fate!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2016520/extras/e848519c3418061dbcb7a27ebda2f1e8.avif?t=1755824048\" width=614 height=224 /></span><br><br>In this demo, you will play through the prologue and the first chapter of the kitten's story. The game's main mechanics will be introduced to you while not showing you every surprise that Forever Alone has in store so that if you do decide to purchase the full game, there will still be plenty of new abilities to play around and experiment with.<br><br>The game is made by one developer and a composer for the music meaning that this is a small demo which should set the tone and feel for the full release.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2016520/extras/b2369210808fb6f69a2c379c9bdf9bc4.avif?t=1755824048\" width=614 height=224 /></span><br><br>I hope you enjoy it and want to play more after trying this demo.",
