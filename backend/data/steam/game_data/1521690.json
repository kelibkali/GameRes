He never knows if he may break down so he collects them.<br><br>Our Hero: <strong>DR-32</strong>  is a little short for his taste but makes up for it in spunk. He has one goal to find the princess.  He won't let anything stand in his way.  His abilities include super sprinting, super sword slash and he jumps pretty well for a robot.

When your stamina runs out you'll need to wait as it recharges.<br><br>Our Princess: <strong>Amelia</strong> is a confident young princess.  She was kidnapped by some rogue sentry robots.   She waits anxiously for her captain of the guard DR-32 to save her.   <br><br>Our Enemies: <strong>Rogue Robots</strong> originally of the royal guard.
