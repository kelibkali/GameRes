    "description": "The Cosmo Story game is a classic arcade whose events take place both in open space on a spaceship and on the surface of various planets directly by the hero himself. On the surface of the planet, the hero needs to collect energy fuel for refueling the spacecraft. Having collected the necessary amount of fuel, the hero continues his journey, encountering resistance already in open space. Having made a long journey, the hero needs to destroy the main ship of the invaders, thereby winning. As you progress through the levels, the hero will acquire various technologies that will help him reach the finals. The game contains levels, both manually designed and procedurally generated. What allows you to make the levels each time unique. After passing the main company, you can continue the game at the generated, and more complicated levels, setting your own records.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGood luck!",
