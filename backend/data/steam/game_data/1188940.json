    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >  Marches Adventure 1: High and Dry</h2>In High and Dry the Travellers are given a ship in which they can explore the galaxy for the rest of the campaign - the only catch is that they have to find it first.<br>Travelling to the quiet world of Walston, the Travellers will have to engage with the locals, locate their ship and repair it before they can return home. However, the ship has been left in the crater of a volcano, and there have been tremors rocking the surrounding area for quite some time...<br>High and Dry is the perfect introductory adventure for Traveller, full of exploration, character interaction and a truly explosive finale!<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong></strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Traveller 2E (Mongoose) ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
