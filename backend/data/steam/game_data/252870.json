With clear communication and resolve, the Captain must be the link that coordinates the actions of the entire crew. As the Captain determines the route the crew will take—through both the galaxy itself and the hard choices they encounter—success is more often than not a reflection of his or her leadership.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Pilot</h2>The Pilot is responsible for flying the ship and navigating across sectors of space. Through management of different flight controls, a Pilot must maneuver the ship through debris, position it effectively during combat, and align it to the next sector for warp. Despite various flight styles in the field, most Pilots become one with their ships and make them extensions of themselves.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Scientist</h2>Scientists provide the crew with medical assistance and information about their current environment. As they possess superior technological prowess, Scientists have the responsibility of overseeing sensor sweeps, ship security, the breaching of enemy firewalls, and research. Furthermore, their skills are invaluable when developing strategies or exploring alien planets.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Weapons Specialist</h2>Guns, turrets, nukes—the Weapons Specialist manages them all. Operating lasers, missiles and any other combat related technologies, Weapons Specialists have the greatest direct impact in battle, and their aim can greatly sway the outcome of a fight. Apart from ship-to-ship combat, Weapons Specialists are also crucial in ship boarding and investigations of hostile environments.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Engineer</h2>The Engineer keeps the ship running. In addition to charging the warp drive and manning the startup switchboard, Engineers must continually maintain and repair vital ship systems, as well as control ship power flow to prevent overheating. Engineers make the most out of a reactor’s capabilities and balance power allocation for the greatest possible output.",
