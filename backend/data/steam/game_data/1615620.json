    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >     D&amp;D Classics - DMGR7 The Complete Book of Necromancers (2E)</h2><i>     Come, let us explore the art of necromancy together.</i><br>- Arch-Necromancer Kazerabet Necromancers like Kazerabet and their priestly counterparts have mastered many dark, forbidden secrets. This tome reveals these mysteries to the Dungeon Master, who will find new NPC kits and volumes of necromancer's minions, familiars, secret societies, poisons, magical items, enchanted tomes, and dozens of new wizard and priest spells, plus the deadly Isle of the Necromancers, a portable setting which can be placed into any existing campaign.<br><i>  <strong>     We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today. Some older content may reflect ethnic, racial, and gender prejudice that were commonplace in American society at that time. These depictions were wrong then and are wrong today. This content is presented as it was originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed. Dungeons &amp; Dragons teaches that diversity is a strength, and we strive to make our D&amp;D products as welcoming and inclusive as possible.
