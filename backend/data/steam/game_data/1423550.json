    "description": "In his collaboration with the Burnett brothers, German composer Christoph Jakob was brought to the table in order to add the musical accompaniment to their local multiplayer game Twin Stick Heroes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDrawing inspiration from several other twin stick shooters, as well as Splatoon and Sonic Rush, this release has a strong focus on experimentation. A culmination of catchy synthesizer melodies, rad slap bass lines and hard driving drum beats to keep the players incited.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to being your sonic companion during the game, the music in this album is intended to be enjoyable as a standalone soundtrack for a short and casual listening experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe album contains 6 tracks delivered in high quality MP3 (320 kbps) and has a total length of 16 minutes.",
