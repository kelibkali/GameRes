Picross has been around for quite some time.

Unlike traditional games which limit your puzzle to one grid, our puzzles consist of 3 layers.  As a portion of each layer is colored in, the final image will begin to form based on how all 3 layers blend together.   Ensure each layer is correct, and you'll reveal the final image and solve the puzzle!</li></ul>",
