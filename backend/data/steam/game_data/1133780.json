    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" style=\"text-align: center\">--- Game ---</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Bandit the game is a single-player open-world action RPG with optional tower defense elements. You play as a character named Argos who fights for survival in a vast world full of dangers such as powerful beasts, dragons, trolls, and other creatures, as well as corrupt guards and the undead. But fear not, you have plenty of ways to rid the world of them. You have swords, axes, hammers, bows, skills, magic, and summoned creatures at your disposal. The world is vast and ready to be explored, with hand-designed dungeons and a world. You start as a lowly bandit, but you can end up as a hero or villain depending on your decisions while completing various tasks. Beside saving the world, you can spend your time mining minerals, cutting down trees, gathering plants, or hunting creatures for resources... to create new weapons, tools, armor, and more. Or you can use these resources to construct new buildings, defensive towers, mines... simply to create your own small town.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" style=\"text-align: center\">--- Character ---</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >With each level, you gain power. When you fill the experience bar, you will receive learning points and blueprint points. Learning points can be used to develop attributes, skills or magic. Blueprint points can be used to unlock new crafting and city-building blueprints. Some blueprints can also be purchased or found.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" style=\"text-align: center\">--- Weapons ---</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The game features dozens of different weapons, including one-handed and two-handed swords, axes, hammers, shields, and bows, as well as a wide range of skills (related to the selected weapon type), such as kicks, Battle cry, and earthquakes. If you prefer the path of magic, there is also a lot to choose from: three different schools of magic. They offer offensive, defensive, and support spells. You have access to spells such as healing, fireball, lightning, fire rain, summoning various creatures, teleportation, and many more.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" style=\"text-align: center\">--- Enemies ---</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You will encounter dozens of different creatures in the world. At the beginning of the game, most of them will be much stronger than you, so you must first find the weakest ones. You will probably die many times trying to defeat them, but death has no consequences. Over time, you will grow stronger, you will feel the difference, and it will give you the feeling of actually growing in strength. You will encounter goblins, undead, giant worms, spiders, trolls, golems, and many creatures you have probably never seen before. You will also meet NPCs: both hostile and friendly, wielding various weapons.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" style=\"text-align: center\">--- Exploration ---</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The world has been designed by hand, every city, dungeon, cave, and forest and more. You won't encounter a randomly generated world; I tried to make each location as unique as possible. You'll find plenty of hidden items, exploration rewards, weapons, and much more. You'll also find anomalies that you'll have to fight your way through if you want to earn artifacts.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" style=\"text-align: center\">--- Building a base/city ---</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The game allows you to build your own small city (optional), which will be invaded from time to time. You can build defensive towers and soldiers to defend it, but they need to have their requirements met in order to work. You can build mines, farmland, and houses for workers. You can build ready-made buildings or construct them from components. You can decorate them inside and out, and different buildings serve different functions. It's not as complicated as it might sound; it's a simple system, after all, it's not an RTS or management game. Or you can just build your base and defend yourself. Or you can send out raids and manage your gang.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" style=\"text-align: center\">--- Crafting ---</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You can cut down any tree, break most rocks, mine minerals, and collect resources from dead creatures and plants. You will find resources of a various quality. You can use them to craft food, potions, rings, medallions, armor, and weapons, or use them to build your base/city.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This game is being created by just one person with no budget! From gamer for gamers, out of love for games.</p>",
