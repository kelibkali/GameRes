    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Mythic Monsters #6: Oozes Too</strong></h2><strong>The sixth volume in our new Mythic Monsters series, Mythic Monsters: Oozes Too brings you a dozen and one disgusting globulent monstrosities seeping up from dungeons deep and caverns old to devour and dissolve everything in sight! Twelve of your favorite awful oozes are here, updated for the mythic rules, and when we say updated we mean complete stat blocks, yes, but more than that every unearthly and indescribable amorphous abomination has its own unique and exciting mythic abilities, from a mythic giant amoeba's fissile filth to the cage of shards and crystallic wave of a mythic carnivorous crystal.</strong><br><i>This product includes mythic oozes that are variants of more familiar oozes, like the frost cube and sorcerous cube, or the dun pudding and crystal ooze, as well as far stranger creatures like the pastoral but deadly garden ooze and or the otherworldly and awe-inspiring plasma ooze, covering CRs from 2 to 20. In addition to a dozen existing oozes and variants, Mythic Monsters: Oozes Too also includes spells and a new mythic path ability for creating and controlling your own oozy horrors. To top it all off, Mythic Monsters: Oozes Too introduces an entirely new 13th mythic ooze, the swift and sinister sonic slime, a congealed echo of the eldest words of creation, given form and awareness and a terrible shattering hunger, though those who listen carefully to its deadly thrum can hear within it still the far-off voices of the primordial gods.</i><br>The Mythic Monsters series from Legendary Games brings you dynamic and exciting mechanics alongside evocative and cinematic new abilities that really help creatures live up to their flavor text, whether they are creatures of real-world myth and legend or creatures born out of the RPG tradition itself. These creatures can work just as well in a non-mythic campaign as they do in one that incorporates the full mythic rules, as you can throw them at your jaded players who think theyve seen it all or know the standard monster stats as well as you do. That look of surprise and What was THAT? will warm any GMs heart.<br>This supplement is a terrific complement to the Mythic Monster Manual, with over 220 mythic monsters and an awesome array of monster-focused abilities, feats, and more for your Pathfinder game!
