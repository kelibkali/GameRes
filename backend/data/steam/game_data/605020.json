SUNSET OF VALLEY (01:01)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIntro is what greets you to Mountain Mind world in a calmly manner, with layered solos.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAsteroid Blues is the fusion between rather Homme like riffs with heavily tuned and toned guitar, with a lenghty solo to accompany.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nXardoz is the heaviest and darkest piece of Mountain Mind, you will not be able to stop yourself from headbanging with these heavy riffs and solos behind them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike Tears In Rain intro appeared from the thin line between blues and stoner rock, continued to its stoner form with heavy riffs and a vocal to accompany.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPalm Desert '87 is the fastest piece on EP with its well settled riff and layered solos at the end. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGoddess of Time is a one shot improvisation record which takes its inspiration from Colour Haze, it's a journey to live by.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSunset of Valley is the calm end of the experience, watching sunset in the valley.",
