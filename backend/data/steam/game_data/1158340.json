    "description": "The soundtrack of Empires in Ruins was born as an integral part of the project: a grim, sarcastic, folk-metal , with strong medieval influences in the melodies, led by a sharp bagpipe sound, and supported by heavy metal riffs and drums.<br><br>The members of the Red Dew Hellpipes band: <i>Alberto Cantilena</i> (Bass guitar), <i>Davide Frattarola</i> (Drums),<i> Francesco Guerrucci</i> (Guitar and Mixing) and <i>Lino Pastorelli</i> (Bagpipes and Composition) spent several months working together to contribute, each with his own style, to an organic and inspired soundtrack. <br>To further enhance the variety and quality, some musicians joined the band with their unique instruments and sounds: <i>Dino Tron</i> (Accordion, Tracks 03, 05), <i>Roberto Bonazinga</i> (Contrabass, Tracks 01, 02) and <i>Emmanuel Biamonti </i>(Flutes, Track 04).<br><br>We do really hope you will enjoy listening to this album as much as we did enjoy creating it!<br><br>The celtic songs played in the main nap, they are courtesy of the Tribauta band and you can contact us directly for more information.",
