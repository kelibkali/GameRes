Throughout the game, Cera is taught real life therapy tools to help her handle her anxiety and cultivate meaningful friendships. Players gain insight to what therapy actually feels like, breaking the stigma surrounding it. <br><br><strong>Choose the Healthy Choice, not the Friendly Choice</strong><br>Many visual novels reward over-friendly options and pushing yourself onto characters. In Call Me Cera, the Player is rewarded by matching the vibes and intentions of the NPCs instead of forcing friendship. Call Me Cera explores how to build trust and foster healthy relationships in real life, recognize one’s distortions in thinking, and role model changes in thought and behavior patterns as seen in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1523870/extras/e2e1c32c869730027549c7c005045ed9.webp?t=1726499101\" width=450 height=49 /></span><br><br>Call Me Cera takes place in a fictional Northeast coastal town in the United States called Fernweh (pronounced Fern - Vee), with a strong LGBTQIA+ and diverse community.
