At the beginning of each game, you choose four spells that need Halzae's essence, which you pick up in the arena, so that you can fire them. Use them wisely to take down your opponents! Break the ultimate crystal to unleash extremely powerful spells on all enemies, or heal your allies! In this demo, you will have one Hero, Kara, on the Egyptian arena, Ra's Temple, and in TeamDeathMatch. Explore the game, and don't forget to go to our Kickstarter page right here!<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >CHOOSE YOUR SPELLS</h2></li></ul>At the beginning of the game, you choose your character, who has a basic attack and a specific capacity, and four spells, among all the spells of the game.
