Picross has been around for quite some time.  You may also know them as Nonograms, Hanjie, Pic-a-Pix, Paint by Numbers, or Griddlers.  <strong><i>However</i></strong>, we have a secret twist to our puzzles!  Unlike traditional games which limit your puzzle to one grid, our puzzles consist of 3 layers.  As a portion of each layer is colored in, the final image will begin to form based on how all 3 layers blend together.   Ensure each layer is correct, and you'll reveal the final image and solve the puzzle!</li></ul></li></ul>",
