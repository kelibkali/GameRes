The cosmically rich take &quot;hypercruises,&quot; allowing them to see the most spectacular parts of the universe from the comfort of luxurious cabins. One such cruiser of the DestinyCorp fleet, the Dougherty, recently vanished without a trace while on a piloting voyage.<br>The Dougherty had just come into orbit of a truly unique phenomenon, a moon orbiting a black hole, Scylla and Charybdis, respectively. Charybdis, the name DestinyCorp gave the<br><strong> black hole, is the first humanity has seen of its kind. Scylla, a moon made of ice, impossibly orbits the black hole. It was anticipated that this would be the veritable jewel in the crown<br>of the Dougherty's newest cruise voyage, but as soon as it arrived to its destination all traces of the ship vanished.<br>Wanting to discover what happened to its prized cruise liner, DestinyCorp dispatched a small shuttle to embark on a recovery mission--your mission!<br>Moon at the Edge of Oblivion is a Savage Tale for the Savage Worlds roleplaying game system.
