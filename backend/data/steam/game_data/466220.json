    "description": "<strong>IMPORTANT: THIS GAME WILL BE WITHDRAWN FROM STEAM SALES SOON. UNFORTUNATELY WE CAN NOT DO IT OURSELVES AND NEED TO WAIT FOR STEAM TO REACT TO OUR REQUEST. IT MOST PROBABLY WILL BE RELAUNCHED AS FREE TO PLAY.</strong><br><br><strong>Inspired by the classic 16-bit ARPGs of last decades, KINGDOM·OF·LOOT is a brand-new, completely unique game. It's an ode to the classic 2D action-arcade games such as Secret of Mana™ or The Legend of Zelda™, that became a fundamental part of gaming history and captivated players for many years.</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/466220/extras/e36faa8c0a158743ce1252a5147f28fb.avif?t=1684277833\" width=616 height=616 /></span><br><br><strong>KINGDOM·OF·LOOT</strong> seeks to bring back the timeless feel of these classics while answering the question: how would they have been if based in a global mass multiplayer system? An immersive persistent world to explore, tons of loot to collect, new friendships to forge and adventures to live and strongly focuses on collecting, crafting and sharing in-game loot. You decide whether doing it on your own, with a small group of friends, a guild or joining hundreds of other players on your quest for epic gear.<br><br>We are a small but dedicated team located in Germany. If you want to follow up on the development of KINGDOM·OF·LOOT we recommend you to check out our<br>YouTube Channel: <br><br>Player Gideun created a guide for new and experienced adventurers to the world of Arcadia.<br>",
