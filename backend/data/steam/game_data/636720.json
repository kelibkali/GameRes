Combined with our special AI, we are able to increase or decrease the intensity and scare factors in the game based on your heart rate. If you have a supported heart rate device, the game will know when you’re not scared enough- and scare you more!<br><br>If you do not have a device, don’t worry. We will be influencing the events based on the heart rates of others who do and you will be sharing in the most frightening, scariest game with them!",
