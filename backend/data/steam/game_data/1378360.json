    "description": "Enter White Hell, a retro-style first-person shooter set in post-apocalyptic Finland. A lone survivor, Jarmo, wakes up on his toilet floor after hibernating through the apocalypse and has to fight his way through the frozen wastelands controlled by opposing extremist groups.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Weapons: from familiar to foreign</h2>From the classic pump-action shotgun to a sword powered by eldritch energy, White Hell provides a familiar although unique arsenal of weapons.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A journey across a frost-bound land ...and beyond</h2>After humble beginnings in an apartment building, your journey leads you through overtaken cities, secret research facilities, dangerous wilderness, and into another dimension.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The enemy of my enemy is my enemy</h2>The dystopian civilization of White Hell is firmly divided into two factions: the fascist Order of the Blue Eagle and the communist Red Tomorrow. Both parties are more than willing to exterminate outside threats, which include you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Unleash the power of SISU</h2>Jarmo can gather magical SISU-energy by defeating his enemies. This energy can be used to activate SISU-mode, which transforms your weapons into super-powered versions with new features.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Tunes for kicking doors down</h2>The game features an original MIDI soundtrack by ULTRAKILL creator/composer Arsi &quot;Hakita&quot; Patala complete with 90s-style soundfonts.",
