    "description": "A cooking and time management game in VR. The player has to make the orders of the customers while managing the kitchen. The player will use the ingredients and different stations around them to make the order of the customer and serve it before the customer becomes angry. As the player plays more levels, the game will become harder and new recipes will be added to the burger joint. You will have to serve whacky combos like the Dynamic Duo and the Meat Flusher Combo. Stay sharp, you don't want anything catching fire. Don't waste resources otherwise you won't make a profit.",
