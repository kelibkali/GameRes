    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong><u>Overview</u></strong></h2><strong>Externus: Path of the Solari</strong> is a character-driven tactical roleplaying game (RPG) adapted from an original tabletop game. We take inspiration from classic tactical RPGs along with modern game development to craft our own story and give you characters that matter. Our approach is designed to allow you to get to know the characters in your party along with strategic combat in full 3D environments. We encourage party interaction through our campfire scenes and storybook sequences that pay homage to the original tabletop game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong><u>Features</u></strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Strategic Turn-Based Tactical Combat<br></li><li>Full 3D Battlefields<br></li><li>Character-Driven Story<br></li><li>Storybook Choose Your Own Adventure Sequences<br></li><li>Death Matters, Each Ally You Lose Will Change Your Story<br></li><li>Unique Full-Color Artstyle<br></li><li>Based On An Original Tabletop RPG </li></ul><br>We're currently expecting to launch the game in the Summer of 2021.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong><u>Gameplay</u></strong></h2><strong>Externus: Path of the Solari </strong>features classic turn-based gameplay. Our battles will take place in <strong>full 3D battlefields</strong> that allow you to rotate the camera a full 360 degrees. Our character-driven story will be told using those battlefields alongside interactive story sequences featuring custom artwork. You can traverse our world using a map that highlights the two distinct continents that make up the world of Externus. The world map features unique artwork inspired by early cartography.  <br><br><strong>Externus: Path of the Solari</strong> uses a turn-based battle system that takes advantage of our full 3D battlefields to make sure you can see all angles of the battlefield. This will help you weigh all your options from a tactical standpoint. The detailed battlefields feature elevation and other tactical landscapes to use to your advantage when facing your opponent. Sometimes it's just easier to push someone off a cliff, right? Your choices make all the difference in combat.<br><br>Our goal for the battle system in <strong>Externus: Path of the Solari</strong> is to challenge the player so that they feel accomplished in defeating their foes. You should think about the risks and rewards of bringing certain characters and using their specialized abilities. Your actions and choices matter. Think about the world in terms of fate. Was it fate that a character died? Was it a punishment from the gods or just a mistake caused by an error in tactics? Death will be permanent in Externus, how will you react? Let the story play out and see how a character's death affects those who knew them both in positive and negative ways. Maybe it'll even send a ripple effect out into the world!<br><br><strong>Externus: Path of the Solari</strong> is a storybook brought to life and your actions on and off the battlefield can change the pages as they're presented. This goes back to our tabletop roots of wanting to tell a collective story that changes based on the players around the table.<br><br><strong><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story</h2></u></strong><br>The world of <strong>Externus: Path of the Solari</strong> was crafted through years of playing the tabletop game and was a world created with friends. Fate plays a large role in our world as the balance between order and chaos is constantly shifting. We find ourselves in a time where two Gods have been slain by a powerful unknown enemy. Was fate in play here or did the Gods' time end before it was supposed to? Can even the Gods escape Fate or will the world be plunged into chaos?<br><br>The story of <strong>Externus: Path of the Solari</strong> follows Osmund Steele and his sons Alrik and Amante as they travel through the continents of Alcretia and Katrona. Osmund is part of an order known as the Soldat Solari, a tradition he intends to pass down to his sons, that is tasked with keeping balance and order throughout the world of Externus. Our story begins as we follow the Steele family and their companions on their way toward the town of Zyais when they run into unexpected trouble from a mysterious group known as The Monotheists. This group of zealots is led by a man named Gabriel who has a history with Osmund and the Soldat Solari. Was it fate that brought them together on this day? Was it the will of the gods? With Gabriel in the picture and rumors swirling of a larger threat, known only as The Abomination, the Steele family will have a lot of roadblocks in their way as they try to keep the balance of the world from shifting into chaos. Will your choices balance things or plunge them further into chaos? What does Fate have in store for you and your companions? Death matters in the world of Externus and losing an ally can change the story.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong><u>About Winterborn</u></strong></h2><strong>Winterborn</strong> was formed by Kent Gambill in November of 2018 to make a tactical role-playing game set in a world he created over 15 years ago as a tabletop game.
