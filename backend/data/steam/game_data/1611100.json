    "description": "It is a 3D isometric top-down roguelite that tells the story of Schell, a small humanoid creature enslaved to mine metals, who tries to escape from the depths of dangerous caves infested with enemies and traps. She will face off against King Grunt‘s Kobold army and his generals. To reach freedom, she will receive help from other small creatures and will be guided by the essence of an ancient alchemist, who will teach her how to create potions and give useful tips.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 3D game consists of an isometric top-down of the Roguelite / Action / RPG genre, in which the main character, Schell, tries to escape from three levels, arranged in random rooms of caves full of enemies and traps to finally reach the freedom. She is guided by the essence of an ancient alchemist, Kimi, who helps her create Bombs and gives her tips on how to defeatthe enemies she encounters along her journey.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the main pillars of the game is the bomb creation system. There are very important tools to strengthen Schell and control the game's difficulty. With each raid, the player can choose different weapons, bombs and accessories.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe player uses his bombs and weapons to defeat enemies, while dodging attacks with his mobility ability. Schell's weapon attacks can be connected by combos or strong attacks, while bombs have a different damage area for eachtype of flask and a cooldown. The world takes place inside a cave with different biomes and rooms to explore. Wagons are the means of transport that NPCs use to move around the cave. It is with the wagons that they can cross new biomes, passing from the bottom of the cave to the Kobold Domains.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures<br />\r\n<br />\r\n• Great Combat: Fight hordes of enemies using different weapons, bombs and even the environment. Throw up the enemies! Throw them down to the abyss! Burn them! Create your own tactics and have lots of fun!<br />\r\n• Make your own bombs: There’s no recipes! Create your own bombs and customize them and their effects! Just changing the vial is possible to transform an explosion in a barrier. You can even create a water bomb that can burn your enemy!<br />\r\n• Interactive environment: Burn! Pull! Electrify! Through alchemy, you can gain vantage against enemies and actiave traps!<br />\r\n• The Headquarters Dilemma: Opt between protecting your own base and allies, or invest in wagon upgrades and try to escape from the cave with the whole party!<br />\r\n• Crafting and Customization: Choose which type of alchemist you want to be! Make your own decisions, choose your weapons, your accessories and your bombs. Customize your headquarters and raise your survival chance!<br />\r\n• Unexpected Mentor: The soul of an ancient master alchemist will guide Schell to escape from the caves. But this relationship will be really messy and funny!",
