    "description": "The goal of each level is to assemble a word or even a whole sentence from letters that are part of certain mechanisms and are controlled by them. Pick up the right letters or symbols, insert into the cells, adapt to difficult conditions and do not fall into deception. Try - It's Easy!<br><br>Regarding the innovations: The game is a big work on the mistakes of the last part of the series. Therefore, it has become much more convenient and easier to play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Play as convenient:</strong> The game has 2 levels of difficulty, one is suitable for beginners and does not require much effort from the player, the second is suitable for those who are familiar with Blueprint Word.<br></li><li><strong>Too difficult for me:</strong> Do not know how to solve the puzzle? You can skip the level and try to pass it later.<br></li><li><strong>Everyone is mistaken:</strong> I lost several moves because of an error - just wind the mechanisms a few steps back.<br></li><li>Over 120 levels.<br></li><li>4 new types of mechanisms.<br></li><li>Improved gameplay.</li></ul><br>The game has four categories of levels, each of which involves the use of certain mechanisms. The very first of them is the usual gear, which remained unchanged, the other three are completely new.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/955190/extras/ec6d8f2b5ab1cf793fb954f5fe6e1743.avif?t=1544010665\" width=616 height=347 /></span><br><br>Each category contains 30 unique levels, and the levels can combine the mechanisms from the previous categories.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >&quot;Valve&quot;</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/955190/extras/812458b6d97da0495f8e154da470bbdf.poster.avif?t=1544010665\" width=616 height=332 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/955190/extras/812458b6d97da0495f8e154da470bbdf.webm?t=1544010665\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/955190/extras/812458b6d97da0495f8e154da470bbdf.mp4?t=1544010665\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Using the gear allows you to rotate all the nearest cells around it, both clockwise and counterclockwise. It is important to understand that all cells are not part of the gears before they are activated, this means that the cells located next to one gear (for example, left or right) can take part in the rotation of the other, which in fact allows you to move the cells to the right places.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >&quot;Rotator&quot;</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/955190/extras/c61bf47a76db07905f920a7069ece8da.poster.avif?t=1544010665\" width=616 height=332 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/955190/extras/c61bf47a76db07905f920a7069ece8da.webm?t=1544010665\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/955190/extras/c61bf47a76db07905f920a7069ece8da.mp4?t=1544010665\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>A rotator is a kind of gear, but it works a little differently.
