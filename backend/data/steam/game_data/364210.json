However, due to visibility issues, Valve suggested we switch to paid app with both episodes 1 and 2 in it. <strong>This means Sierra Ops is now technically an Early Access title.</strong> <br>The price of the game is currently $14.99 USD which includes episodes 1 and 2. Once the full expansion patch is released, the price will be adjusted to $24.99 USD (cheaper than initially planned with episodes 2-4 as $9.99 USD x 3 DLCs). We sincerely apologise for any confusion this may have caused.</i>",
