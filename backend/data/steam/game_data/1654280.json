    "description": "A new twist on anagrams, <strong>Anagraphs</strong> is a <strong>free</strong> puzzle designed to challenge your linguistic and spatial skills.<br><br>Anagraphs extends the concept of anagrams by including letters that can be rotated to make other characters. In a typical anagram the letters can be re-arranged to form new words (&quot;ma&quot; and &quot;am&quot; for example) but in Anagraphs, the &quot;m&quot; character can be rotated to form a 'w' which allows for the word &quot;aw&quot; to be included.<br><br>Built with a specially designed font with several characters that can be rotated in such a way, Anagraphs is a challenging linguistic puzzle where you must optimize paths to earn stars used to unlock new levels. Anagraphs is a spiritual successor to the popular word game, <i>Synonymy</i>.<br><br>Anagraphs is free, with open source on GitHub. It was developed by <i>Cinq-Mars Media</i>, an educational non-profit with projects and games featured at E3, PAX and festivals worldwide.",
