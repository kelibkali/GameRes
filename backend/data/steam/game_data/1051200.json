    "description": "Your dogs have been dognapped by a beaked lunatic named Glorkon who stuffed them into his eye holes and is using their life essence to destroy the universe. You're partnered with Trover, a little purple eye-hole monster who isn’t a huge fan of working or being put in the position of having to save the universe. He’s also not that big a fan of you quite frankly, and neither am I. (Jk, you’re great)<br><br>Only you and Trover can save everything in this bizarre comedy adventure, created by Squanch Games!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>A comedy adventure</strong> filled with combat, platforming, puzzles, and morally questionable choices. See how the best intentions can go horribly awry.<br><br></li><li><strong>You control Trover's movements</strong>, but not his mouth. He’s got a lot to say about what’s going on in the game.<br><br></li><li><strong>Travel the cosmos</strong> to experience a variety of weird alien planets and bizarre characters with big personalities.<br><br></li><li><strong>Upgrade Trover AND YOURSELF</strong> with new abilities to (hopefully) defeat Glorkon while evading awkward situations.<br><br></li><li><strong>You'll be immersed in weirdness</strong>, no matter which display you use -- play on TV, monitor or VR headset displays.<br><br></li><li><strong>BONUS! INCLUDES FREE DLC:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong> JOPO MODE: A new way to play!<br><br></strong></li><li><strong>IMPORTANT COSMIC JOBS: Explore Trover's workplace to help co-workers, prevent grievous harm, and unlock original comedy sketches.</strong></li></ul></strong></li></ul>",
