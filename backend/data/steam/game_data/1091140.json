The game is deeply rooted in the lumberjack folklore. It’s a setting as unknown to the general public as it's full of quaint, strange creatures known as fearsome critters.<br><br>You play as one such critter, a jackalope - a hare with deer antlers - named Jack. Jack sets out to help a lumberjack named Jacob find his missing children. During their adventure they will encounter dozens of weird, magical creatures – a filla-ma-loo bird, a hidebehind, a treesqueak and many others. More importantly, both of our heroes will meet the mysterious Elders of the Forest and try to aid them in restoring balance in within the forest.<br><br>Meanwhile, a different yet terrifying being lurks in the shadow and watches the duos every step. Why is the Wendigo - a fearsome critter bound on bringing endless winter to the land – interested in Jacob and Jack? What about Jacob – is there something more to him than meets the eye?<br><br>The forest is full of secrets and wonder.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1091140/extras/9bb350c0ce4220f618358f37c87ddfdd.avif?t=1559203504\" width=300 height=80 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Meet the magical and grotesque fearsome critters of the lumberjack folklore<br></li><li>Control two characters at once to solve challenging puzzles<br></li><li>Experience an intriguing story about the endless and chaotic character of nature<br></li><li>Immerse yourself in a fairytale-like world</li></ul>",
