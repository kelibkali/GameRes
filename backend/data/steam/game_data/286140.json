    "description": "Eidolon is a game about exploring a mysterious landscape and uncovering the stories of the people who lived there once before. It is a game about history, curiosity, interconnectedness, and the slow and inevitable beauty of life.<br><br>You will be dropped into the dreary and mystical Western Washington circa 2400 c.e. with little to guide your way. Awaiting you is a vast landscape filled with wildlife, edible plants, and the memories of our now-dead culture—stored in artefacts such as journals, sketchbooks, newspapers, zines, brochures, transcripts, blogs, and more. Collect these memories and piece together what happened to these people.<br><br>Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Over 150 documents telling the interconnected stories of dozens of characters across hundreds of years.<br></li><li>An enormous, hand-sculpted Western Washington that takes multiple hours to cross.<br></li><li>Day/night cycle and dynamic weather.<br></li><li>Varied flora and fauna (both predators and prey).</li></ul><br>MAC USERS: Please read system requirements carefully!",
