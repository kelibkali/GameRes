After a recent tax break, legendary entrepreneur Elon Mustard has decided to set off to Mars with his family in order to begin achieving his goals of a utopian space society. Although rich and handsome, he can't do it all alone, so he has assembled one of the most advanced robots in the history of mankind to help get the job done. It's up to you to help Elon succeed in his quest by venturing throughout the planet, managing the farm and resources, uncovering secrets from a past civilization and stabilizing the ecosystem, all while surviving the elements, racking up that filthy Doge, and evading the wrath of humanities greatest supervillain, Geoff Benzos. Will you be able to succeed in this voyage and build the groundworks for civilizations millennia to come?",
