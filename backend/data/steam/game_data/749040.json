Battle Runner is a casual runner with difficult, random, procedurally generated levels. You're the fighter, travelling to new lands seeking quests, fame and an adventure - time waits for no one so you'll have to run fast, and there will be many obstacles in your way which you'll have to pass through carefully.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Controls:<br>LMB (Left Mouse Button)<br>'W' Key<br>'Up' Arrow key </h2><br><br><br>I have been learning to make games in my free time and love making small arcade and mini games with simple mechanics. Please expect 'Battle Runner' to be a small, <br>re-playable, score-chaser game where the only goals are to constantly beat your previous score.<br><br>Music for the game is royalty-free under the cc0 and was created by Phyrnna.",
