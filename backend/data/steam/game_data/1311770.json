We believe that when visitors to ZOO WORLD VR are done, they’ll have experienced a version of travel that will help them relate to their environment and consider adopting a greener world-view.<br>For a variety of reasons, many people just aren’t able to travel. With ZOO WORLD VR, we enable our visitors to experience biomes across the globe that would normally be off-limits to them. We also want to offer animal encounters that are more natural and friendly than you might experience in a traditional zoo.</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1311770/extras/692f11630ef2bf8073452d05aeef5fdb.avif?t=1614815767\" width=576 height=226 /></span><br><br><br><strong>ZOO WORLD VR represents more than just a group of interactive locations.
