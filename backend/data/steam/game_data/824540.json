You slay from little monsters to challenging bosses with your bow, axe and with your mighty hammer (I'm not even joking, is Thor's hammer). With every wave you get stronger and stronger, get more perks and more passive abilities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> creative perks and passives that synergies between them</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> various weapons &amp; crazy weapons to slay them all</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story</h2>The story is that...there's no story; you are stranded in an adventure with your bow and your little friend (spoiler, you'll have a companion)...and you don't need for some arbitrary reason to kill all the enemies that attack your castle (well you don't own it, the castle is a rental)..the truth is that is way to fun to slay the little monsters",
