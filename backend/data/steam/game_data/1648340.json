Lava is slowly rising and you need to make sure that you don't fall in. While at the same time trying to punch and dive into other players to push them off. Every game is different with the use of Items that enhance the experience. use them either to help yourself or eliminate others. Obstacles and other props are used around the maps to make every game unique! <br><br>Play amongst 6 different levels and experience something NEW and FUN every time!<br><br>How long can you survive ? and are you the best pusher our there ?<br><br>The game features 6 different maps, along with customizable modifiers to change up your gameplay. whether its playing the &quot;CRAZY MODE&quot; or disabling items every game will be fun. We know that playing games can be a big time commitment. That's why we wanted to create an enjoyable game that wont waste your time. Round times depend up to you and your skill but roughly last up to 3 minutes. This give you the best opportunity to play the game and do other activities in the meantime. You can play up to 4 players with a minimum of 2. <br><br>We also wanted to ensure that everyone could play so we added keyboard, Xbox, PlayStation and other controller support. That way anyone anywhere can play.
