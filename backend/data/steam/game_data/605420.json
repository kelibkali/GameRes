    "description": "Fast-paced puzzle fun in VR!  Easy enough for anyone to enjoy as their first VR experience, yet quickly complex enough to challenge the hardcore gamer. Ship It takes the shape-fitting fun of Tetris and reimagines it as a silly factory where you pack boxes to earn your wage.  Frantically maneuver your hands to grab the colorful shapes and fit them into their matching boxes.  If you pack efficiently you will climb the leaderboard and maybe not lose your job to the robotic Employee of the Month, K3-VN. <br><br>This demo includes the employee 'Training 101' and three levels to try the basic 'Deadline' mode puzzles.<br><br>Full version includes:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>5 gameplay modes each with uniquely addictive music and gameplay<br></li><li>Career progression<br></li><li>Multiple locations to explore<br></li><li>Online leaderboards for each level<br></li><li>35+ different puzzle levels<br></li><li>Unique new 'Special Order' puzzle every day<br></li><li>More coming soon...</li></ul>",
