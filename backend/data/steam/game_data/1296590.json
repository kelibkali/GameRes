Elven Voices delves deeper into Fae the elven witch's apprentice and there endless struggle to recover their lost spell book from Earthen Lands without drawing any attention to themselves because this is strictly forbidden by the Elven Elders.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story continues into another world and there are many twists and turns for Fae the Elven Girl and the Witch named Ellen that would have Fae be her apprentice to uncover. The imperial guard of the nearby capital city may prove difficult to avoid. It details the rise of a Wyvern Wraith and the plight of a Witch Wraith.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis Game is an RPG Game and its game play is like WOW in that the game has levels of gear and it also has great graphical terrains of desert scenes and beach scenes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is still in development. The Objectives still need to be implemented.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis has an advanced inventory and it saves progress this is the completed inventory. The 2nd partial inventory will be adapted over time as the code needs to be coded for each individual object and this takes time. Some are coded in this edition and some are not yet implemented. Inventory &amp; Quests keys: J,K,I. Horse Mount Keys: F.<br />\r\nCamera: F1,F2,F3. Keys may differ from Mac to Windows Versions. Q. Dragon Fly/Take off. Use 'E' To interact with NPC's.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe RPG Game(Elven Magic 2) is coded with Effects working on most builds and allows for the attack, these effects will have relied on without the use of weapons at this stage as melee combat will be introduced later without the use of guns specifically as a weapon. As the game's storyline will not involve guns for the attack of any humanoids, only creatures will be attacked using guns which will not be implemented like a weapon at all, only in the inventory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nElven Magic FPS is available for prepurchase and at this stage, you can attack and the Inventory works as well as a character sheet and crafting functioning is coming soon as recipes need to be added. You can also ride a horse on the beach in one scene. Things like purchasing of equipment will be added in time, if there is any please don't purchase anything in-game due to weather saving functionality works you can buy the game still as it is in beta not everything is working.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis Main Game (ElvenMagicPro) is not Required to load and play Elven Magic 2 and Elven Magic SE which are working well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease Purchase as a bundle as this is the cheapest way at this stage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrices may change without prior notice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game can be implemented with over 30GB of content at this stage each build takes only 2.5GB.",
