When it seems that we’re condemned to spend the rest of our days there, Dr. Novichiva -an alternative version of Dr. Ivanovich- shows up through a space-time breach, holding us responsible for the greatest threat the multiverse has ever faced.<br><br>Our constant back and forth through space-time has altered the infinite parallel realities, whose very existence we ignored. As a consequence, in a high percentage of these multiverses, Hitler not only won World War II, but has ended up expanding his power to the farthest reaches of the galaxy. The allied resistance in universe C-139, commanded by dr. Novichiva, has managed to eliminate thousands of versions of Hitler in their respective multiverses, but some of them are still on the warpath.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1508280/extras/3f3ce67c3a832a1aa77c69bb5a8964b1.poster.avif?t=1643911456\" width=640 height=360 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1508280/extras/3f3ce67c3a832a1aa77c69bb5a8964b1.webm?t=1643911456\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1508280/extras/3f3ce67c3a832a1aa77c69bb5a8964b1.mp4?t=1643911456\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >FEATURES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 13 story-mode levels filled with humor.<br></li><li> Manipulate the environment: Hit, grab, move, shoot, ...
