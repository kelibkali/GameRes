Improve your skill in single-player or compete with other players in multi-player mode.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Non-linear levels - try to find best path, that suits you most.<br></li><li> Physics-based jumping - you can't alter your velocity once mid-air. You have to plan ahead.<br></li><li> Different materials - object's surface affects movement, like friction or bounciness.<br></li><li> Singleplayer mode - complete levels as quickly as you can.<br></li><li> Multiplayer mode - compete against each other or form teams for more tactical gameplay.<br></li><li> Different game modes - adjust rules for best experience.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Level structure</h2>There's no obvious path to follow. You have to search map for checkpoints and find route to them. Some areas are harder to reach than others. Moreover, overall level difficulties differ significantly.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Multiplayer</h2>Play with strangers or create private server and invite your friends to join you. You can play against each other or form teams. Teams allow more tactical gameplay, when you share tasks between team members.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Different game modes</h2>You can play with limited on unlimited time. In case of unlimited time, game ends when all checkpoints are captured. You can also decide whether checkpoints may be overtaken by other players - this leads to more competitive and likely longer game.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1679490/extras/627a838779cd2e21e71b19a0496db3be.poster.avif?t=1670106489\" width=616 height=280 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1679490/extras/627a838779cd2e21e71b19a0496db3be.webm?t=1670106489\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1679490/extras/627a838779cd2e21e71b19a0496db3be.mp4?t=1670106489\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
