    "description": "In this adventure we will embody Jim, a young thief, who discovers that the expedition that is being organized in the port of Bristol, apparently to discover a new continent, has the real purpose of finding the treasure of the pirate Frink, who is said is hidden in the legendary &quot;Alcachofa Island&quot;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJim must get a position in that crew, collaborate on a riot, get to &quot;Alcachofa Island&quot; and seize the treasure, bypassing traps, riddles, and fighting Dick, the champion pirate, who also intends to seize the treasure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGraphically we uncheck the latest 3D trends and look for an aesthetic close to classic cartoons to be consistent with a story like this. We find a point &amp; click graphic adventure with hand-painted backgrounds, bright colors and characters with a high percentage of purples who are the visual representation of the &quot;Alcachofa Island&quot; environment.",
