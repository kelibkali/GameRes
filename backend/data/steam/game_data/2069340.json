The game takes place in a Y2K apocalypse, where all the technology has revolted against humanity and wiped out most of the population.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCraft weapons, listen to some killer tunes, and look awesome all while fighting enemies to get to the Kaiju's horn and destroy it. Build your COMBO by doing different skating tricks, grating you additional abilities and making your weapons even more powerful. The game features over 150 weapon combinations, so you can find exactly what feels right for you to destroy the K.A.I.J.U.!",
