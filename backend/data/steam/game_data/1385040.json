In a past life you learned how to make bread. Taking your trusty wagon with you and your knowledge of making bread, you travel around selling to the monsters you once fought as a hero. The problem? You can only seem to stay awake long enough to bake 5 good loaves a day.<br><br>Monsters from far and wide hear of your amazing (almost burnt) bread and flock to you to buy. You let the poor, brainless foes purchase your less-than delicious bread and then knock them out using the skulls of your past enemies to win back the bread they bought.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Demo Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Six playable levels</li><li><br></li><li>Two unlockable Bakers</li><li><br></li><li>Three unlockable color palettes</li><li></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Full Version Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Five different zones.</strong> There's a total of 50+ levels across all zones to complete on your journey to retirement, each zone having their own aesthetics.<br></li><li><strong>Many different types of enemies.</strong> Some just want your bread, but others have special traits to alter the action.<br></li><li><strong>Special Trinkets.</strong> Cute little trinkets are available to purchase with your hard earned coin.
