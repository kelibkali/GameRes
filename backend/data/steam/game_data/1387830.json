    "description": "Joseph is a bank robber who during the escape is involved in a fatal accident. Now he wakes up in a place that looks like the same city but it is actually of a kind of limbo in which Joseph will have to turn into a warrior to face your worst feelings and sins, and receive a second chance.<br />\r\nGetting to the end is practically impossible.<br />\r\nUsing only one sword and needing a lot of skill, the player will need to survive 25 waves to be worthy of a second chance to live in the world of mortals.<br />\r\nHate Wave is a mix of the gameplay and difficulty of Dark Souls and the wave mode of Call of Duty.<br />\r\nWith realistic graphics, the player will face several monsters with different skills and artificial intelligence difficult to decipher which his next move.<br />\r\nFew will reach the end, but whoever succeeds will be properly rewarded.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is aimed at raising funds to create a much larger and more professional project. All players who manage to reach the end of Hate Wave will receive a free access key for our next project.",
