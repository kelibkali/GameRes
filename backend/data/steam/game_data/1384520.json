In the first Part of Woods you have the seemingly easy task of simply keeping a fire going, and protecting yourself from the cold in winter. Chop wood, feed the fire, and survive. A simple task at first, but once Winter wanes, the challenge is increased as David will have to learn to fish, make traps to catch small animals, and eventually learn to hunt to survive. Along the way, learn about Davids story from his past and why he must survive.<br><br>In the Woods there are no heroes. Just you, the elements, and the will to survive.",
