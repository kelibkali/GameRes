He has all the eggs a digital water fowl could ever want. He ROLLS in eggs. He might have &quot;A DEPENDENCY ISSUE&quot; with eggs.<br><br>What sucks about this is that the dreaded GEESE GANG is totally hating on him because they are garbage - and I mean, if you really think about it, no one ever goes &quot;aw, look at that cute goose over there&quot;. The Geese are aware of that: it makes them unstable.<br><br>Long story short, they want DUCKSTER'S eggs but he's not going to let it happen, because like I said earlier he might have a dependency issue with the eggs.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Collect eggs in a variety of extreme and overwhelming game modes, cool?</h2></strong><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/500340/extras/c0fefc3fa3cfcac0752a3ca1bcd41bfc.avif?t=1579909811\" width=436 height=224 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >This game is <strong>hard</strong> so get used to it you puppies</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/500340/extras/ee749913986265db6b8041f3808eb87f.avif?t=1579909811\" width=562 height=152 /></span><br><br>This game is hard, just like DUCKSTER's life.<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br><i>QUACK ATTACK 1985: TURBO DX EDITION is part of the ATTACK PACK, which also includes SOS and THE GREY MAN!
