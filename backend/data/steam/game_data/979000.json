In their quest for power, some scholar wizards started to study odd artifacts called orbs that could focus the elemental magic around them. After a series of experiments ending in quite impressive magic explosions, the scholar realized the orbs where too unstable. The novice wizards, who were quite bored in their magic studies, had different conclusions: one, those orbs would make quite a show as weapons, and two, we need a magic fight club!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/979000/extras/f4097ad876be0b486281e380c7c20cb0.avif?t=1564667096\" width=616 height=70 /></span><br><br>Face off your friends in battles up to 4 players (humans or bots) either alone or as a team.<br>Navigate your way through the arena, trap your enemies with magic infused exploding orbs while outsmarting them, gather power-ups to lay more orbs and give them greater reach, use your dash to avoid danger or surprise your opponents and exploit everything the arena gives you, like the way your orbs explode, your elemental spell and even some environmental hazards!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Gameplay easy to learn, rich and fast-paced.<br></li><li>1 to 4 players in free for all or team versus team.<br></li><li>4 game modes :<br><br>        ◦ <strong>Sudden death:</strong> You’ve got one life and there can only be one survivor.
