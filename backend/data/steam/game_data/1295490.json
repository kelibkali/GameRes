    "description": "Beyond DAWN is set in a dystopian universe where the struggle over resources has created a society obsessed by energy usage, all controlled by the secretive D.A.W.N corporation. As the main character Chance, a brash young cadet in the D.A.W.N Field Reconnaissance Corps. Your mission will lead you on a journey that explores the world around you, and you will learn about the different factions that are struggling for the control and fate of their society. As the energy of the planet is running out you will have to choose sides and allies in the struggle between D.A.W.N and the Rebels, fighting for the right to self control…<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeyond DAWN is an old school JRPG passion project by creators Marcus Allard and Fredrik Öberg with a heavy focus on story, characters and original music over gameplay gimmicks. We have created the kind of game that we ourselves would like to play. Our game is 100% free, and if you enjoyed it and would like to help us finish the story, you may support us through our Patreon.",
