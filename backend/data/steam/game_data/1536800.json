This limits access to certain techniques, saddles, and the dragon cave.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDragon Creek is a dragon training game where every dragon is procedurally generated. Enter in a code at the shrine, and see what dragon it makes!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDragons need constant care. You will need to feed them, wash them, make sure they are inside when they go to sleep, give them medicine when they get sick, and pet them when they get stressed out. Dragons have different preferences and needs based on their personality and breed. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDragons can also compete in battle tournaments.
