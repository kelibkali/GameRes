    "description": "The Shadow Government Simulator is a turn based strategy game that puts you in control of a shadow organization dead set on global domination via bribery, intimidation, seduction, and any means necessary. Inspired by old classics like Plague Inc. and modern gems like The Shrouded Isle, this is a challenging game where you infiltrate nations, discover their networks of power, and then reshape them to fit your agenda.<br><br>The Original Soundtrack, composed by Michael Hoffmann, captures the game’s world of conspiracy, secrecy, and world domination between various secret societies. Filled with foreboding tones, escalating tension, and triumphant fanfares, the music sets the stage for the player to execute their master plan.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1691410/extras/ebb4dcdcec352a05b1148e4549fe40e4.poster.avif?t=1667570594\" width=616 height=346 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1691410/extras/ebb4dcdcec352a05b1148e4549fe40e4.webm?t=1667570594\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1691410/extras/ebb4dcdcec352a05b1148e4549fe40e4.mp4?t=1667570594\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Turn-based strategic infiltration</h2><br>In Puppet Master every action you take matters on a global scale.

The world’s countries will unite against you and you will face off against rival organizations. Choose wisely which region to infiltrate first, as they will provide different bonuses, but also present different challenges. Each region will offer a distinct play experience with its procedurally generated networks. As time moves forward the regions will acquire unique modifiers to increase the difficulty and diversity of the maps you play on. It might well be worth the risk, however, as nations you take over become yours to command, unlocking new powerful abilities. Be it a person or a country, they shall all become like pawns before you! <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1691410/extras/0feaddffdb0c5060d14aff00fb0a0fdd.poster.avif?t=1667570594\" width=616 height=348 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1691410/extras/0feaddffdb0c5060d14aff00fb0a0fdd.webm?t=1667570594\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1691410/extras/0feaddffdb0c5060d14aff00fb0a0fdd.mp4?t=1667570594\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
