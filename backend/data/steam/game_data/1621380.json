    "description": "Scampr is an open-world game set in a quaint rural hamlet invented by aliens to replicate life on Earth as remembered by a goldfish. The goldfish may have misremembered some facts about how the Earth works, and whales fly through the air and acorns turn into miniature giraffes. And all that would be fine except that the goldfish is lost, and needs to be set free while you activate the animals (by throwing acorns at them.)<br />\r\nLuckily, you are a squirrel so this is just the job for you. <br />\r\nGet some acorns. Run up a tree. Run along a fence. Deactivate forcefields. Ride a whale (or two!) Visit the nighttime world. Experience an underwater laboratory. See the artifacts of ancient civilizations. And all that would be fine except that the goldfish is lost and needs to be set free, and the animals need to be activated",
