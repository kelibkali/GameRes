    "description": "In Project Wingman, the player is a mercenary pilot, fighting an uphill battle against the modern military juggernaut of the imperial Federation. Over a cracked and scorched world, the sounds of modern warfare and combat aircraft clashing are scored to Jose Pavli's orchestral-modern-fantasy soundtrack. From plucky string movements to the scream of organs, Project Wingman's soundtrack plays homage to the best of the combat flight action genre, while striking its own flavor in its gameplay-supporting rhythms and swells.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nARTIST:\t        Jose Pavli<br />\r\nCOMPOSER:\tJose Pavli",
