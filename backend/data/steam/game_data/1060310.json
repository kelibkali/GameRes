    "description": "Great Toilet Simulator is a first-person indie horror telling you the story of a man who has his car broken on his way home, in the middle of a thick forest. What makes the situation even worse is that the main character is really in need of a toilet. However, he doesn’t know yet that a dangerous creature lives in that forest. And when he realizes that, he will try to find a toilet even faster because he can also hide himself from the monster there.",
