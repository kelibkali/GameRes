Do you want to kill the final boss with a level 1 character? You can!<br></li><li>New Chat and NPC system that'll have you piecing together the lore and backstory of the world with what you get out of the people you meet. If they know about it, and feel like telling you, of course.<br></li><li>Your choices truly affect the story, determining not only what ending you get, but also how the adventure itself plays out, with exclusive party members, bosses, challenges, etc.<br></li><li>Over 40 enemies, including 15+ bosses, to battle! No enemy feels the same, as they all have their own attacks, spells, abilities, special attributes and even AI. Not even the recolors fight the same!<br></li><li>60 different Spells and over 45 special Artifacts to collect! Spells and Weapons are all equally powerful, and there's no weakness system, so use what you like best and is better suited for the situation.<br></li><li>More than 10 dungeons, some being completely optional.<br></li><li>4 party members, each with their own abilities, spells, weapons and dialogue. Some of them can even leave you based on what you do throughout your adventure.<br></li><li>3 different endings with variations based on what you did and who's with you when the journey's over.<br></li><li>New Game Plus, with increased difficulty, that keeps everything you obtained from your previous adventure, letting you choose a different story path to take and granting access to new areas.</li></ul><br><i>We're a very small team of passionate creators, and we hope you enjoy our dream project. Thanks a lot!</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >TRADING CARDS ARE READY FOR WHEN STEAM ALLOWS THEM!</h2>",
