    "description": "A tactical combined arms warfare game promoting deep cooperation between players, amplified by the use of positional VOIP and features designed to help teammates share situational awareness. Squad and role organization that ensures that individual players and small groups have a unique way to contribute to the overall team effort. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1342400/extras/12de6508cb2cb13f86c024c2833a340b.poster.avif?t=1704482113\" width=680 height=133 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1342400/extras/12de6508cb2cb13f86c024c2833a340b.webm?t=1704482113\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>Each 60-player team is segmented into squads, which can further specialize towards infantry, logistics or armor. Both factions or teams have a Commander, who is responsible for coordinating squads toward the team objectives. The Commander makes resources available to the team in a mix that shapes the particular tactics a team will use to reach the victory condition. These come in the form of vehicles, equipment or off-map support. It will be essential for the Commander and squads to remain coordinated as the team's ability to maintain their position and resources within the game is utterly dependent on the level of communication between players.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1342400/extras/c3be3a71e31ad916d5b1a14f7d9469eb.poster.avif?t=1704482113\" width=680 height=133 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1342400/extras/c3be3a71e31ad916d5b1a14f7d9469eb.webm?t=1704482113\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>Each squad is further segmented into roles, including the Squad Leader and individual specializations such as Medic, Combat Engineer, Machine Gunner, and even Anti-Tank.
