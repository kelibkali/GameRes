    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Meanders Map Pack: Area 51</h2>This 24 Terrain Map Packs features a mix of maps that allows you to launch (or stop) a full-scale alien invasion with a selection of maps for the Aliens and the Allied Forces that stop them. Begin your adventure by slowly over-running a Colony from a quiet abandoned base into a full blown xeno nightmare, gain the attention of Area 51 with all of the Black Ops styled maps such as Containment, Quarantine, Specimen Analysis, Embassy Offices, Armory and Craft Observation rooms to make preparations for an assault - then enter the Quantum Teleporter and take the battle for supremacy to the Alien Mothership with its own sophisticated technology and defenses. Will you head for the Command Centre or the Reactor Core? Will you make it through the Acidic Hives, learn precious intel from the Archives, accidentally launch a full-scale counter-attack either by air or by ground via the Aliens own Transportals - or will you be caught and interrogated in the Aliens Prison? Alternately - start from the Mothership and work backward to infiltrate or invade an unsuspecting colony and its overlords.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>1 x Quantum Teleporter<br></li><li>1 x Alien Transportal<br></li><li>2 x Armories<br></li><li>1 x Prison &amp; Interrogation Room<br></li><li>1 x Alien Archives<br></li><li>1 x Alien Launch Bay<br></li><li>2 x Alien Command Centres<br></li><li>1 x Queen Hive Biomass<br></li><li>2 x Acidic Egg Biomass Sectors<br></li><li>2 x Abandoned Colony Base<br></li><li>2 x Overrun Colony Base<br></li><li>1 x Reactor Core<br></li><li>2 x Specimen Dissection<br></li><li>1 x Observation and Cold Storage<br></li><li>1 x Customs and Detention<br></li><li>1 x UFO Containment<br></li><li>1 x Briefing Rooms<br></li><li>1 x Species Containment</li></ul>Maps are sized specially for FG at 1350x900 and under 500 kb each to help prevent slow-down during play.
