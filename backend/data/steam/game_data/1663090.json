The unfortunate Poe made a deal with the god of poetry, Bragi and now at the age of 31, payment has no come due. Wrought with the pain of such an early departure, thinking about what he’d be leaving behind, not his wife, Virginia, but his literary genius that he had now been reminded was not of his own creations but the god turned muse that he’s made this deal with.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayer’s battle through the worlds of Edgar Allan Poe’s creations, fighting hordes of monsters, demons, even poets of a time since past.
