If the volume is too low then it will automatically increases it, on the other hand if the sound is too loud then it will decrease it. The best thing is, you don't have to do anything!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1443900/extras/e199a1a70fb6854ec8a45cff91fdd9d2.poster.avif?t=1632423626\" width=360 height=340 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1443900/extras/e199a1a70fb6854ec8a45cff91fdd9d2.webm?t=1632423626\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1443900/extras/e199a1a70fb6854ec8a45cff91fdd9d2.mp4?t=1632423626\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>With its many customization options, you are certain to find the right setting for you.
