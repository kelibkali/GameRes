Dancers are nimble; sailors are good swimmers. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Some characters are prone to depression; some, to self-doubt.

Let their friends fall in battle, and they may become depressed. Let morale fall too low, and you’ll risk resentment and desertion. Keep them happy, however, and they will grow close to one another, form fond memories, give nicknames–even share their combat skills!
