Destroy obstacles, solve puzzles, and move around at crazy speeds. The main game is a mix of Action and Puzzle gameplay, offering a satisfying challenge, without being too difficult. See how your Rifts interact with other advanced technologies, such as: Anti-gravity, laser beams, rocket launchers, gravity shields, energy orbs and robotic soldiers.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/906470/extras/cdfd760f9bf699097e19f5feb4c7dc5a.avif?t=1769107802\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/906470/extras_big/cdfd760f9bf699097e19f5feb4c7dc5a.avif?t=1769107802 width=800 height=450 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>&quot;Story Mode&quot;</strong> features a fully voiced cast of characters.
