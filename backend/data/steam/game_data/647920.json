    "description": "This DLC contains Balthazar's Dream soundtrack in mp3 format composed by Taylor Ambrosio Wood along with a pdf with concept arts and other art from the game and a wallpaper.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWord from our composer:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;To convey Balthazar's dream world through music, I wanted to use instruments and textures you wouldn’t normally hear together. Toy piano with mbira, hang drum, marimba, voices, metallic percussion, udu, frame drums, synths overlaid with strings, and many other unusual sounds. I also played a lot with how tuning affects our perception of music by using 'out-of-tune' instruments interlocked with those in standard Western-tuning. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe combination of de-tuned instruments, unusual textures, and cyclical interlocking patterns create a sensation that things within this sonic world are not quite right… &quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrack list:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1. The Accident 01:05<br />\r\n2. Main Titles 02:16<br />\r\n3. Following Dustin 02:26<br />\r\n4. Linux The Furious Cat-astrophy 01:04<br />\r\n5. The Dream Forest 02:23<br />\r\n6.
