    "description": "Neon Aileron is a retro-style shooter where enemies spawn to the beat of the music.  Neon Aileron was created to evoke memories of playing older shooters that pre-date the bullet-hell genre.  We call this bullet-lite, because the focus is on shooting enemies instead of dodging complex bullet patterns.  Neon Aileron is great for players who are new to the shoot 'em up genre or those who haven't a played a horizontal shooter in a while.  The forgiving damage system and multiple difficulty levels allow the game to scale to the player's skill level.  Switch to the Hard difficulty when you are ready for more of a challenge.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Bullet-Lite Shoot 'Em Up - Spend more time shooting, less time dodging.<br></li><li>Beginner Friendly - Easy and Normal difficulties are available for entry-level players looking for a fun playthrough.  Switch to Hard difficulty for an extra challenge.<br></li><li>Leaderboards - All-Time and monthly leaderboards are available.  Challenge friends to see who can get the highest score this month!<br></li><li>Quick Arcade-Style Gameplay - A full game of Neon Aileron can be played in about 30 minutes, just like old-school arcade games.<br></li><li>Synchronized Soundtrack - This game features a custom synth soundtrack by Von Hertzog.
