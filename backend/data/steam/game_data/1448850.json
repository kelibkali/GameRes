    "description": "In a cabin in the woods, his girlfriend is possessed by The Book of the Dead (or &quot;Necronomicon&quot;) that summons monsters in the mist that come in increasingly creepy waves. Will you be able to survive this retro battle against evil that mixes top-down action-rpg with arcade?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou must protect the Book of the Dead from the hordes of Evil that come from the forest to invade the cabin. If they take this Grimoire of Darkness to their Master, then it will be Game Over for you, your girlfriend and the whole world.  Hang in there until dawn!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut do not worry, like a horror movie from the 80s, in this retro arcade game you'll have the help of melee weapons, stylish guns, insane magic items, an uncontrolled chainsaw and much more!",
