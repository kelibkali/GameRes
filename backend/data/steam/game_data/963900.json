    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Chromatic Aberration</h2><br>A single-player, action orientated, Pixel-Art shooter. With fast combat, bullet-hell enemies and satisfying weapons! With a mix of 2D and 3D, Chromatic Aberration is inspired by Doom, Duke3D and Megaman. Influenced by an age where there was no &quot;First Person Shooter&quot;, there were the &quot;Doom clones&quot;.<br><br>Enter a dark, violent struggle between resistance forces and the AI governor ruling the city! Face off against cyborgs, machines, mutants and worse! From the neon-lit Malice City, to the barren wastelands, to the arctic labs. Fight across multiple locales, against numerous aggressive enemies.<br><br>I hope you enjoy!",
