    "description": "Chase is a fast-paced competitive party game, perfect for any party occasion. With a missile that can kill you in a split second you must use your skills to avoid, out-play and react fast to win over your friends.   <br />\r\n<br />\r\nInspired from the Warcraft 3 mod “Hungry Hungry Felhounds” one player gets the tracker and tries to not get hit by the missile. You can shoot the tracker into other players to get the missile to chase them, but if you keep the tracker and survive, your next shot will be empowered, making It harder for your target to evade. You can also use powerups to get an edge over the other players.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nChase can be played online with other players, or offline with your friends on the couch, or a mix of the two! You start by customizing yourself from the different ships available, then choose from 3 different maps, 4 different game modes, and the game starts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne player is selected randomly at the start of the game and gets the tracker, the game starts and all you need to do, is be the last man standing, three times. The missile is the only way you can die, so watch out for it. It chases the player who last had the tracker in his possession, so if you shoot and miss, it’s still on you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThrow the tracker and hit other players to send the missile flying towards them, but if you are fast enough, you can dash out of the way and use one of the three powerups.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe shield makes you invulnerable for short period of time, while giving you the ability to bump into other players, messing with their predictions of the missile’s movement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing the black hole powerup can be devastating, pulling together 2 or 3 opponents at once grants an easy win, and bragging rights for the foreseeable future.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the black hole is cool, the pulse bomb is perhaps even better when used correctly. Use it to shoot the missile into another player, or vice versa, and make some truly amazing plays.",
