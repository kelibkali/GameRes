The game-play emphasize fast-paced action remnant to that of classic shooters. Players will face multiple enemies, objectives and challenges through multiple levels set over four distinctive environments and each level features at least one unique boss encounter. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Back Story</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/660890/extras/e4449af5d7656d5a7eae47b583460ab3.avif?t=1732913882\" width=660 height=200 /></span>In ancient times the foundations of civilization were seeded by the guild of Magus. Scholars of the guild, known as the wizards of Magus, studied the arcane of magic in the fields of alchemy, astronomy and astrology. Only through decades of study could the most devoted wizards master the arts of magic. These masters were called the Sortiari. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Wizards casted spells that would both aid in the advancement of civilization as well as unleash massive destruction upon ancient battlefields. Wielding such power however came at a great personal cost. Casting magic would rapidly drain the user's life force causing accelerated ageing. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Frustrated by his own dwindling live force, a Sortiari known as Kronos turned to forbidden techniques to gain immortality. Freed from the shackles of time Kronos indulged in magic to a dangerous extent and became consumed by an ever growing desire to shape the world to his every whim. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >For centuries Kronos plagued the ancient world turning all manner of creatures into monstrous beings.

Hyperspace drives create rifts through time-space allowing access to a time altered dimension known as hyperspace allowing for faster than light travel. Together with advanced cryopreservation techniques, this gave rise to a new era of deep space exploration. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >It was however discovered that the cryostasis procedures that deep space astronauts were subjected to caused severe mental stress. Combined with the extended periods of isolation associated with deep space travel this led to a massive rise in incidents associated with dementia and other mental afflictions. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >In order to maintain safety aboard deep-space vessels, a new advanced type of artificially intelligent android was developed.

Each time a hyperspace drive creates a rift through time-space it triggers an anomaly within  Kronos’s time sphere.

As the hyperspace drive opens a time rift in order to drop from hyperspace Kronos senses this anomaly and casts his dimensional alignment spell. As the Phlegethon emerges from hyperspace the dimensional alignment spell bends time and space and the ship collides with Kronos’s time sphere. The ship’s control systems are heavily damaged by the impact, and the crew awake from cryostasis to find that only the basic life support systems are active.
