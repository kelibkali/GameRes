Evade a missile by enabling a wall in front of it, or avoid a dangerous spike by disabling its color. Your active color can be swapped at any time to accomplish all sorts of tasks. This core mechanic is the founding principle for Spectrum. All other factors, levels, secrets, and interactions are designed around proper and creative use of your colors.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1247870/extras/a718a92b31b8440397377e2df26bf598.poster.avif?t=1639933165\" width=600 height=308 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1247870/extras/a718a92b31b8440397377e2df26bf598.webm?t=1639933165\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1247870/extras/a718a92b31b8440397377e2df26bf598.mp4?t=1639933165\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Platforming in Spectrum is crafted to be precise and intuitive. It's necessary to keep momentum and make narrow, intentional jumps. Spectrum has systems in place to help make fluid movement easier, but still intricate and satisfying. Mis-inputs and buggy movement are a thing of the past; the only skill cap in Spectrum is the player's ability. Many other mechanics are thrown into the mix to make the base movement fresh and interesting as progression and mastery continues.<br><br>Furthermore, Spectrum features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>100+ hand crafted levels to conquer and explore<br></li><li>5 main colors to unlock<br></li><li>8 sectors of 'campaign' levels<br></li><li>Sectors of hidden optional levels<br></li><li>A multitude of secrets hidden all over the place<br></li><li>And a crown for the king of the Spectrum, in addition to other cosmetics</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1247870/extras/f9f205f1ace67d1b4d5903977d5ac667.poster.avif?t=1639933165\" width=600 height=360 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1247870/extras/f9f205f1ace67d1b4d5903977d5ac667.webm?t=1639933165\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1247870/extras/f9f205f1ace67d1b4d5903977d5ac667.mp4?t=1639933165\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>To finish things out, here's what Spectrum <strong><u>doesn't feature:</u></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Floaty movement<br></li><li>A deep story with many characters<br></li><li>Lootboxes<br></li><li>Quick-time events<br></li><li>Water levels<br></li><li>A 100-player battle royale mode</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1247870/extras/199532c77b3e6702e1fd33099014bdd7.avif?t=1639933165\" width=750 height=100 /></span>",
