Just send them a link and they can join on their phone, or any device with a modern web browser. Start up At The Party, jump into a party with friends, and you can play any game DLC that anyone in the party owns (the game is free to play so your friends can play without buying the game DLC).<br><br>If you are all in the same room, you can set up a TV, laptop or other screen for everyone to see as well. If you are in separate places, don't worry, you don't need to stream the game (but you can if you want!)—anyone can load up their own spectator view, or just play using only one screen.<br><br>You can play At The Party directly on Steam, but also through the website atthe.party, so you can easily play from your phone or any other device with a modern web browser. If you play on the web, remember to sign in with Steam so you can play the games you own!",
