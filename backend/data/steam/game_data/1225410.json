    "description": "<strong>Why Neon Lights Again?</strong> is a nostalgic cyberpunk shooting gallery to play with a friend or on your own. Shoot bad guys and level bosses with different weapons, fly on cars, see how story is revealed in a comic book style<br><br>In the distant future citizens of Asgard witness strange series of events. Something is in the air and it's not just neon lights and rain (it often rains here actually). Frey(r) finds himself in an unknown street. It's raining (of course!) but what is more troubling is a group of street gangs pointing guns at Frey!<br>What is going to happen? Would this involve flying cars? For Sure!<br><br><strong>Key features:</strong><br>- retro/nostalgic cuberpunk feel and a lot of easter eggs, throwback to 80-90's (would be interesting to play with friend or family)<br>- hot seat mode: play with a friend like back in the days, combine various weapons and skills, compete who gets the best high score<br>- interesting story mode (with plot shown in comic book style) and fun survival mode (get the highest score!)",
