But if you adopt one, you'll soon find out how little this pawed predator has in common with a rodent. As cuddly as they come, it'll lick your face, and you'll discover that no, Ratchams are not completely lacking in hair. They feed off Ecaflee souls living in the Ecaflipus dimension, their favourite area.<br><br>- LUMINO SIDEKICK (HEALING):<br>If you take it upon yourself to restore lost harmony and re-establish order in the Krosmoz, you'd better hope you've got the charisma to pull it off! Leader of the Multimen, Lumino is always there to care for his brothers and allies whenever they get a booboo. Defender of all who are weak, oppressed and in need, he's as bright and lively as he is generous. In fact, the only thing wrong with Lumino, the only dark stain on his dazzling character sketch, is his brother Shadow...<br><br>This item allows you to summon Lumino, a Sidekick that will fight by your side during battle. He will heal you but can also prevent damage. A choice ally for those who prefer to head straight into mêlée!  <br><br>- BITTER SHIGEKAX:<br>Rediscover the flavour of bygone days with this traditionally made candy, which will increase Wisdom (EXP.) by 100 points for 30 fights.<br><br>- MOVIE SET MYSTERY BOX: <br>You dream of Kriss Krass or Bakara...
