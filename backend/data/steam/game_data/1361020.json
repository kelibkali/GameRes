    "description": "Fire up the Chainsaw. Just because you're dead doesn't mean anything is over, let alone the killing. Massacre and loot your way through this shifting woodland Nightmare, grow in power and improve your tactics, and maybe, if you can reach all six Carrion Shrines and slay every horrible thing that crawls out of the shadows to stop you, you might just make it back to life. You might even get your revenge. Just know that a wrong move will be your end. Again. For now.<br><br>It's a harsh Nightmare. You know what they say—if at first you don't escape, die, die again. <br><br>Living the Nightmare is a difficult Horror Roguelike with fast-paced, turn-based gameplay, random and procedural generation, loot and monsters galore, all made entirely by a team of two. <br><br><strong>MAIN FEATURES</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>A Turn-Based, Hex-Grid, Strategic, Difficult, Horror Roguelike</strong> where death is one misstep away. Being turn-based doesn't mean the action is slow. Commands play out as quickly as you input them. Monsters come in packs, but take their turns all at once. Nonetheless, if you want to think about your actions carefully, you have all the time in the world. Death is very patient and a painful Reconstitution is just a click away. <br></li><li> <strong>Scavenge, Survive, and Improve</strong> as you rip equipment, ammo, and hearts from the carcasses of your foes. You can find and wield 70 weapons, masks and items. You can also build your own Faceless and try different tactics utilizing over 40 perks. <br></li><li> <strong>A Shifting Nightmare</strong> made with a mix of random and procedural generation, featuring multiple biomes and a host of over 50 bosses and monsters with a multitude of mechanics to learn. <br></li><li> <strong>Streamlined Control</strong> makes the game intuitive and playable with just the mouse, freeing aspiring Killers to focus on slaughter and survival. Even loot is collected automatically.<br></li><li> <strong>Dive Right In</strong> with a short intro/tutorial and get right to the killing. Easy to learn, hard to master is definitely the right phrase, and there is a retro styled in-game Manual for players who want a deeper understanding of the game mechanics. </li></ul>",
