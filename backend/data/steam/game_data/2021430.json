    "description": "White The Hero's Return is a pixelated and really hardcore RPG inspired by indie games (like Undertale, Ib, Omori, Off, Oneshot, Everhood ...). It tells the story of a world ruled by a false king who is secretely working on something. Each character has a buried past and can become your friend as well as your enemy. Your path will be strewn with traps, enemies, bosses but above all puzzles, all lot of puzzles ! So are you up to it? There's only one way to find out!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe combat system is based on the principle of QTE, but the game also finds plenty of alternatives to the gameplay in the trials, which are ubiquitous in the game, and the bosses, which are presented as phases of bullet hell. The game therefore appeals to both your reflexes and your cognitive abilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs an example, you can watch the trailer above.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is currently a Demo version of about 4 hours (or more depending on your skills) and is still under development.",
