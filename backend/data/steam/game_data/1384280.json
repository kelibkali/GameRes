    "description": "Just a basic puzzle solving/survival game. Kill zombies, have fun, get to the end without dying! Updated versions may include more weapons, extra chapters, and more.<br />\r\nMy Little Horror is made by one independent developer (and he likes it that way) with a very limited knowledge of coding. How did I make so many mechanics already with limited code knowledge ASSETS ME BOY!- They can help. I started this project about 2-3 months after the pandemic hit, I've been using unity for less than 6 months (at date of launch). Can a young man with aspirations to create a game that is fun, playable, and hopefully doesn't totally suck. Join me and find out as we journey the vast digital plane of ecstasy, also known as gaming. Assist me in finding bugs. Pitching ideas. Suggestions for changes.",
