    "description": "<i>Dearest Player,</i><br><br>I write to you regarding a life changing videogame opportunity. That opportunity being, Flailure! How will Flailure change your life you ask? It will motivate you to meet people and make friends, because Flailure has no single player and you will need those friends to play it. It helps that those friends can be anywhere in the world as Flailure's wacky, medieval physics can be replicated automatically over the World Wide Web via online multiplayer.<br><br>The wacky physics based combat will help you keep these newfound, lightly battered friends and cement your kinship with heartfelt memories (of bashing them with spiked flails). The chaotic nature and built-in catch up mechanics gives everyone a good shot at winning, making it easier to play with new players of all skill levels. And if you do manage to best your friends in combat, there is still glorious fun for them to be had, as dying has never felt so satisfying (or strange.)<br><br><i>Love,</i><br><br>Squid <i>from Squid Land</i><br><br>Ps. Controller recommend but not required.",
