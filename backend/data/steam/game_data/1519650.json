    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >“You learned to run from what you feel, and that's why you have nightmares. <br>To deny is to invite madness. To accept is to control.” </h2>(Megan Chance)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >  </h2><br>Haunted Nightmares is a top down game that puts you into nightmares in which you are hunted by „<strong>Shadows</strong>“.<br><br><strong>These nightmares are your personal labyrinth. You have to know them to escape them and wake up in a &quot;Fresh Bed&quot; - if you can find it ...<br>But to find this bed (in this labyrinth with locked doors, hidden keys and all the shadows behind you ...) is not enough:<br>You can only wake up there, if you find the &quot;<i><u>Three Orbs of Beautiful Memories</u></i>&quot;, hidden in these nightmares.</strong><br><br>If a &quot;shadow&quot; spots you, it will hunt you - it will not give up !<br>And no matter how many chase you, you have to find a way out of your nightmare.<br>Once discovered - no way to hide … So you have to run…<br><br><strong>And you will be discovered - as it always is in nightmares.</strong><br><br>The question is how well do you know your nightmares - your personal nightly labyrinth.<br><br>If you get to know your dreams, you will find a place to awaken peacefully.<br>Despite all the doors, hidden keys, wrong ways and sticky soil.<br><br><strong>Maybe it won't always be easy. But a mastered nightmare will never haunt you again.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > KEY ELEMENTS </h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Find the hidden &quot;Three Orbs of Beautiful Memories&quot; <br></li><li>Find the right keys for the right doors - don't open the wrong ones<br></li><li>And try desperately to get out of this nightmare - despite the ongoing haunting <br></li><li>Keep an eye on your stamina - you can't run forever<br></li><li>Keep an eye on your vitality - the &quot;shadows&quot; will try to steal it from you</li></ul>",
