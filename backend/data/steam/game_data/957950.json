Since its inception, only West Pakistan controlled the country's military, policy making, and economy. East Pakistan was merely treated as its colony. This created a rift that resulted in conflict of interests between leaders of both regions. <br>1970 was the year of political tensions between East and West Pakistan. Later that year, Awami League of East Pakistan led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman won the first democratic election of Pakistan. Despite gaining majority the League was not invited by the ruling military junta to form a government. The atrocities by the Armed Forces from West Pakistan against the people of East Pakistan kept increasing which led to civil unrest and genocide in the East. <br>By end of April 1971, millions of refugees started coming into India from East Pakistan causing diplomatic tensions in the Indian subcontinent. India decided to act on it and determined to liberate East Pakistan (Bangladesh) as an independent country. On 3rd of December 1971, Pakistan Air Force carried out pre-emptive attacks on northern Indian air bases. The war officially started on all fronts. <br>The Indian Navy carried out missions and created a Naval Blockade in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. The famed aircraft carrier of the Indian Navy INS Vikrant with her task force and air squadrons conducted lot of Maritime Interdiction Operations and sorties to completely paralyze the enemy in the East. The Western Naval Command of the Indian Navy targeted the Naval and commercial HQ of Pakistan in Karachi and conducted Operation Trident and Python. Many other events took place in both Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. <br>On 16th December 1971, Pakistan eventually signed the Instrument of Surrender and Bangladesh was declared an independent country. The scale of naval operations during 1971 war is considered to be the biggest since WWII. <br><br><strong>1971: Indian Naval Front will enable you to experience pretty much all the Indian Navy operations executed during the 1971 War. </strong>",
