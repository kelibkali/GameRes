His goal was to rule the world! However, after an unexpected fight, he was defeated by another magician named Sathenu.

Then he created an ancient organization to protect these relics, and two Artifacts for anyone to travel back in time, if the world is in crisis again. The Guardians of Time were the protectors of these relics. Then, thousands of years later into the future, Nrutas, an orphan, realizes his power. So he finds and uses one of these artifacts to travel back to the first relic location, the Medieval Era, within the Kingdom of Atheos!

These spells must be targeted by pointing your cursor to your target.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Melee attack</h2>This is a really unique feature we implemented. The feature itself is not really unique, because most of the MMORPGs have this feature, right? But, we made a little tweak, which makes the game more realistic, yet harder. You can use Melee attack by left clicking on your mouse, but if you are too far away from the target, you will miss! This being said, to use Melee attack you must be really close to your target so you can hit them. <br>There is also a cooldown system, after every hit you make, a bar in the bottom of the screen will show with a countdown. After you make a Melee attack against your target, you will have to wait a few seconds, depending on the weapon, to make your next Melee attack.",
