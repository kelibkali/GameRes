He's turned some pirates into dolphins. He's thrown a king or two into a cave. And now some other king in Thebes is talking smack. But none of that has cheered him up. It's the playwrights the kids listen to these days.<br><br>Mumble poets and people using automatons to speak their lines... he's sick of it. Back in his day the likes of Euripides could tear apart a stage and leave the crowd screaming for more. He's decided it's up to him to set things right.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1589960/extras/8a7bb23d13e3002cde01aa2f05b741b2.avif?t=1617140977\" width=616 height=141 /></span><br><br>The Frogs is a point-and-click adventure game based on the ancient Greek comedy by Aristophanes. It's a hodgepodge of ancient wit, Pythonesque animation, Renaissance artwork, and public domain classical music all wrapped up in a ball of irreverent humor from a mind way too influenced by the likes of Terry Practhett and Jasper Fforde.<br><br>Still out to sea aboard the Cleisthenes and having just read Andromeda, Dionysus is pumped and ready to get back to his theater in Athens so he can get to work improving the world of the arts for the good of everyone. But we all know it can't be that easy... he has to go through a lot of content to make it worth the asking price.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1589960/extras/065536ed8635bfaa9132b92a7f3af491.avif?t=1617140977\" width=616 height=138 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Innovative Point-and-Click Interface<br></li><li>Ancient Humor Circa 405 BCE<br></li><li>Choices That Matter<br></li><li>Multiple Solutions to Puzzles<br></li><li>Renaissance Artwork<br></li><li>Classical Music<br></li><li>Hidden Optional Content<br></li><li>Tons Of Interactive Elements and NPCs<br></li><li>References So Niche You'll Wonder Why I Bothered<br></li><li>Multiple Endings Whether Aristophanes Likes It Or Not<br></li><li>What's He Gonna Do?
