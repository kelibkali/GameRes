Manage your riders' races and career progression, build your team’s prestige and ride to victory in an infinitely-replayable board game representation of professional cycling.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1237070/extras/6f9e2bc57c9552a76c57e8f067549b64.poster.avif?t=1686090496\" width=614 height=132 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1237070/extras/6f9e2bc57c9552a76c57e8f067549b64.webm?t=1686090496\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1237070/extras/6f9e2bc57c9552a76c57e8f067549b64.mp4?t=1686090496\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Race - Your Decisions Matter</h2>The Cyclist: Tactics breaks with traditional sports management games, in that the racing itself is the focus of the gameplay, rather than a distraction. Guide your team through multi-day tours, gruelling classics and blisteringly fast time trials, while contending with challenging terrain. Use your team’s strengths to your advantage, and plan your strategy to offset their weaknesses. Realistic tactics are vital; use positioning within the field and slipstreaming to ensure your riders are in position to press your advantage when the time is right. Balance your riders’ resource use between keeping up with the field, versus making the big push for the win, while ensuring they aren’t exhausted for the next day’s stage!<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1237070/extras/390ba0caed4e412b539fb7f29b488d15.poster.avif?t=1686090496\" width=614 height=196 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1237070/extras/390ba0caed4e412b539fb7f29b488d15.webm?t=1686090496\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1237070/extras/390ba0caed4e412b539fb7f29b488d15.mp4?t=1686090496\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Career Mode - From Humble Beginnings, To The Top</h2>Start your rider in the amateur cycling circuit, building a team from local riders, and attracting a sponsor.

The Cyclist: Tactics uses intelligent procedural generation to create the stages upon which you race, allowing for nearly infinite and meaningful variation in landscape and terrain.  Use the flat smooth roads in a given stage to conserve your resources, or mount your charge over the rough cobbles while your opponents are forced to back off - playing your strengths off the game world is vital to success!",
