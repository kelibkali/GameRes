    "description": "Chess meets match-three to create a deep and strategic new experience. Faced with a board full of chess pieces, you must create rows or columns of matching pieces to score points. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPieces move the same way as in chess and “take” the piece in their target destination, clearing it from the board. Players can move three pieces each turn with scoring and cascades occurring at the end of the turn.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJust like chess, the key is thinking several steps ahead and high scores are only possible by lining up combos as pieces fall into the empty spaces you’ve created. Progress through the medieval estate to complete the game, mastering three types of level - game, puzzle and challenge.",
