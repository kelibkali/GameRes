This is a story from a quiet neighborhood, however, it contains immoral triangular relationship between the cops and the murderer.<br></li><li>Over 70 images and stills! PC-98-like pixel art visuals make dull suburbia colored melancholically.<br></li><li>Chillwave music (provided by Virtual Cat) makes you feel at ease. Summer time in the small town is becoming stylish as a city.</li></ul>",
