The game itself is pretty great in my biased opinion, and has provided some dedicated players hundreds of hours of gameplay, but there are some technical things I for one would want to know when buying a game:<br><br></li><li> MaD2 is an established web game being released here packaged with Adobe AIR due to web Flash end-of-life.<br></li><li> The resolution is a bit weird 1066x600 (16:9) due to being developed on the web. It can be upscaled and fullscreened at the cost of performance.<br></li><li> The game is locked to 60fps. It should be reachable with a decent system in a reasonable ragdoll-mutilating scenario, but since it is a sandbox game it is very possible to tank the fps by doing crazy sandbox stuff.<br></li><li> More detailed info about the technical stuff can be found in the FAQ.<br><strong>-rava</strong></li></ul>",
