    "description": "<strong>A COVID Stress Relief Experience </strong><br>Corona Kombat is part of a research program focused on the mental side effects of COVID19 and the lockdown and is used as part of treatment programs focused on COVID19 rehabilitation. The main focus is relief of stress.<br><br><strong>The game features two game modes:</strong><br>- Strengthen Willpower: A more intense game mode where you become 'game over' after 10 misses.<br>- Build Resistance:  Focused on relaxation while you enter your body to shoot at the virus.<br><br><strong>The Science</strong><br>Kombat is developed with experts in the field of psychology and gaming. Using a technique called ‘visualization’, shooting the Virus in your body could positively affect your stress levels. No claims that this does happen can be currently made, as the application is still part of a research program.<br><br>NOTE: This game is part of a health project. It is related to game mechanics where visualising a problem 'ingame' relates to ones psychological response to the issue in real life. The 'relaxed' game mode includes suggestions related to gaming and health. Corona Kombat is not intended to replace professional help.",
