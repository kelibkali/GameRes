    "description": "SYNSTASIS is a turn-based cyberpunk RPG with tactical elements, set in a post-libertarian future where governments have been deemed irrelevant and 90% of humanity live in megacities run entirely by corporations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story revolves around a group of scavengers of spare parts and machinery living in the underbelly of a megacity, and their unwitting entanglement in a plot that could determine the fate of 8 million people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game presents a futuristic world that spurs the imagination, while remaining logical and plausible, by incorporating several technologies and socio-economic concepts that are currently in development and which may become reality in the near-to-distant future.",
