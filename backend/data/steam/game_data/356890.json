I got everyone on the set hooked on it. It's a very easy game to learn, very hard game to master&quot;<br><strong>Burnie: Rooster Teeth (Podcast #302)</strong><br><br>&quot;It's finger crack!&quot;<br><strong>Game Stitch Podcast</strong><br><br>&quot;One More Line is viciousness without respite. A hardcore gaming experience&quot;<br><strong>PocketGamer</strong><br><br>&quot;An addictive time-waster perfect for downtime at the office or the daily commute&quot;<br><strong></strong><br><br>&quot;It's a twitchy arcade game that's something of a hybrid between the steering mechanic of slingshot racer and those rotating planet platformer games that are so darn popular.&quot;<br><strong></strong><br><br>&quot;SMG has got the formula precisely right. It's a fast, eye-catching game that's mechanically difficult, but the controls are simple and intuitive, so you never feel cheated, only beaten by your inability.&quot;<br><strong></strong><br><br>&quot;An addictive and challenging yet deceptively simple arcade game&quot;<br><strong>Jay is Games</strong><br><br>&quot;One More Line is most entertaining single button game that I’ve encountered.&quot;<br><strong></strong><br><br>&quot;The controls are responsive and accurate, and if you have a good self-control, as well as a propensity for the psychedelic seventies, this could be the right game for you. 8/10&quot;<br><strong>IGN Italia</strong><br><br><strong>Over 6 million downloads worldwide</strong> Thanks for the support!<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Score Register: <br><br>&lt;10: You're not trying<br>11-19: You can get that without even trying<br>20-25: My mum can get that score<br>25-49: OK you're on the way<br>50-99: Respect!<br>100-199: Fist bump.
