Lured by a vengeful spirit of a defeated witch, Duckles, and his friends, find themselves trapped on a mysterious island full of deadly sorceresses!

Discovering new allies and formidable foes along the way, Duckles must save the Winged Folk, restore peace to the island and vanquish the evils that pulsate in the blackest of hearts, of the Jigsaw Witch!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/512700/extras/38a3f7a118fb9d808145abd7f43d50e2.webp?t=1572473018\" width=40 height=40 /></span> <strong> <br>WHO'S THIS GAME FOR?
