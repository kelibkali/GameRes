Make a name for yourself as a powerful astralchemist and resist the usurpers…or join them!<br><br><i>Heavens’ Revolution: A Lion Among the Cypress</i> is a gripping interactive novel by Peter Adrian Behravesh. It’s entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br><br>You’re an astralchemist’s apprentice in Seyj, an ancient city on the brink of revolution. The work isn’t glamorous—refining oil for lantern fuel, manufacturing gunpowder for the city’s reserves—but it allows you to study under one of the finest minds of the age, Farhad-e Kimiyagar.<br>In a perfect world, you’d only have to worry about which branch of astralchemy—the science that governs both the material world and the heavens—to pursue mastery in. But Vatani Revolutionists have made your life a nightmare. When they aren’t pressuring you to join their cause, they’re raising hell in the streets during your mandatory shifts with the Chakkosh, the city’s citizen soldiers.<br><br>The Revolutionists claim they want to overthrow the satrap and take Seyj back from the She’ri, who invaded half a century ago. But as the child of a She’ri colonist and a Vatani bazaari, you don’t know where your loyalties are supposed to lie.<br><br>Will you join the Revolutionists, telling yourself their cause is just? Will you rise within the Chakkosh, chasing the promise of a better life? Or will you play both sides, hoping you don’t find yourself on the wrong end of a shamshir?<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Play as male, female, or nonbinary; gay, straight, bi, or asexual.<br></li><li>Master arcane astralchemy and craft powerful weapons, including a massive mech.<br></li><li>Defend your city as a Revolutionist or Royalist, or try to escape the conflict.<br></li><li>Join the Legion of the Black Lion to overthrow the satrap and install a new government.<br></li><li>Rise within the ranks of the Chakkosh and command an army to put down the Legion once and for all.<br></li><li>Feed information from one side to the other and profit off the political unrest.<br></li><li>Open your own astralchemical workshop, or secure a professorship at the University.<br></li><li>Find love or friendship with a citizen soldier, a blacksmith-turned-rebel, or even a princess!</li></ul><br>What Will You Sacrifice to Save Your City?",
