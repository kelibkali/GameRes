    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >SHOOT 'EM UP!</h2><br>Just keep shooting! Starlight: Eye of The Storm is a retro 2D Arcade bullet hell vertical shooter. Unleash your special powers, upgrade your weapons, get better ones! Danger can come from any direction, including 3D objects in the background.<br><br>The Full Release shall comprise of the following modes you can play:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Campaign Mode - A storytelling modular mission-based play style where you can choose which missions to fly first. Each main mission consists of 3 short segments that must be completed in order to complete the mission as a whole. There'll be 7 main missions and 8 side missions. Side missions offer a slightly different flavour and can yield different types of bounty. Weapon shop can be accessed anytime as well.<br></li><li> Arcade Mode - A no-frills 10-stage play style where the Weapon Shop is accessed once upon a stage's completion. An abridged version of the whole story without the storytelling elements; all action!<br></li><li> Duel PvP Mode - This is a player vs player mode where you and your friends can duke out above Phobos City armed with weapons of your choice. Experiment different builds, different upgrades and see how much it can change the dynamics of the game. <strong>Steam Remote Play recommended!</strong><br></li><li> Survival Mode - All action, no story. Challenge yourself over 40 different waves. Each wave scales up in difficulty over time and you'll still be allowed to upgrade your weapons to counter them!<br></li><li> Boss Rush Mode - All action, but BOSSES ONLY. Unlocked after completing the Campaign mode once (for good reason), you'll have good initial funding to spec your fighter properly before diving into a 12-boss fight without stop. A good mode to challenge yourself against the big guys all at once. Try the Bullet Hell difficulty to get the best experience - All around the Eye of the Storm!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >DRIFT MODE</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1492210/extras/4072e30b20eecce7997ede463301f134.poster.avif?t=1698718670\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1492210/extras/4072e30b20eecce7997ede463301f134.webm?t=1698718670\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1492210/extras/4072e30b20eecce7997ede463301f134.mp4?t=1698718670\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Drift <i>(auto-pivot mode)</i> around your enemies with style as they may challenge you to a dogfight duel!

(6 months before the events of ) After the experimentation of opening wormholes went awry, several massive wormholes opened up randomly near the vicinity of the already devastated Earth. <br><br>The Council of Foresight has since chosen you and 2 of your top ace pilot friends for the mission to re-establish contact with the Council on Mars. Your ships will therefore deliver the top secret communication data via the massive wormhole and to the orbit of Mars where the local government forces will be waiting. You'll be supported tacitly by allies of the UNC through sales of secret weapons to your team. Since your mission is under absolute secrecy, you'll be attacked by ALL forces.<br><br>As enemy ships (pirates) began pouring forth and your immediate mission is to protect the UNC Headquarters Space Station that is still currently under construction from attack.
