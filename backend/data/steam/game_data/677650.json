To construct cotton mills? Develop new technologies? Build canals? Produce coal or steel?<br>There is no simple answer and the opportunities that arise will be different in each game you play as you move through the Canal and Railway eras, striving to get the best return from your investments in time to snatch the next opportunity from under the noses of your rivals.<br><br><strong>BUILD</strong> <br>Industry is the key to success.
