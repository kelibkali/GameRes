It's time to shine for the PAYDAY gang with the most exciting heist yet - the Diamond heist. You've heard the legend of the Diamond. A meteorite that was found by Genghis Khan. Carried at the head of his armies. Owned by murderous Kings, and tragic Queens. It may sound like a campfire ghost-story. Curses, legends... Madness, death. Together with the Diamond job, you also get four new masks based on figures of old along with their materials and patterns. 7 new achievements have also been added to make things even more interesting.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/337660/extras/eefbc133c1061820d55f973f4f81acf3.avif?t=1756113576\" width=628 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>An all-new heist</strong> – The McKendrick Museum lies just off the Washington Mall. Can't miss the place. Even amongst all those other museums, the McKendrick stands apart. Florentine Renaissance architecture, pink granite and white marble – it's a fitting house for The Diamond. We're hitting just before it opens. You can expect some security outside, watch for that, but there'll be plenty inside too. Guards, cameras and watch out for laser tripwires. Didn't think they'd leave a billion dollar diamond just lying around, did you? <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/337660/extras/b05c0ba58ef94e97ea15e0981f3da9ec.avif?t=1756113576\" width=628 height=368 /></span><br>•\t<strong>Pre-planning</strong> – We have pretty good knowledge of the layout of this place (it is a public building, after all), but the Dentist pulled some layouts of the less-public areas. There's a whole load of useful stuff to spend your favors on, but he's also laying on some specialist equipment for this one. The museum is loaded with valuable loot, so a Glass Cutter will help you crack those displays without setting off the alarm. Don't want to stroll through the front door – use Thermal Paste to burn through the barred windows.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/337660/extras/529536b49e3c0ab52a8290ca560bf77b.avif?t=1756113576\" width=628 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>4 new masks</strong> – Anubis, Medusa, The Cursed One and Pazuzu - four historical and mythical characters that are almost too frightening to behold.
