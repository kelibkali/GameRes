In 30 days, the last Reactor on the planet will explode, along with everything else. Only you can stop it, but the Trusts stand in your way. Before you can save the city, you’ll need to recruit a team and earn enough funds (ISO) to survive. Defeat Trust forces in fast-paced, dynamic encounters to earn the cash and equipment you’ll need to take on the Trust bosses. Reach out to lancer contacts to gather enough intel to reveal the location of their strongholds, then steal their Reactor keys to solve the dark mystery behind the meltdown.<br><br><strong>Rogue-Lite Gameplay</strong><br>Can't stop the meltdown in time? Watch as time loops, but your experience and memories remain.<br><br>When the loop resets, the content changes, making every run unique. Dynamic missions and rewards force you to strategize how best to gather the intel and gear you need to take on the Trust strongholds. As you grow your power, the Trusts will improve their troops with random escalations, keeping you on your toes. If you have the ISO to spare, reach out to lancer contacts to see if you can buy the secrets and ammo you need directly.
