    "description": "Have you ever wished to be sitting next to a fireplace during a rainstorm, camping in the woods, or standing on the edge of a beautiful mountainous landscape? Now you can with this virtual reality (VR) room-scale experience. Available for the HTC Vive, this experience will be more relaxing and exciting than anything available for the price. This game isn't quite classified as a game, but thats the point! It's more of an experience. There has been lack of relaxation/meditation type games out for the Vive on the market and this is a solution to that. It's a place you can go to relax, to reflect, unwind and just listen to the in-game 3D audio sounds of nature/3D sound effects.",
