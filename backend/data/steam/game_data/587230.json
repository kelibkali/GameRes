A welcome relief for weary travelers, the Red Vampires Way Inn provides soft beds and warm meals in the otherwise inhospitable Eerie Forest. Yet beneath the inn, the Red Vampires legacy is not destroyed, but only contained. Tonight an inquisitive guest will break the seal. Its up to the PCs to defend the other guests and themselves from the horrors that are released. Can they survive One Night at the Red Vampire?</i><br>The events of One Night at the Red Vampire occur at the Red Vampires Way Inn.
