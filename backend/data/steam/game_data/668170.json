    "description": "Real-world values provide an authentic recreation of motorcycle racing on your PC. Feel the bike react the way a real bike would, and put your skills to the test as you enter the world of top-tier, virtual motorcycle racing.<br><br>The powerful 600cc engine, state of the art tyres and brakes, let you accelerate at break-neck speed, and stop on a dime. Manage your fuel to ensure you never run out in the middle of a session, and keep an eye on the health bar, because crashing can really hurt! The track surface provides the most grip, but be careful, there’s less grip when the bike's leant over.<br><br>Express yourself on the track by choosing from 11 unique racing outfits. Different outfits provide different levels of protection, with leathers saving you from injury, and costly recovery bills. There are several paint jobs available for your bike, so you can turn heads as you rocket down the straightaway.<br><br>Pay the entry fee to enter the circuit, get out there, and start circulating. Earn money simply by riding around the track, and pay the hospital to get back in the action, should you become injured. Income is earned even when you're not playing the game, so come back and see how much you made while you were away.<br><br>Set the fastest lap in the practice session to secure top spot on the grid, and race up to five players in real-time multiplayer. Bonuses are awarded at the end of each session, and generous prizes given after every race. Compare your progress against the best in the world via the online leaderboard.<br><br>Challenging gameplay provides a real sense of accomplishment, and immersive game design ensures long-term satisfaction. Get involved, and take part in a new approach to social virtual racing.<br><br>Setup your controller in the settings menu, for complete customisation. Pay for what you play with the innovative token system, to get the most out of your game time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Realistic physics recreate the experience of riding the world's fastest motorcycles<br></li><li>Challenging gameplay provides a real sense of accomplishment<br></li><li>Spend virtual cash hiring your equipment and entering the circuit<br></li><li>Express yourself on the track by choosing from 11 unique racing outfits and several paint jobs for your bike<br></li><li>Earn money simply by riding around the track<br></li><li>Income is earned even when you're not playing the the game<br></li><li>Setup your controller in the settings menu for complete customisation<br></li><li>Manage your fuel to ensure you never run out in the middle of a session<br></li><li>Pay the hospital to get back in the action should you become injured<br></li><li>Set the fastest lap in the practice session to secure top spot on the grid<br></li><li>Race against up to five players from around the world in real-time multiplayer<br></li><li>Bonuses are awarded at the end of each session and generous prizes given after every race<br></li><li>Compare your progress against the best in the world on the online leaderboard<br></li><li>Innovative token system ensures you get the most out of your play-time</li></ul>",
