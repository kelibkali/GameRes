The game concept is based on such well-known projects as SpellForce and World of Tanks. In 2018 appeared the idea of creating third-person (+ first-person) magic fights in multiplayer mode. The name «MagVigor» comes from the words Magic and Vigor, which means «Magical Energy» or «Witchcraft Power». Locations are designed for 5-10 players. The goal is to level up your warriors as much as possible for more interesting and colorful magic fights.<br><br><strong>GAME</strong><br>Locations.<br>Inventory.<br>Uniforms.<br>Market.<br>Weapons.<br>Mobs.<br>Effects.<br>Portals.<br>Guns.<br>Loot.<br><br><strong>WARRIOR</strong><br>Skills.<br>Perks.<br>Races.<br>Types.<br>Characteristics.<br>Magic.<br>Strikes.<br>Bombs.<br>Controls.<br>Shields.<br>Weight.<br><br>The Unity + Photon (PUN) technology was chosen for implementing the client.<br>The server part is in a multithreaded version.",
