    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >“In fear I trust” 2nd Episode The Last Desk </h2><br>“In fear I trust” 2nd Episode tells us the story of Nikolay’s memories of horrific events that took place in the school. Nikolay finds a diary and a note from one of the students and recalls what strange things happened with the children, what experiments were carried out on them, which then influenced their aggressiveness. He finds a photo of the girl with whom he became friends and tries to remember what exactly happened to her, and why the school principal carried out all those experiments, and whether it is connected somehow with the VERSA company.",
