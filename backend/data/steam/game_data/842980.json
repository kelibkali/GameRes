For example, Dragon Draft. This is a unique game mode inspired by the popular Autochess genre.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You can bring your heroes into the game, and other players will bring theirs. These heroes are added to the standard selection of heroes in Dragon Draft, ensuring that no two games are alike. When playing in this mode, success depends entirely on your skills and understanding of the game mechanics.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Continuous new game seasons with unique rewards.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You won’t be alone. Clans are an important component of the game. Players gather into clans and help each other out. They also receive bonuses for joint development of the clan.  The Clan Arena provides an inflow of unique rewards. Clan Science gives bonuses. 8 science trees with over 100 different branches of knowledge.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >While some of your heroes are dungeon-crawling, you can use other heroes in the battler.

No tactical restrictions. You choose your own attack and defense decks. You choose who to attack. Plot with other players about who to attack together, or who to help.

You get to assemble another deck of heroes, and fight bosses. There are small, medium, and big bosses for you to face. Each requires a different amount of effort and brings a different reward. You can become the ultimate boss-killer, if you have a strong deck. Or a helper - if you’re still building up your own might. The other players will help you gain strength during the siege. Players fight bosses side by side: sometimes it takes entire clans to take down the most powerful bosses.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Every week, there is a new siege, with new bosses and rewards.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Global battles. Global battles between clans. We have these, as well! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You can assemble your clan, conquer the King of the Realm’s castle, and show who is the strongest clan on the server.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You can also capture the Monster Lair, and defend it against other clans. You get to claim all the rewards and the chance to fight the monsters in the lair single-handedly. But twice a week, other clans have the opportunity to attack you and claim the lair for themselves.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >There is an open market in the game. You can acquire items and goods in the game, in ratings, and in the Dragon Draft - and then exchange them</p>",
