    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Postcards from the Apocalypse is an endless driving sim, punctuated by semi-optional roadside attractions, where it turns into a brief walking sim with a sprinkle of voiced comments and in-game cinematics. It is a tongue-in-cheek romp through all the Post-Apocalyptic tropes, with all the sense of exploration and excitement and none of the mechanical baggage. In fact, Postcards has no progression, no inventory tracking, no puzzles and no combat. Just traversal by car and, occasionally, by foot. The soundtrack is great, as befits a driving game, and each location has its own bespoke track.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >If you like post-apocalysm and driving and don't think it should necessarilly transition to number-crunching or heart pounding action, but could be an introspective take on a dying world, Postcards of the Apocalypse is the game for you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >If not ... well .. you can still give it a go. You might be surprised.</p>",
