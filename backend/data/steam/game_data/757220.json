Plus romance Kelly from Mass Effect. You play the demo now for free.<br><br>The demo is very much in an alpha state. After feedback both good and bad, the game is being substantially improved and the new demo will release later this year. I appreciate if you wish to try the game out. However, it currently has a confusing plotline and game mechanics that are being worked on.<br><br>This is a screenshot from the beta, due out September 2018:<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/757220/extras/12dc8169c89d6afc6fd9fa10d551a40a.avif?t=1529837205\" width=500 height=280 /></span>",
