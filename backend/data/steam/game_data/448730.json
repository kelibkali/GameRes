    "description": "<strong><u>WARNING</u></strong>- This game is for <strong><u>AVX</u></strong>-equipped CPUs only, (2011+)<br><br>Do you like watching others do all the work?<br>Cats do!<br><br>In this unique game you will plan, direct and oversee the construction of a Pyramid in Ancient Egypt.<br>Organize agriculture, plan the village, direct the building and watch <i><strong>thousands of workers on screen</strong></i>, in real time.<br><br>Or not: You may be forced to watch them die of exhaustion.<br>Which is all caused by your incapacity of planning the biggest project on earth.<br><br>So rise to the occasion, and get that thing built, stone by stone!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Game Play</h2><br>Your first challenge, should you accept it, is to decipher the hieroglyphic User Interface.<br>Yes, that's right, the UI uses genuine ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs.<br>But if you want, you can cheat, and enable transcription into English.<br><br>You will need to build a food supply with farms and bakeries, and provide shelter for the workers.<br>And you will also need to hire your labour force.<br>Be careful though: do not hire more than you can feed and shelter: they may die if you fail to do so.<br>Oh, and don't run out of silver either. It is what buys you buildings and labour.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Labour</h2>You will need to hire:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Irrigation Workers<br></li><li> Farmers<br></li><li> Household Servants<br></li><li> Builders</li></ul><br>All of these workers will go about their lives autonomously, in one massive and unparalleled crowd simulation that can grow into a force of thousands of workers.<br><br>But for the impatient Imhoteps among you: you can speed things along by picking up individual workers and place them back anywhere in the world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Buildings</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Farms are the backbone of your civilization. They require irrigation, and provide grain.<br></li><li> Bakeries will turn grain into food.<br></li><li> Tax offices will take the surplus food and provide the project with much needed silver.<br></li><li> Huts are required to shelter your workers when they become exhausted. Food is distributed to them.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Warning</h2>This game uses the latest AVX CPU technology to simulate the crowd.<br>This means you need a recent computer to run this game.<br>Intel Sandy Bridge or newer, or AMD Bulldozer or newer.<br>Check your CPU first for AVX support, before buying. Thank you!<br>(It also requires an up-to-date OpenGL driver -- v3.2 or higher.)",
