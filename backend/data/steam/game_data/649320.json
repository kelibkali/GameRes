    "description": "Constructed between 1904 and 1920, the Victorian Railways DD class locomotive was designed as a mixed traffic locomotive, with capabilities of also hauling mainline passenger services. Eventually numbering 260 members, the DD class locomotives were constructed by both the Victorian Railways and outside locomotive builders, such as the Phoenix Foundry in Ballarat, the Baldwin Locomotive works in the USA, and others. The design evolved quickly, resulting in 5 major variations to the DD class, the fourth being the most recognized with the wide Canadian Cab and high running boards, which would be continued with the type 5 (superheated type 4) locos, and carried on when some members were rebuilt as D2 and D3 class locomotives.<br><br>This pack covers the Type 4 DD class locomotives built by the Victorian Railways Newport Workshops betwen 1904 and 1920, in the Canadian Red and WW1 red liveries as was seen between 1904 and around 1925, covering 92 numbers.<br><br>VR DD T4 Can Red 1 Npt (Full Canadian Red livery with polished cylinder end covers, brass unshrouded safety valves, and clean paint - Newport Built)<br><br>VR DD T4 Can Red 2 Npt (Simplified Canadian Red livery with painted cylinder end covers, safety valve shroud, and weathered paint - Newport Built)<br><br>VR DD T4 WW1 Red 1 Npt (All over Red with white lining livery with painted cylinder end covers, safety valve shroud, and weathered paint - Newport Built)<br><br><br><strong>Features include:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>3 locomotives, in 3 liveries, in broad gauge<br></li><li>Free Roam session populated with passenger and goods rolling stock<br></li><li>9 pre-made consists, including light engine, goods, and passenger consists for each livery.<br></li><li>Scripted, animated, reverser and valve gear in exterior and interior views <br></li><li>Each livery has its own weathering, and detail differences as necessary<br></li><li>LOD on all meshes<br></li><li>Scripted exhaust smoke effects, based off regulator and cut-off<br></li><li>Scripted and animated air compressor, with sound and smoke effects<br></li><li>Scripted cylinder drain effects toggled by ALT + D, and based off the steam chest pressure<br></li><li>Other Scripted steam and sound effects including injectors, and blower<br></li><li>Animated screwlink couplers, brake hoses/taps, and safety chains using ACS<br></li><li>Scripted Marker Lamps and Tail discs, with glow lamps (thanks to Bloodnok) - compatible with the VR Set Train Lamps driver command<br></li><li>Animated cab doors, cab windows, cab roof vent, weather tarp, smokebox door, and tender tank filler lid<br></li><li>Cab doors, windows and roof vent can be controlled from inside the cab as well as via the properties window.<br></li><li>Weather tarp matches in cab view and exterior view<br></li><li>Full custom interior view, with operational controls<br></li><li>Physique based coal load animation in tender, giving realistic deformation as coal is used<br></li><li>Automatic Numbering, with automatic tender numbering, with normals mapped number plates and matching builders plates (92 numbers available)<br></li><li>Snow mesh, using the snow altitude function in Trainz</li></ul>",
