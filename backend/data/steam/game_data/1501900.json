    "description": "Grab your friendly fish mates, bring your tube and water sprayers, and hop into the pool in this <strong>family-friendly battle royale</strong>. Spray your opponents into oil spots to lock them up and knock them out of the match. But beware, spraying water also pushes you in the opposite direction and can put you in a sticky situation. Dodge oil, sharks, buoys, krakens, and more to be the last fish standing! Customize your character to not only be the toughest tussler around but also the most fashionable!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>networked lobby multiplayer suitable to 12 players on each map<br></li><li>Fun and Stylized art<br></li><li>Multitude of obstacles<br></li><li>High-pressure competitive fun<br></li><li>9 maps with 4 distinct themes</li></ul><br><strong>Tube Tussle</strong> was created by a team of 11 students in the Entertainment Arts and Engineering (EAE) Graduate Program at the University of Utah over the course of 3 months.",
