He traces its origin to a nearby abandoned manor, and enters. Inside, he finds something…<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe thing that humanity has denied.<br />\r\nThe thing that memory has forgotten.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhich is longer, past or future?<br />\r\nThis is a novel game to look over &quot;myself&quot;",
