    "description": "Explore and survive fully simulated procedural space stations with or against friends, INTERCEPT 2 seats you as the alien or the crew in an attempt to escape a doomed station.<br><br>INTERCEPT 2 takes place on procedurally generated stations, every single detail is different every single time. Sometimes the medbay may be overrun with aliens, other times maintenance might be running off of emergency power, new challenges and areas await you every single game. Sometimes you step into the shoes of a battle-hardened janitor, making a daring escape for unknown horrors, other times you may take the role of an unexperienced security guard, with barely enough ammo to get by. Every station unique, every story unique<br><br>Looking for more information? Beta access? Development info? Check out INTERCEPT's official discord!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong> Fully Procedurally Generated Stations</strong><br>Every little detail is procedurally generated, providing infinite variety every time you play. Not only randomizing rooms, but generating new connections and details, sometimes vents will connect rooms, or glass will divide you and a very well stocked supply closet. These procedural stations not only look different every time but PLAY different, each run brings new threats and challenges to overcome.<br><br></li><li> <strong>Roguelike Mechanics</strong><br>Every station has a crew. Every time you arrive for work, you will inhabit one of the dozens of procedurally generated characters on the ship. Each with unique traits, jobs, abilities, and gear. Maybe this run you're a trained medic, able to heal any injury, other times you may be an engineer who can take any 2 things and make them explode. Every time you die or escape you will inhabit the body of another crew member, following in the steps of your former self, all on the same shared station.<br><br></li><li> <strong>Immersive Sim</strong><br>In INTERCEPT everything is connected, electrical wires power everything in the station, fires break out and spread, rooms flood with water. Everything in the station can interact with everything else, throw an electrified power cell in that flooded room to stave off the Alien, lay trails of rocket fuel to prepare an ambush, rewire and repower damaged doors. There is no obstacle you can't overcome with a bit of thinking and clever planning.<br><br></li><li> <strong>Full Multiplayer</strong><br>Bring a friend, or two, or 8 to help, or betray you. Alongside solo play, INTERCEPT features full multiplayer support, with dedicated multiplayer features. Not only can your friends play with or against you as crew members, but one can play as the antagonist itself, the Alien. Consume corpses for biomass, evolve, and spread the infestation.<br>With INTERCEPT's deep character generation, some players may not be what they seem, with hidden objectives and malicious goals, be careful who you trust.<br><br></li><li> <strong>VR Support</strong><br>Want full immersion? INTERCEPT has full VR Support, featuring multiplayer cross-play with desktop and other VR players. Everything has been built from the ground up for an immersive and terrifying VR experience.</li></ul>",
