It's also my very first solo project after six years of working on much larger team projects.<br>After all that work on slow pachyderms, I wanted to take a stab at something smaller, faster to make, and granting a more immediate fun.<br>So, I dusted a gameplay idea I hid in a drawer a couple of years back, I set it up as a 30 minutes-a-day project and started working on it during lunch breaks. When the prototype was welcomed quite enthusiastically by the first testers, I decided to make it real.<br><br><strong>Razerwire:Nanowars™ is as a simple little game, quite replayable and with a little nice set of upgrades, achievements and highscores to beat to satisfy the progression geek in all of us.</strong><br><br><strong>It is suggested to play with a mouse, but now since version 1.07, Razerwire integrates full controller support as well</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/788930/extras/4080d4182982dfbeb88436e8224e4018.avif?t=1721133852\" width=550 height=169 /></span><br><br>If you get to have half the fun playing it as I had making it, I think you'll cherish it!<br><br>Cheers,<br>Emiliano, @DokHgn<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/788930/extras/6994b84cfacb278713ceadb3f901111f.webp?t=1721133852\" width=300 height=34 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Use the mouse to maneuver a monomolecular filament (the RazerWire) to protect your generators and kill the nanobugs assaulting them.<br></li><li>Survive endless waves of attackers with increasing difficulty. <br></li><li>Avoid hits on the Generators.<br></li><li>Use the RazerWire to destroy your enemies.<br></li><li>Use left and right mouse click to activate some powerups (like the Antimatter Blaster and the PowerWave).</li></ul><br>Enjoy a rogue-like progress: Survive as many waves as possible, die, use earned points to unlock upgrades and powerups, and then jump back in the fight (there are checkpoints every 20 waves, no worries!)<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/788930/extras/dd234da74b9c11da43f5e545fe679b1e.webp?t=1721133852\" width=300 height=34 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Multiple enemy types with several variants each :<br></li><li>7 Movement types (including Teleport, Accelerating Zig zags and Escaping from the Wire)<br></li><li>4 Shooting modes including homing missiles, scrambling bullets and all-around shooting<br></li><li>2 Armor types<br></li><li>Multiple unlockable upgrades for the Wire including Shields, Armor, Health and Recovery Times<br></li><li>Up to 7 powerups including Anabolishields, Nanoblades and Chrono Molasses<br></li><li>Procedural difficulty increase in the endless waves progression<br></li><li>If you like what you see, feel free to follow me (@DokHgn) and RWNW (@RzW_NW) on Twitter!
