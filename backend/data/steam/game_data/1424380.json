    "description": "Bunker Down is a bomb-survival genre game set in an apocalyptic city. The city is being overrun with aliens and you have to make your way to the bunker deep underground. The aliens are dropping bombs that is destroying the ground beneath you. Throw bombs to keep yourself safe or run away to safety to avoid your doom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay as Bunker Dude in the various game modes including Survival, Apocalypse, Save The Puppy, Rescue, and Story Mode.<br />\r\nAll game modes are compatible with 2 players except for Story Mode.<br />\r\nPvP mode is only available in Apocalypse mode<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Survival Mode, your goal is to survive the falling bombs and safely traverse to the underground bunker while collecting coins.<br />\r\nApocalypse mode is a never-ending, but increasingly difficult rain of bombs. Collect coins and try to delve as deep into the earth as possible.<br />\r\n(If you have an extra controller, try this mode in 2-player pvp mode)<br />\r\nSave The Puppy mode is similar to Survival Mode, but you have to protect a puppy all the way down to the bunker.<br />\r\nIn Rescue Mode, you will find citizens on land or trapped in caves. Escort as many citizens as you can to the bunker below.<br />\r\nStory Mode currently includes 1 short chapter, but I am planning on slowly releasing more if there is enough interest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI also plan on doing updates to add more bombs, upgrades, cosmetics, and game modes for no additional charge.",
