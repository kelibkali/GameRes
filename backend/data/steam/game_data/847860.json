    "description": "Die in the Dark is a first-person exploration and adventure story-based game. It’s more of a thriller than a horror game, even though monsters will swarm you once your flashlight battery dies(Hence the name Die in the Dark). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrapped in the subway with nothing but a flashlight, no guns or knives around. Not only will you face a ton of puzzles but you will encounter zombies, vicious dogs and a slew of other monsters. Burning zombies with your flashlight and hiding in closets might be the best way to survive but you can choose the way you escape the subway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game's story is centered around real-life events that occurred July 2008 in Long Island, New York when the &quot;Montauk Monster&quot; washed ashore. Beachgoers stood there scared and confused. The monster looked like a strange mix of pig and dog.  Not far from the beach was Plum Island Animal Research Center which is known for its innovative animal experiments.<br />\r\nTwo years later another monster washed up on shore but this time it was a human with elongated body parts. Reports suggested that Plum Island started experimenting on humans not just animals.<br />\r\nJuly 2018 the monsters of Plum Island escaped a secret lab in the NYC subway system. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne unlucky subway passenger is trapped on the subway...can you survive and escape?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n8 levels to explore<br />\r\n6 different monster types<br />\r\nBurn zombies with flashlight attack",
