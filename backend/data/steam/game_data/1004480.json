Start the Voltage main game and launch Episode 2 from the game menu.</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Free for limited time for those who have bought the main game!</h2><br><i>New Screenshots coming during the development process.</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Voltage: Episode 2 is Early Access DLC.</h2><br><strong>Why Early Access?</strong><br><i>“Reason for Early Access is to collect feedback about the levels and gameplay overall, and to make sure that Voltage is game what players enjoy to play (is A.I clever enough, how about map design). <br><br>Creating a complete game will take time and we feel that we need feedback about the gameplay. We wan't also explore new ideas with our community and take the time we need to get every detail/map design right.</i><br><br>Early access also allows us to build and increase a community.”<br><br><strong>Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?</strong><br><i>“We would evaluate that the approximate estimate in Steam is 3-6 months. The time may be even longer: for example if we receive huge amount of ideas about map design from our community and we start implementing ideas. It is possible to make a quite huge game with this engine, but we need more ideas from the community because it is possible that our imagination is limited.”</i><br><br><strong>How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?</strong><br><i>“The game engine evolves with speed, so full release will have many more levels and even more advanced A.I. than now. Buying this game now on this Early Access price you will get access our updates (new maps, game technical development...).<br><br>Final version will have at least 3 Episodes. Maybe even more, but at this point we can promise that the number of Episodes will be 3. Each episode have 2-5 sublevels.<br><br><strong>What is the current state of the Early Access version?</strong><br><i>Episode 2 has not been released yet. More info will be announced during the development.<br><br><strong>Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?</strong><br><br><strong>How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?</strong><br><i>“All users can communicate with their ideas, feedback and questions about the game in the Steam forum of the game.<br><br>For example how to bring community ideas to the game:<br>community can help creating new maps by drawing a new map sketches as a .png files and then we here create new maps based to those sketches]<br>give tips what kind of buildings and enemies do they wan't to be placed in the maps]<br>community will also have the opportunity to influence the course of the storyline][/list]<br><br>It is important to note that when you buy this game, participation is not compulsory in any way.
