Level up to unlock more powerful skills.<br />\r\nCustomize your character to be effective at what you desire.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFull Features Breakdown:<br />\r\nMany large terrains to explore with unique abstract textures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Turn Based Combat. Multiple enemies can be fought at once.<br />\r\n-External Combat. Use special External Weapons that allow you to inflict damage or gain advantage<br />\r\nprior to Turn Based.<br />\r\n-Very detailed activity log.<br />\r\n It outputs as much information as possible about everything you do for your viewing.<br />\r\n-Night/Day system linked to survival stat effects.<br />\r\n-Ability to freely pass time into the future (provided you aren't under too many negative effects)<br />\r\n-Mining, digging, fishing, and farming!<br />\r\nAll offer ways to get certain items more easily.<br />\r\n-Customize your name, picture, description, and age!<br />\r\n-Choose hardcore mode. (dying with this invalidates your save so you can't cheat!) <br />\r\n-Or choose resurrection mode so you respawn and don't need to reload a save due to death.<br />\r\n-Fight many handcrafted monsters<br />\r\n-Humanoid npcs for  talking/chatting to.<br />\r\n-Many stats/attributes, including things like Sight &amp; Stealth!<br />\r\n-Skills for both roleplaying and battle. <br />\r\n(Like Analyze, Gambling, Steal, Explosives etc.)<br />\r\n-Variety of build-types possible like Melee, Elemental, or just plain Weapon user.<br />\r\n-Recruitable and Customizable Companions<br />\r\n-Equip the weapon/armors you desire.<br />\r\n-Handy interaction menu allowing you to interact with most things how you want.<br />\r\n-80+ Random encounters<br />\r\n-A couple randomized mission providers<br />\r\n-Shopkeepers<br />\r\n-Innkeepers<br />\r\n-Bankers<br />\r\n-And more!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRedaxium 2 takes place in the same huge game world.<br />\r\nThis therefore implies many areas will stay the same for consistency.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe plot is basically the same at the moment. <br />\r\nIf that bothers you may want to wait if/when more quests/dialog get added.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDifferences compared to first game:<br />\r\n-The Unity3D engine was upgraded to a modern variant.<br />\r\nThis comes with some performance increases CPU-wise.<br />\r\n-Shadows and lighting look much better. (play the demo and you'll see)<br />\r\n-Shader enhancements. Some shaders are now used to make things look more realistic.<br />\r\ne.g. Character's bodies appear smoother.<br />\r\n-I've added Free Form Dialog. Which means your character will have things<br />\r\nto say about some of the locations you reach.<br />\r\n-I added Advanced Mining so you can get useful materials to sell.<br />\r\nThese mines will look like shiny rock-piles when you come across them.<br />\r\n-I added sound fx to the Kamikaze units that chase you.<br />\r\n-I fixed the wrapping on the activity log text. This means far less broken sentences.<br />\r\n-I added a wipe button to the options menu so you can overwrite log.txt.<br />\r\n-I also added some background images for some of the UI menus,<br />\r\nthat lacked them.<br />\r\n-I've added a special junk-selling npc outside the bank in Lagorigana.<br />\r\n-The bank doors close at night. (atleast in Lagorigana)<br />\r\n-There's also a bank vault you can buy atleast in the first town.<br />\r\n-I've added a recycle button to chests so you can destroy items.<br />\r\n-Game Currency has changed to the Gold/Silver/Copper standard.<br />\r\nThis gives you more sensible ways to store money as items,<br />\r\nand understand the value of items.<br />\r\n-Journal now has options to show finished versus not finished quests.<br />\r\n-Home/Guild Lots now exist to be purchased.<br />\r\nThey offer benefits such as MP regen. With Guild Lots offering hirable companions.<br />\r\nYou must find a specific npc to get a specific home/guild. This means it helps<br />\r\nto explore the world if you want different lot options.<br />\r\nGuilds are more costly!<br />\r\nLots also come equipped with They/Them stations that you can activate daily,<br />\r\nuntil you get a Blood vial you can sell.<br />\r\n-There are now perishables that heal MP.<br />\r\n-Combat now has Metas. These allow you to do critical strikes.<br />\r\nMetas fluxuate over time but also build from the skills you use in combat.<br />\r\n-Added a Randomize button so you can randomize your character name when you start<br />\r\na new game.<br />\r\n-There are also items in game you can use to boost Metas.<br />\r\n-More plants have been added to make world feel more alive and<br />\r\ndecorated.<br />\r\n-New creatures: Mutant Abominations that soar across the lands.<br />\r\nThey are called the Glitched and are invulerable and pass through things like ghosts.<br />\r\n-I've reskinned many menus to look different than original game. Stat Menu, Journal Menu, etc.<br />\r\n-The terrains now use a bump texture to give them a more realistic look.<br />\r\n-I've made a fair amount of UI-re-alignment efforts so hopefully things<br />\r\nare more likely to look right than in the first game.<br />\r\n-I've added Clouds. They drift in real time and will change position on the hour.",
