They’re slender, dark, and often cold, but they are the only things that keep you hidden. Keep you alive.<br />\r\nThey are the shadows of the world, and they are where you live. You are a shadowrunner, thriving in the margins, doing the jobs no one else can. You have<br />\r\nno office, no permanent home, no background to check.
