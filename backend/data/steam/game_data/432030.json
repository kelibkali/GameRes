We have tried other pixel editors but still keep coming back to an old copy that we still use every now and then for our games. <br><br>However, as times goes by, we find an increasing need for an actual replacement that is not only up-to-date but more importantly, cross platform (Linux/Win/Raspi/Android/Mac). So here is our attempt at recreating our favourite paint package for today's generation of pixel artists. <br><br><i>It should be noted that this is currently in active development so will contain bugs.</i><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/432030/extras/5c83d9c31c2fe97752cf00d71512ee3b.webp?t=1534794135\" width=600 height=50 /></span><br><br><strong>Features: </strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li> <strong>We don't have a file format - anything created on Swanky Paint can be opened in ANY art software</strong><br> </li><li> Runs on <strong>Linux, Raspberry Pi, Android, Windows &amp; Mac</strong><br> </li><li> <strong>Deluxe Paint shortcuts</strong><br> </li><li> Escher modes: <strong>Hexels, non-Euclidean, strange geometry</strong><br> </li><li> <strong>Bloom</strong> shader options<br> </li><li> Full resolution background <strong>image for tracing and referencing</strong><br> </li><li> <strong>Multiple layers</strong> support<br> </li><li> Simple <strong>animation frames</strong><br> </li><li> <strong>Spritesheet support</strong><br> </li><li> <strong>GIF and APNG import</strong> to frames<br> </li><li> Supports <strong>SVG, GIF, JPG, PNG and APNG</strong> import &amp; export<br> </li><li> Supports Fun64 clipboard conversion to ASCII<br> </li><li> <strong>Dithering</strong> options for paletted and true colour images<br> </li><li> Wrap mode for <strong>tiling preview</strong>, edit anywhere to update the draw area<br> </li><li> <strong>Ultimate undo</strong> remembers your history forever<br> </li><li> Export your image history as a GIF<br> </li><li> Supports <strong>15 popular colour palettes</strong> like Pico8, DawnBringer, C64, ZXSpectrum, NES, Gameboy, MSX, AppleII, EGA, Swanky32 &amp; more<br> </li><li> <strong>Import custom palettes and presets</strong> <br> </li><li> Support for <strong>Lua scripting</strong><br> </li><li> Support for <strong>UV mapping</strong> preview on to low poly 3D model</li></ul><br>These are some of the features that are already included in the current version.
