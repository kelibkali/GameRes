A previously unknown planet was found accidentally as it put itself in collision course with the Earth's ships. With nowhere to go, we settled here.<br><br>A new city was built on this planet that was named shortly-after, &quot;CORPUS EDAX&quot;. New rules and laws were created. Over the years its newly formed World Government struggled to lead a unified planet - any form of cultural identity expression from former countries was prohibited and made illegal. Citizens are graded from A to D based on their aptitude and contribution towards the government.<br><br>After waking up from a medically-induced coma, you find yourself inside a newly built echeloned City. In one way or another, you'll get entangled in the fight for justice with The Salvation, as they see it, or in a fight for you own rule. Help shape the future of Corpus Edax, for a better tomorrow for your fellow citizens (or not, your choice).",
