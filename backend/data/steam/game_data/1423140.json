    "description": "<strong>Assimilate! (A Party Game) </strong>consists of three rounds of finger-pointing fun. Each player is either a human, robot, or programmer (the robot's best friend) and needs to work together in order to win. The only problem, the humans don't know who their fellow humans are so they'll have to use logic, deduction, and teamwork to figure out who they can trust. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1423140/extras/0e20bdbfe3f5e0864e737c66fead1be0.avif?t=1640187729\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1423140/extras_big/0e20bdbfe3f5e0864e737c66fead1be0.avif?t=1640187729 width=800 height=236 /></span><br><strong>Team Humans</strong><br><u>Objective</u>: <i>Identify (and kick out) that pesky robot!</i><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Submit clues describing the password (that everyone but the Robot knows) to prove you're a human<br></li><li>Deliberate among the other players to determine who appears suspiciously robotic<br></li><li>If a majority of the humans correctly identify the robot (or programmer), the humans win!</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1423140/extras/7793b04f7fe107670a62354895675ba2.avif?t=1640187729\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1423140/extras_big/7793b04f7fe107670a62354895675ba2.avif?t=1640187729 width=800 height=298 /></span><br><strong>Team Robots</strong><br><u>Objective</u>: <i>Assimilate among the humans, undetected.</i><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The Programmer helps the Robot bluff their way through the clue-entering phase <br></li><li>Deflect suspicion from your team and accuse humans as being untrustworthy<br></li><li>If a majority of the humans cannot correctly identify the robot or programmer, the Robot team prevails!</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1423140/extras/8d02bd6444b91dee6e2dea60e801a2d0.avif?t=1640187729\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1423140/extras_big/8d02bd6444b91dee6e2dea60e801a2d0.avif?t=1640187729 width=800 height=298 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>&quot;Classic&quot; Play (3 rounds x 4 minutes each) or &quot;Quick Play&quot; (one short, 4 minute game)<br></li><li>Supports all HTML-5 enabled devices<br></li><li>Did a player drop mid-game?
