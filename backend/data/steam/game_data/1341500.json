However, various tragic incidents including murder, and suicide took place in the theatre which resulted in the escalation of the paranormal activities. In 1980, a very tragic incident occurred in which an actress in a wedding outfit got murdered by one of her fans and it was reported that the guy later took his own life in the greenroom. Since then, the various paranormal activities had been reported by the visitors and some of them got traumatized after seeing the white shadow of the lady who was murdered in the premise. <br><br>As a consequence, the theatre business got affected and the owner of The Haunted Exmone Theatre desperately called Omar, the famous investigator living in Los Angeles, to help him getting rid of the ghosts. <br><br>You play as Omar, the paranormal investigator. Will you be able to prove the existence of the Paranormal and get rid of the ghosts?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1341500/extras/a0cf3bbfe2ee0ad014e1ec0c70a638ac.poster.avif?t=1762697050\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1341500/extras/a0cf3bbfe2ee0ad014e1ec0c70a638ac.webm?t=1762697050\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1341500/extras/a0cf3bbfe2ee0ad014e1ec0c70a638ac.mp4?t=1762697050\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Explore the entire theatre for the paranormal evidence!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Come face to face with the unrest souls who are lurking in the shadows!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Experience the poltergeist activities and illusions!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Explore the spirit world and learn the history of the place!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Solve mini puzzles and find a way to the exit!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Nearly Half an hour of Paranormal investigation!</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1341500/extras/100b84443f22b64603855dbee47a1012.poster.avif?t=1762697050\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1341500/extras/100b84443f22b64603855dbee47a1012.webm?t=1762697050\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1341500/extras/100b84443f22b64603855dbee47a1012.mp4?t=1762697050\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Note: I am a solo indie game developer and I have created all of the graphics, artwork, animation, character design, programming, except for the music.
