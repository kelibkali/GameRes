Periodically attacked and razed by various tribes of orcs, ogres, stone giants and humans, it has been rebuilt at least four times, leaving the deepest and most ancient structures accessible only by the ancient sewers and subterranean water courses.</i><br>Now a heavily defended border town providing refuge for many travelers passing through the mountains, as well as purifying much of the ore pulled from the many mines near the town. Recently the town militia have noted a number of missing people who have entered the town but have never left  investigations have led them to the warren of ancient tunnels and sewers under the city, and they will pay handsomely for adventurers to investigate these losses..<br>Mini-Dungeons are small adventures for Pathfinder which are setting agnostic and are easily inserted anywhere in your campaign.<br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included Pathfinder Ruleset.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong></strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included Pathfinder RPG and D&amp;D 3.5/ OGL ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
