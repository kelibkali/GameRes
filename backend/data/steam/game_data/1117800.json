That’s right! Take a tour to the junkyard, or an action house and buy a car, motorcycle, airplane or even a train (if you have enough money of course). Choose between dozens of vehicles in many different shapes and categories.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117800/extras/d2ee27d1c351d74648faa2c6be0c4a09.poster.avif?t=1700679077\" width=602 height=232 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117800/extras/d2ee27d1c351d74648faa2c6be0c4a09.webm?t=1700679077\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>Take a screwdriver, and a wrench so that you can get rid of parts that you don’t need. If that’s not enough for your needs, you can always switch to some more finesse tools such as hammer or an angle cutter to give your vehicle a desired shape. You have a vehicle, a tool set, and it’s completely up to you what are you going to do with it.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117800/extras/ac2cbc9b033ad43984c68606329e01b4.poster.avif?t=1700679077\" width=602 height=232 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117800/extras/ac2cbc9b033ad43984c68606329e01b4.webm?t=1700679077\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>Build the ultimate gaming simulator, that you’ve always dreamed of. Add pneumatics to move an entire rig, or a single element. Install frames, input devices, electronics, audio systems, and finally the heart of the whole project - a PC rig, to bring your build to life. Make use of the welders, drills, and any of the tools in your workshop to put it all together.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117800/extras/ab6123c1afc3b67b9bad5d8c13836039.poster.avif?t=1700679077\" width=602 height=232 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117800/extras/ab6123c1afc3b67b9bad5d8c13836039.webm?t=1700679077\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>If you’re done with all that designing and building, it’s time to test drive your simulator. Choose between few simulations, that you can run on your rig and see for yourself if your build is behaving exactly as you planned, or needs an extra tweaks in some areas. You can always go back to the workshop and push it further until the money runs out.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117800/extras/1b08583c89734fceff6c8c6e0aeae468.poster.avif?t=1700679077\" width=602 height=232 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117800/extras/1b08583c89734fceff6c8c6e0aeae468.webm?t=1700679077\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>Get the best price for your build, put it on an auction and sell it, or exchange for a rare vehicle that’s unavailable on the market. You can also make use of any of the parts left from the original vehicle such as engines, seats, body elements, and sell them all on the junkyard. <br>No need to tell you what to do with that freshly earned money you have right?",
