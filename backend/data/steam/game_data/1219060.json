    "description": "Welcome, human. The lady of the house <i>requests</i> your presence and body to participate in...<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1219060/extras/6af27427e83ffe455aa4a2d9be659b69.avif?t=1676742902\" width=500 height=166 /></span><br><br>A mind-shattering battle royale RPG where you transform yourself and your opponents to win!<br><br><strong>ROGUE-LITE BATTLE ROYALE</strong><br>Create a human character, customise them extensively and compete in one of <i>Missy's</i> frequent transformation tournaments. Each game is unique, with items, traps and events different each time you play. No two tournaments are ever quite the same! Battle across five arenas, each with unique items, perils and landscapes!<br><br><strong>TRANSFORM TO VICTORY</strong><br>Kiss your humanity goodbye, because you won't stay human for long! There are thousands of possible combinations of body parts and dozens of different humanoid species to play as. No-one enters the <i>Missy's</i> arena and leaves without changing. Each big transformation comes with unique abilities and powers. Transform your foes into submission before they can do the same to you, whilst giving yourself all the claws, hooves and scales you need to survive!<br><br><strong>100 ENTER, ONLY 1 CAN REMAIN</strong><br>The arena starts with 100 contestants and the tournament ends when only 1 remains with both their humanity and body intact. It's not only other contestants you must fear; traps, zones and the remains of former contestants all pose a serious threat.<br><br><strong><i>MISSY</i> AND HER CHAMPIONS ARE WATCHING YOU</strong><br><i>Missy</i> is all-powerful, all-seeing, all-terrifying. She bends reality to her will and you are but a toy in her colourful toy paws. Keep moving, keep playing, do not bore her. If you do, she is likely to spice things up at everyone's expense, creating zones of effect, new traps and punishments for all involved. You cannot defeat her... only survive her transmogrifying games. Plus, can you survive her four champions, each bringing with them a new gimmick for the tournament? Stay on your toes/hooves/talons!<br><br><strong>HUMANOID, TAURIC OR FERAL?</strong><br>Your mind will change with your body, so unless you want to lose, it must be preserved at all costs. As your humanity runs low, you will be in danger of losing control of yourself and forgetting who you are. Not only that, but you can transform into half-and-half tauric forms and full-animal feral forms if you allow yourself to be at other's mercy. Balance the physical and the mental and ride the drift of changes to win!<br><br><strong>BIOLOGICAL, MYTHOLOGICAL AND MYTHICAL</strong><br>The shapes that <i>Missy</i> bestows are as numerous as they are inhuman. Gain mutations to your arms, legs, torso, head, eyes, nose, ears, tail, wings and quite a few more! Certain combinations of parts provide unique powers, so try to witness them all!<br><br><strong>FATES OF THE LOST</strong><br>Those who are transformed out of the game are not dead. They are given new lives by <i>Missy herself</i>. Each one has a story to share. Maybe even you. Your changes and the changes of others are recorded for viewing after the tournament's conclusion. What will happen to you, after you've been consumed by the tournament?<br><br>Open your mind, open your body.<br><br>Only then can you win <i><strong>MISSY'S TRANSFORMATION TOURNAMENT</strong></i>.",
