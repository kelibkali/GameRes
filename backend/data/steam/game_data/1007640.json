    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Meanders Map Pack: The Risefalls</h2>Generally speaking it is no surprise that parts of the world should undulate wildly, soaring to great and jagged spires shrouded in mist and thunderous storm - and dipping to lush, greener lowlands and valleys - with extremes of all kind and terrains ranging from ice to mountain, to jungle to desert. Trek these heights with their ravines and chasms and delve into the upper and lower parts of the land where literally anything could be dwelling - tucked away on a mountainside, or slumbering not far from the edge of the road. Dizzying drops and hard going of all kinds await those who would leave the comforts of well-travelled roads and venture amid the Risefalls. Icy Caverns and Ravines, Glacial Rivers and dynamic Exits/Entrances for major encounters, Rickety and Unsure Crossings, Lowland Caves and Entrances, Cliffs, a Desert and Jungle Ziggurat Temple, Teeming Jungles with Perilous Drops and Treacherous Mountain Passes and Spires allow the action to reach new heights and depths.<br>Featuring 24 ready-to-go maps - The Risefalls offers new heights and depths to your adventures.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>1 Winding Mountain Chasm/Harpy Nest Path<br></li><li>1 Mountain Spire<br></li><li>1 Desert Ravine<br></li><li>1 Desert Valley Temple Entrance with River<br></li><li>1 Desert to Ocean Ziggurat Blender<br></li><li>2 Lowland Mountain to Forest Blenders<br></li><li>1 Mountain to Ice Summit<br></li><li>5 Forest Valley Caverns with Roads<br></li><li>2 Lowland Forest Savannah<br></li><li>1 Winding Ice Mountainside<br></li><li>1 Ice Mountain Valley Cave Entrance<br></li><li>2 Ice Ravine inc one with River<br></li><li>1 Ice Valley Cave Entrance<br></li><li>2 Jungle Ravine with Bridge<br></li><li>1 Jungle Ziggurat with Waterfall<br></li><li>1 Jungle Valley River outflow and Fortification</li></ul>Maps are sized specially for FG at 1350x900 and under 500 kb each to help prevent slow-down during play.
