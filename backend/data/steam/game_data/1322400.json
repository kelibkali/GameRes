For example, would you help a merchant back on their feet and make a new friend, but potentially lose out on a profitable deal, or ignore their cries for help to make sure you come out on top? Would you smuggle illicit goods for some easy coins, despite the negative effects it could have on a town's inhabitants? As you make these choices, you are also pitted against time to save your own skin, creating a sense of urgency to amass as many coins as possible.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Bartering System</strong> </h2> More than just buying and selling with currency, <strong><i>Ten Thousand Coins: The Golden Merchant</i></strong> features a system where you can barter goods directly with other traders. Depending on the trader's mood and what each trader needs, different items can have a higher value, therefore knowing what items to offer and when to offer them is the key to a successful trade.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1322400/extras/Barter_s.gif?t=1747197972\" /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Features Include:</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>An immersive and character-focused storyline.<br></li><li>Make impactful choices between altruism and materialism.<br></li><li>A crisp hand-drawn anime-inspired art style. <br></li><li>Various colourful characters and side stories to discover and complete to further build the world's narrative.<br></li><li>Many cities and towns to explore, trade, and build a reputation with.<br></li><li>Hire and assemble various convoys to aid you on your travels.<br></li><li>Random encounters in the wilderness and challenging enemies to battle against.<br></li><li>Hundreds of unique items to use and trade.<br></li><li>Multiple story endings depending on choices made throughout the story.<br></li><li>Two different game modes: Story Mode and Challenge Mode.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Add <strong><i>Ten Thousand Coins: The Golden Merchant</i></strong> to your wishlist today!</h2>",
