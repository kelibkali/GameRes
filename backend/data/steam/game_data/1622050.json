    "description": "Welcome to Elorado, a place dominated by the desert and where everyone fights for water. In possession of a pure reservoir of this relic amidst a derelict amusement park, a group of people establishes a new order based on violence and fear.<br><br>In the fight against Aljah's tyranny, a group resists fighting for freedom and free access to the largest reservoir of pure water available. A battle still far from over. Led by Angela, the Resistance seeks ways to find the best route to the old park and confront the dictator face to face.<br><br>In a top-down, third-person action game, people appropriate what's left in their way in a forgotten ancient world. Control Angela and the Resistance against the Headquarters, and expect to thread on a fine line between enemies and allies.<br><br>In addition to the game, you can communicate with FOX, a mercenary who will do anything for some fresh water and is willing to help your fight against Aljah. Through a mobile application, unlock side missions and find pages of a comic book within the game to learn a little more about the parallel fight of the mercenaries.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1622050/extras/5ec69a972478c2f516f99db74a2efd25.avif?t=1694895290\" width=560 height=152 /></span>",
