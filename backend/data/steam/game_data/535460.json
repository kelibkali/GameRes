    "description": "This is a VR experience which shows how virtual reality can invoke an involuntary response. I created the first scene - the canyon - as I wanted to demonstrate the effect to friends without having to guide them through a game to a suitable point. It was so effective I wanted to expand on it. This is very much aimed at being an experience you can keep in your library and bring out to show new users - it isn't a game so there aren't any challenges in it, and will have less effect on veteran VR users.<br><br>The current stationary scenes are:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A wooden bridge over a canyon<br></li><li>A narrow ledge on a cliff<br></li><li>The top of a building in a city<br></li><li>Being in a dark passageway with only a flip lighter<br></li><li>Being trapped underground with the walls closing in<br></li><li>In the ocean surrounded by sharks<br></li><li>On a window cleaning gondola on the side of a skyscraper</li></ul><br>There are also scenes which include player movement:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Performing a base jump<br></li><li>Swinging round a city with grappling hooks</li></ul>",
