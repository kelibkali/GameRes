Lifestyle being very important, the persona can be very customizable. The way your character looks gives you two main features: pocket size for all the cash and, of course, coolness as a skill. What your character does is entirely up to your imagination.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/517350/extras/0d046d7962b311f12ee259c5c9a20805.avif?t=1494050682\" width=500 height=81 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/517350/extras/2e66ea3365247a5863fc1ee6e6427e42.avif?t=1494050682\" width=700 height=103 /></span><br>   Small crafted or living creatures can be the user’s companions in the paper adventure in which they will never leave the character’s side. They have some characteristics: pocket size, damage and speed. They can receive an attack order and will carry the extra money the user will be making. The pets can find shelter in the Barracks.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/517350/extras/d539ee05e0a8ebbf1e414e924037eb91.avif?t=1494050682\" width=500 height=81 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/517350/extras/aba3327e5227ce9a20aa6b6e1aaec81e.avif?t=1494050682\" width=700 height=103 /></span><br>   Paper and cardboard can be surprising and they have never offered so much choice until now via the customization options. The player’s character is adjustable to any preference. It takes you back to your early childhood. One can choose the gender, the weapons, the clothes for every part of its body, most of them independent of the previous gender selection, and various backpacks. One can dress or equip to be able to, technically, go to any world event, festival or war. All the costumes will be available as unlocks, giving the user the extra choice to actually print their own blueprints and craft them manually. The real life models can then be used as tokens for the Squareface: Board Game.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/517350/extras/ae037281084f8a5105f1d13db150549b.avif?t=1494050682\" width=500 height=81 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/517350/extras/c4391060b797256018e5e4a412ff556b.avif?t=1494050682\" width=700 height=103 /></span><br>   Make an everlasting souvenir aka trophy-like paper toy exactly as your favourite character.
