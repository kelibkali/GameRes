    "description": "'FAUCET VR' is a VR game based on the popular casual mobile game for healing 'FAUCET'. Enjoy dabbling in a fantastic virtual space popping  falling drops from faucet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSewer monsters would interrupt your healing time by trying to block the overflow holes, but don’t worry. You will have a chance to enjoy another kind of pleasure. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can get special rewards by collecting the flying alphabets and stars falling from the sky with a scoop net. When you are in a danger, try using ice and fire. They could be quite helpful.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne more thing. We recommend you to to just relax yourself listening to beautiful music sitting on one side of the sink.",
