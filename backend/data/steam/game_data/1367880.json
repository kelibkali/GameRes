    "description": "Critterland is a fast-paced 2D real-time strategy (RTS) game that pits you against the forces of nature.  Spawn, adapt, and amass your army of plants, herbivores, and carnivores, discovering new strategies and ecological dynamics.<br><br>in Critterland, you design and place <i>critters</i> of various species, and select <i>adaptations</i> for those critters as you build and place each critter in the style of a role-playing game.  Each critter reproduces, creating new lineages that interact with the others in the world.  Your goal is to find synergies between your species that achieve gameplay objectives.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Play Modes</h2><br>Critterland has two play modes:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Campaign<br></li><li>Sandbox</li></ul><br>The Critterland <strong>campaign</strong> is a sequence of increasingly complex puzzle-like levels where you must discover synergies between species to achieve objectives in the world, such as surviving an onslaught of invasive species or living through an apocalyptic volcano eruption.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Critters</h2><br>There are several types of critters:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Plants<br></li><li> Herbivores<br></li><li> Decomposers<br></li><li> Carnivores</li></ul><br>Each category of critters (plants, herbivores, decomposers, and carnivores) has a unique set of <i>adaptations</i> that you design so that each species offers different gameplay dynamics.  For example, decomposers eat dead critters, while plants can be upgraded to eat other critters.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Adaptations</h2><br>Use the Critter builder to select <i>adaptations</i> for individual Critters and place them on the map, where they will spontaneously move and interact with other critters.  Once you have a feel for the gameplay dynamics, you can experiment with the <strong>sandbox</strong> mode to find even stranger ecological equilibria.<br><br>Critters eat each other according to the familiar food chain.  However, you can invert this food chain in certain ways, such as giving a plant lineage the <i>Carnivorous</i> adaptation to turn the tables on the herbivores!  As critters digest, they leave behind poop.  If you design critters that can eat poop, then wonderful synergies may emerge.<br><br>Each category of critters (plants, herbivores, and carnivores) has a unique set of adaptations.  For example, herbivores can have the <strong>Assertive</strong> adaptation which gives them the ability to push away Carnivores seeking to eat them.  Likewise, plants can have <strong>Drifting Seeds</strong>, enabling them to reproduce across the land beyond the reach of the landlubbers who strive to eat them.<br><br>The in-game adaptation wheel offers even more choices and specializations of each adaptation.  Experiment and see which combos you enjoy most!<br><br><strong>Music</strong><br><br>Critterland's campaign offers an atmospheric original soundtrack (OST), also available on Steam.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Fact</h2><br>If nothing else, remember this: wombats poop cubes.",
