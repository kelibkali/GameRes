Inspired by the greats from the 80-90’s with a modern flair. There is a strong emphasis on player freedom through social and moral interactions… Will you choose to firebomb the brothel, the church… Or both? Will you do it for money, glory or just because?<br><br>In Code of the Savage, you and the main character are totally new to Daneth. Explore the land and discover its rich history and lore.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/673100/extras/8be99afe9c7787682ed1a3f112dfedb3.poster.avif?t=1719504168\" width=600 height=250 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/673100/extras/8be99afe9c7787682ed1a3f112dfedb3.webm?t=1719504168\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/673100/extras/8be99afe9c7787682ed1a3f112dfedb3.mp4?t=1719504168\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>I wanted to create a role playing game that brought me back to my gamer days as a child on the C64 and MS-DOS PC. There is just something lacking in today's RPGs that I miss. Tired of micro-transactions, and randomly generated worlds; I am creating a world that is handcrafted with purpose. Essentially, I am creating the game that I want to play.<br><br>Code of the Savage includes a great emphasis on NPC interaction. Each NPC in Code of The Savage has their own story, their own character portrait, and a daily schedule. They will, go about their daily lives, going to work, eating and sleeping.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/673100/extras/d01d143f7538fa6c688405290a2d8b99.poster.avif?t=1719504168\" width=600 height=250 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/673100/extras/d01d143f7538fa6c688405290a2d8b99.webm?t=1719504168\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/673100/extras/d01d143f7538fa6c688405290a2d8b99.mp4?t=1719504168\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Level up your character and adventure forth to discover the treasures, history, and people of Daneth.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Open world</strong> - A large open, seamless, non-linear, hand-crafted world for you to explore.
