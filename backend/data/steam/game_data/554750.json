Our budget for the 2017 game was about $10,000, and the majority of that came from sales from Axis Football 2016. Our small team works on this game during nights (and often early mornings) and weekends, relying on our day jobs to sustain our families and our passion for sim football gaming and the support of the community to continue to improve the Axis Football franchise.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Future of Axis Football</h2>Axis Football has come a long way in three years, but it's certainly not where we want it to be in terms of graphics and depth of features. We made huge strides from last year and have even bigger plans for what we can accomplish next year. Your purchase and support of this game helps to make those plans a reality. We heavily reinvest back into the game, and we hope that is evident with the progress we've made. We plan to release annual versions of the game with improvements to graphics, animations, features, and more!
