It even allows you to define up to 8 seasons to spice that ecosystem up a little. While playing, you can continue to change things: the next ice age is always only a few clicks away.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Turn on random mutations and see what evolution does with your ecosystem</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/997380/extras/5c094ad1efdd8f9385ebffc58eea8601.poster.avif?t=1760962190\" width=600 height=208 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/997380/extras/5c094ad1efdd8f9385ebffc58eea8601.webm?t=1760962190\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/997380/extras/5c094ad1efdd8f9385ebffc58eea8601.mp4?t=1760962190\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>The most exciting feature of the sandbox, at least according to solo dev Wessel Stoop, is <strong>random mutations</strong>. See your algae, plants and animals evolve to quickly fill available niches, see how some species are outcompeted immediately while others bloom for thousands of years... only to die out when their food source evolves a new trick to escape, and a completely different clade jumps in the now vacant niche.",
