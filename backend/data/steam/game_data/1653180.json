    "description": "Have you ever wondered <strong>What Is Love?</strong> But you probably got the whole idea wrong. And so do we! That's why we created this widely messed up game, full of weird ideas, wild choices, dangerous game paths, crazy (I mean c r a z y) plot twists where you can try to find an answer to this question by romancing beautiful girls who hide really dark secrets… Doing exactly what you always wanted to do, but you were too ashamed to admit it (unless you wanted to throw a GMO-free organic banana at a girl, then ... then hell yeah! You will find this in our game!)<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1653180/extras/fe07177b90e77ed854d30d88d9690a8f.avif?t=1666653614\" width=616 height=66 /></span><br><br>Okay, so you are a high school student (how original!) and you meet pretty nice babes on your way. A sweet, joyful neighbour, an ice-cold schoolgirl, a hot young teacher or the cocky school president? Which one do you choose? Or maybe all of them at once? Calm down, nobody judges you. Have fun, laugh, cry or ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). Or do all of the above at the same time? We don't care.

So think carefully before you make any seemingly insignificant decision like: &quot;Hey girl, sure I can pick up the lipstick you dropped... BOOM you just killed the pope.&quot;* Okay, maybe we're exaggerating a bit, but your choices really do matter. Do you want to destroy these girls' lives, use their weaknesses and secrets to get into their panties, make them dependent, manipulate them and show them where they belong? Do you really want this? BIG OOF. But maybe you want to be a white knight who will free these girls from their past traumas and give them a bright new future, full of kindness, affection, devotion and warmth? Dude that's even more messed up. Oh well… I repeat, do whatever you want! Find your answer to the oldest question in the world! <br>Which came first: the chicken or the egg?
