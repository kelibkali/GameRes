    "description": "Just Survive is a post-apocalyptic survival game that immerses you in a world where humanity is fighting to take back control from the zombie hordes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nScavenge for supplies, craft items, and build Strongholds to protect against dangers, both living and undead, that lurk around every corner.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSURVIVAL - Though the great outbreak has passed, the undead still linger in considerable numbers. Stay alert and quiet to avoid attracting them, and be prepared to either run or fight for your life at a moment’s notice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCRAFT - Gathering raw materials is a key part of crafting. Axes, pickaxes, and crowbars allow you to harvest the various trees, rocks, and vehicles scattered around the world. You should collect what you can, when you’re not actively fending off threats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTAKE BACK CONTROL - The first step in re-establishing society is to solidify a foothold in the struggle against the undead, and you can help by building a Stronghold in Badwater Canyon. Each location has unique advantages, so it’s wise to scout before making a commitment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCOORDINATE - Those that want to travel safely, access contested locations, and successfully defend their Strongholds will want to work together with other players. Note that Badwater Canyon is a desperate place, and your neighbors may find that they’re better off just taking what they need from your dead body. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDo you have what it takes to Just Survive?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVisit the Just Survive website https://www.justsurvive.com to learn more about this game.",
