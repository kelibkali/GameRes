    "description": "Follow Elin in her struggle to return to warmth and safety. Somehow stuck in this frozen waste with no knowledge of how she got there, seemingly stuck in an endless loop with no other option than moving forward. You need to help her navigate slippery ice to get back home, all the while trying to stay away from that strange wolf and not collapsing from the cold.<br><br><strong>Please note</strong>, this game is made by a single person on his spare time, if you are looking for a AAA experience, this is not for you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>A strange wolf</strong> seems to appear out of nowhere and chase you.
