    "description": "This app works by balancing the elements.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are four basic elements, each with a movement posture.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Water movement is a small step back with the left or right foot and relates to the kidneys. Hands can be behind the back.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Wind movement is a big step back with the left or right foot and relates to the lungs. Hands can be out to the sides.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Fire movement is a big step forward with the left or right foot and relates to the heart. Hands can be pointing up front.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Earth or Ground movement is a small step forward with the left or right foot and relates to the stomach. Hands can make an open circle in front.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese are the four main movements and there are nine in this app.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is also a 7 minute exercise routine which includes &quot;weight shifting&quot; exercises and mudras (hand energy postures) in addition to the 9 basic moves done sitting and standing!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's fun, interesting, and feels good for the body.",
