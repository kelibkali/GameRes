In this story-driven epilogue, you’ll peek behind the curtains of an oppressive system operated by very ordinary people. It’s a story of the daily grind and crushing violence against individuality.<br><br><strong>Media on Liberated:</strong><br>&quot;Looks like a noir graphic novel come to life&quot; - <strong>Game Informer</strong><br>&quot;There’s really something magical here&quot; - <strong>PC Invasion</strong><br>&quot;The story has echoes of <i>Watchmen</i>&quot; - <strong>PC Gamer</strong><br>“Blends noir comic art style with <i>Inside</i>-style-gameplay” - <strong>Polygon</strong><br>“Feels like an episode of <i>Black Mirror</i>” - <strong>The Sartorial Geek</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1356330/extras/34959715cd9981a876ebf7fccec2d159.poster.avif?t=1596121225\" width=590 height=220 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1356330/extras/34959715cd9981a876ebf7fccec2d159.webm?t=1596121225\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Liberated</strong> is an action-adventure game inside a living, hand-drawn comic book. Uncover an alarmingly current cyberpunk reality where human rights are dying away. Take up arms and solve puzzles in a noir rain-soaked city that’s desperate for justice.<br>Seamlessly merging the art of hand-drawn graphic novels with interactivity and side-scrolling action, it’s a revolutionary combination of video games and comics.",
