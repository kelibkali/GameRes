    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > The Lightless Beacon</h2><i> The Lightless Beacon</i> is set on Beacon Island, near Rockport, Massachusetts, on April 12th, 1926. It is intended as a short introductory scenario for novice Keepers, new players, or both! Experienced players and Keepers should also find something to enjoy here, too. Designed to be run in as little as one hour, this game is ideal for those who don't have the time for a longer game session, or are just building up their confidence with the<br><i> Call of Cthulhu</i> RPG.<br>While<br><i> The Lightless Beacon</i> is presented as a standalone adventure and comes with four pre-generated investigators (enabling you to dive right in), it could also form the start of a new campaign, as it throws together complete strangers and plunges them into the world of the Cthulhu Mythos before they have a chance to catch their breath. There's a mystery to solve, a threat to overcome, and a glimpse at the true horrors lurking in the darkness: all key themes of a good<br><i> Call of Cthulhu</i> adventure!<br><strong> Running the Game</strong><br>Before you run<br><i> The Lightless Beacon</i> , you'll need to familiarize yourself with the<br><i> Call of Cthulhu</i> 7th Edition rules: either those found in the core<br><i> Call of Cthulhu: Keeper Rulebook (</i> available from Chaosium) or the<br><i> Call of Cthulhu Starter Set</i> .<br><i> The Lightless Beacon</i> was first released in October 2019 to commemorate the first anniversary of the passing of Chaosium founder Greg Stafford.<br><i> Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by:</i><br><strong> Robert Lacey</strong><br><strong> Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Call of Cthulhu 7E ruleset.
