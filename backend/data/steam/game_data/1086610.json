    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >  D&amp;D Classics: C2 The Ghost Tower of Inverness</h2><i>  A shadow from the past, the Ghost Tower of Inverness has loomed ever larger in the mind of the great Seer of Urnst. Now he has convinced the Duke that an expedition should be organized to go to the ancient keep and recover its greatest treasure - the fabled Soul Gem.</i><br>The module was originally written for the Official Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game Tournament at Wintercon VIII, held in Detroit in November of 1979. It is the second in the Competition Series - adventures that were used in official tournaments. This adventure contains a challenging setting, a scouring system and characters specially prepared for the adventure. It may thus be used for competition among players (or groups of players), or as a non-scored adventure included in an ongoing campaign. Also included within are background information, referee's maps and notes, encounter descriptions for players, and a background scenario linked to the World of Greyhawk Fantasy World Setting.<br><i>  We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today. Some older content may reflect ethnic, racial, and gender prejudice that were commonplace in American society at that time. These depictions were wrong then and are wrong today. This content is presented as it was originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed. Dungeons &amp; Dragons teaches that diversity is a strength, and we strive to make our D&amp;D products as welcoming and inclusive as possible. This part of our work will never end.</i><br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Mike Wilson, and Terry Buckingham</strong><br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.<br><i>  Converted by:</i>   <br>Terry Buckingham[/b]<br><strong>  Requires:</strong>  The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included 2E ruleset.",
