What's unique - a single ship isn't the end, the dominance of all you can see is. Your first ship is just a step on the path to a massive fleet, from tiny fighters to massive capital ships. Your thirst for power doesn't have to end there, you'll own bases and territory, hard won from their original owners. Use them to build fleets to expand and conquer. From a tiny fighter, easily destroyed, to a immortal space god! That's Void Destroyer 2.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What will you - the player - be doing?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Do easy &quot;milk runs&quot; in your starting ship. <br></li><li>Upgrade it and buy better ships to do more dangerous assignments.  <br></li><li>Explore a ruthless region of space. Discover it's various factions.<br></li><li>Hire temporary wing men, then start building your fleet via buying additional ships. <br></li><li>Leave fighters behind, upgrade to a gunship, then a corvette, then a frigate, and beyond. As your power grows, so do your opportunities.<br></li><li>Fight from the cockpit or bridge of your ship and command your forces via a tactical interface.<br></li><li>Branch off into trading and mining, take over a asteroid field and be paid for your protection, or be a ruthless pirate demanding ransom and taking cargo.<br></li><li>At some point, the only way to grow your strength will be by taking things from others. Capture ships and build up a fleet capable of taking a base.<br></li><li>Owning a base expands your power even further, you can now direct your forces from it, no longer are you tied to a single ship or fleet.<br></li><li>Use your base to build defenses, and ships - soon you'll have more than one, and after that you'll have them all.</li></ul><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/369530/extras/09ea42dad4bda38e4fecf567986f16a7.poster.avif?t=1630517915\" width=480 height=360 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/369530/extras/09ea42dad4bda38e4fecf567986f16a7.webm?t=1630517915\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/369530/extras/09ea42dad4bda38e4fecf567986f16a7.mp4?t=1630517915\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
