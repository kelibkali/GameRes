I have been working alone on this project back in 2018 using RPG Maker MV. After releasing the demo in Itch, it was received positively by the community and was featured by several indie game streamers at Twitch. This is my first game and to know that people genuinely enjoyed what I have created makes me happy.<br><br>I have no background in making games so I had to learn the necessary skills by watching Youtube tutorials. Currently, I am working full time as a lawyer and work on the game in my free time. Fortunately, I was able to save up some money to commission some illustrations and music for this demo. This is a learning process for me so I am grateful for your patience and support. <br><br>I hope you enjoy the demo!<br><br>- Verinius",
