    "description": "This is a game that is designed to assist the user's learning and understanding of Chinese by utilizing a VR environment. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThroughout the game, the user will be guided between basic Chinese lessons by CTAS (an abbreviation for Chinese Teaching ASsistant). Currently, two lessons are integrated into the game: Lesson 1 informs the user with basic counting in Chinese, lesson 2 handles basic Chinese vocabulary. After each lesson, there is a short quiz, which will check if the user was truly able to digest the material given. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is a 1-man developed game by a high school student. Thank you for enjoying.",
