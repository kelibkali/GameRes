    "description": "In Hunted, you must use your ears to navigate a large cave in the company of nature's ultimate hunter: a cave bear. <br><br>To your aid, you have a lantern with a limited supply of oil, which must be constantly refilled, and a shotgun which just might be your way out of here. If you're lucky, you might just be able to kill the bear.<br><br>The twist? You can barely see a thing. Aside from your immediate surroundings, its all blackness. And yet your hear quite, insistent footsteps coming ever closer...<br><br>JUMP SCARE WARNING!<br><br>Hunted is not a normal horror game - you have to use your ears more than anything. If you don't, well... by the time you see the bear it's too late. <br><br>If you feel like it, you <i>could</i> always throw your lantern in the direction of the footsteps, and if it illuminates the bear, well then all the better! But if you miss, you'll be stuck in total darkness unless you can get the lantern back. And in this cave, that might prove treacherous.<br><br>Hunted is guaranteed to get your blood pumping and your heart racing as you strain you ears for any sign of the bear.",
