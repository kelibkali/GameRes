    "description": "As the biggest city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Cologne has an extensive public transit network. The city railway and bus lines are being operated by the Kölner Verkehrsbetriebe AG (KVB).<br><br>In this add-on für OMSI 2, you drive on one of the most highly frequented bus lines in Cologne, the line 132. It takes you from Breslauer Platz at the main station via Heumarkt, Severinstraße and Chlodwigplatz southwards along the Bonner Straße to Rondorf and on to Meschenich. It is an interesting and diverse route – you’ll drive through the metropolitan downtown with its famous buildings like Severinstor Castle all the way into the Cologne’s rural outskirts around Meschenich.<br><br>The routing in this add-on is highly accurate. Numerous 3D objects were created based on their real-world counterparts, thus conveying a realistic impression of the city of Cologne. <br><br>Also included is a corresponding bus, the Mercedes “Citaro”. It comes in both a city bus and articulated variant.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/935510/extras/1a793997ff716d4975eae772eaa367ae.avif?t=1726493091\" width=616 height=68 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>KVB line 132, Breslauer Platz main station – Frankenstraße in Meschenich<br></li><li>Length ca. 13.5 km<br></li><li>28 bus stops<br></li><li>Travel time ca. 51 minutes<br></li><li>Mercedes Citaro (city bus and articulated bus)</li></ul>",
