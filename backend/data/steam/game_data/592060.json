Here, slaves and criminals are given a chance to repay their debts to society, or at least give the bored and idle rich a good show.<br><br>It is also a place of secrets, of great danger and intrigue. For one man, trying to win his freedom to find that which is most precious to him once again, it is a place of destiny, both for himself, and for an Empire.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Other Warfare titles</h2><br><br><br><br><br>",
