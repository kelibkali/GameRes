    "description": "I did not see a marching simulator on the market, so I made one!  This is a 2D, sprite based marching simulator.  It is intended to give the user what it would feel like to march a military formation, as well as see how well they can do!  You will give commands by keyboard or mouse to a flight of 12.  These 12 must execute 10 commands from a list of 27 within a 70 ft by 70 ft area.  Your score depends on how fast your flight can execute your commands, and how well you stay in your are.  Do you have what it takes?  This is a constant work in progress so any feedback is appreciated.",
