Two hours afters after her arrival, she lost contact with the outside world. These are the events of that night. These are the remains of a ghost story, told for the sake of a Ghost.</i><br><br>Waking up disoriented and weary, Tabby (Short for Tabitha, but she's not gone by her full name since 3rd grade) wakes up in the parlor of an abandoned house. Her keys, wallet, and phone are missing and she can't remember why she's in such a place... not that it's too far gone from some of the other places she's woken up in over the years.<br><br>It doesn't take long for her to meet Evie, a ghost, and this greatly irritates Tabby on account of she was hoping to just grab her things and leave quickly. The Larkspur house on 77 Oleander, however, is not Evie's home. It is not the site of a bittersweet tragedy. It is not the skeleton left behind by a family's unexpected death. Tabby will realize this too late, and then, when she's finally ready to heed Evie's warnings, she will forget.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About the Game</h2>77 Oleander Avenue Ghost House Investigation is a narrative driven Horror Mystery game that follows Tabby, a paranormal investigator who wakes up in an abandoned house with no memory of where she is or why she's there. Through the course of the game you'll learn more about the family that once occupied the home, the mysterious circumstances surrounding their deaths, and ultimately decide what you believe about the haunting of 77 Oleander. Set in a small coastal city in southeastern North Carolina, the game explores deep-seated religious trauma, the nature of ghosts and demons, the way we create narratives of a person's Death, and contemplates the prospect of flirting with a supernatural orb.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2103630/extras/afd0252ecf40eaa4ae3ed63fec1a1519.avif?t=1671462587\" width=510 height=218 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Instructions and Controls</h2><br>77 Oleander is a Visual Novel in which you'll need to explore the rooms and levels of an abandoned house in order to find your cell phone, wallet, and the keys to your truck so that you can get out as soon as possible.
