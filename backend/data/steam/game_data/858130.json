    "description": "This is the Lake Ridden soundtrack, composed between 2016-2018 by Swedish composer Patrik Jarlestam, in both FLAC and MP3.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe OST comprises 18 songs which are in the game, and 8 that either didn’t make it into the game (20, 23-26), are versions of what did end up in the game (21-22) and 19 is a standalone version of Sofia’s theme which is found throughout other tracks in the game. Track 17 Music for ghosts contains all the themes for the ghosts in the game, even though this track is only heard in snippets here and there, and the ghost’s themes are usually quoted in other tracks instead which are found throughout the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou might wonder why the tracks are named just after places in the game instead of having more evocative poetic names.  Well, I felt that this was the right way to go, since that is how it was composed originally. The tracks’ names are modeled on the places they represent, but the music in itself, tells its own story, hidden melodically and thematically within the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTracklist:<br />\r\n01 The Forest<br />\r\n02 The Lower Garden<br />\r\n03 The Upper Garden (ambient)<br />\r\n04 The Upper Garden<br />\r\n05 The Estate (master+day)<br />\r\n06 The Wharf<br />\r\n07 The Courtyard (day)<br />\r\n08 The Courtyard (night)<br />\r\n09 The Island (first)<br />\r\n10 The Island (second)<br />\r\n11 The Root Cellar<br />\r\n12 The Laundry<br />\r\n13 The Laundry Jack<br />\r\n14 The Dreamscape 1<br />\r\n15 The Dreamscape 2<br />\r\n16 The Dreamscape 3<br />\r\n17 Music for Ghosts<br />\r\n18 Main theme (Marie and Sofia)<br />\r\n19 Bonus - Sofia Cello theme<br />\r\n20 Bonus - Sofia Synth Theme<br />\r\n21 Bonus - Dreamscape 1 (Original)<br />\r\n22 Bonus - Dreamscape 2+3 (Original)<br />\r\n23 Bonus - Estate (day - variation 1)<br />\r\n24 Bonus - Estate (day - variation 2)<br />\r\n25 Bonus - Estate (day - variation 3)<br />\r\n26 Bonus - Estate (night)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can find both FLAC and MP3 versions of the soundtrack in your Steam directory …Steam/steamapps/common/Lake Ridden/Soundtrack",
