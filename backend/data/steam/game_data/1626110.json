    "description": "<i> <strong> Space Porter </strong> </i> is a 2D top-down puzzle game made in hand-drawn graphics.<br>You are in space at the station, where you control an astronaut, whose task is to sort the boxes. It is necessary to place the boxes in the designated places. An astronaut can move only one box at a time, pushing it through the cells. It is necessary to brainstorm and calculate the moves in advance in order to pass this or that level, because there are a lot of boxes, and there is not enough space for their movement.<br><i> Good luck at the marshalling space station! </i>",
