    "description": "Contorted Information Skin is a keyboard skin without key-caps markings for advanced users who already know how to touch type effectively atleast 60+ WPM. The appropriate finger still lights up when a key is striked. 5 second WPM counter is in this keyboard to help you to see your speed during the previous 5 seconds while typing. It has a Key Rollover Counter as usual with all of my skins. It has a total WPM twpm counter which displays the WPM that you've been typing over an amount of seconds and or minutes depending upon when the short-cut key is pressed. It works exactly like the base game which is color-coded that I've posted to teach people how to touch type effectively.<br>--<br><strong>Why am I teaching this course?</strong><br>I think that everyone needs to know the knowledge, so that they can better protect their information.
