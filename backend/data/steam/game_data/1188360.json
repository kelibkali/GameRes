This award-winning team with over half a million subscribers behind their Hearts of Iron IV: Road to 56 project are bringing five categories of content:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Unique High-Risk Missions USA &amp; USSR:</h2>Throughout the game, certain unique opportunities will arise for dangerous espionage missions. These have powerful and unique effects in the game, such as being able to take enemy submarines out of service and catching up in the nuclear arms race. You only have one shot to pull these off and the consequences for failure can be devastating, so plan carefully!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Unique Domestic Programs USA &amp; USSR</h2>Within your own territory, it will now be possible to fund wide-reaching programs, many of which are of an ethically dubious nature. This includes being able to intercept the communications of your own populace and even look into the creation of super soldiers and supposed extra-sensory abilities. If you don't mind the possibility of your citizens finding out of course.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >International Crises</h2>Failure in the above missions and programs can lead to a major crisis that plays out on the world stage. When you are called to the United Nations to answer for your actions know that you are engaging in a dangerous game that can lead to vindication or condemnation in the eyes of the international community.<br><br><br>*Extra content does not provide you an advantage in Multiplayer. When connecting to a player with a higher tier DLC the game for both players will always play the highest DLCs available.",
