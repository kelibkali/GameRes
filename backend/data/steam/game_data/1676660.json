She was moody because when she was a little kid,  at a frightful and unforgettable moment, her father has disappeared into nothingness right in front of her in a glimpse of an eye. Leaving her alone against the world. She could only grab a tiny slice of his dark red shirt and held onto it since. Cried a lot that night and the tears never left her eyes still. She made a locket and hidden the part of her father's shirt inside.<br><br>Nightmares and sorrow were with her constantly but she somehow survived doing what she can do best. Crafting clothes and selling them to passing merchants. since last year she's often been haunted by more intense nightmares of fighting with herself during her sleep. Lately, she had so much of these, she became afraid of sleeping.<br><br>Just when she had enough and were crying in her bed not knowing how to defeat these horrors, she noticed a glowing little ball figure out her window near her hut. Curiously, she tried to go near it and understand what it is. Just at the moment she raised her hand to reach the glowing figure, she glimpsed at her 'ghost' self standing afar! Seconds later, she fainted.<br><br>When she woke up, she was in a place unbeknownst to her and apparently, some haunting events occur out of nowhere...",
