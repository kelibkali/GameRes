    "description": "Inspired by '90s console classics, DiscStorm's soundtrack fuses modern dance trends with retro chiptunes. Each track is designed to evoke a strong feeling of the arena it's written for using a blend of nostalgic and contemporary synths, whilst still retaining the frantic, fast-paced nature at the game's heart.<br><br>DiscStorm was the first major project I have worked on as either a developer or a musician. I've been writing electronic music since I was a child, so I was thrilled to finally apply it to making a game. Inspired by artists like Bossfight and Zircon, I really wanted to attempt a fusion of old and new, whilst still reflecting the mood associated with each of our game's settings. I truly hope that you enjoy the OST.<br><br>Thank you so much for listening!<br>Luke<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >DiscStorm Official OST</h2><br>1. DiscStorm (0:41)<br>2. Jungle Temple (3:50)<br>3.
