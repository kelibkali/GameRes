You receive the mission to travel to remote villages, <strong>find and destroy the target military camps and eliminate all terrorists</strong>. But as in real life, there are many civilians in the villages, as well. The terrorists and civilians alike are at the player’s mercy. It is up to the <strong>player alone to decide</strong> how to handle this mission. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/546500/extras/7d711e214fd98f5bfb231d3433a98ce5.avif?t=1482265426\" width=600 height=288 /></span><br><br>Bernd Geiblinger: <i>&quot;I for one do not enjoy playing brutal, bloody games, so for me it is painful to create death animations and blood. I did everything else before I did this kind of work - but I am doing it for the message. This is also why Tank it! will be available for a very low value - For me it is much more important to spread the message of the game than to earn a great deal of revenue.&quot;</i>",
