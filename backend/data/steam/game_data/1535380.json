    "description": "Discover the different sonic landscapes of the atmospheric platform adventure game „Minute of Islands“ by Studio Fizbin. Embark on a colorful acoustic journey ranging from catchy melancholic melodies to dark nightmarish textures. The music was rearranged, extended and remastered for an immersive and entertaining listening experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThomas Hoehl, award winning film and video game composer, wrote an adaptive emotional score with an unusual collection of instruments and musical styles that lets you experience the emotional rollercoaster of Mo, the female protagonist of the game. Each of the various islands you visit in the game was approached with a different but coherent soundset in mind mirroring their nature and inhabitants. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis download also contains bonus tracks that did not make it into the game.",
