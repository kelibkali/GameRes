    "description": "MSK production presents first rendition of the Jinnah International Airport Karachi for X-Plane 11.<br><br>Jinnah International airport is Pakistan's largest international and domestic airport. It is located in Karachi, Sindh, and its passenger terminal is also commonly known as the Jinnah Terminal. The airport is named after Crown attorney/statesman Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan and its first Governor General, who was popularly known as the Quaid-e-Azam (&quot;Great Leader&quot;).<br><br>The airport provides primary hub for the flag carrier; Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Shaheen Air International, and Airblue as well as many other private airlines. The airport is equipped with aircraft engineering and overhauling facilities including the Ispahani Hangar for wide-body aircraft.<br><br>Karachi was once a much busier airport. Between the 1960s and 1980s it was an online station of several major airlines of the world including British Airways, Interflug, TAROM, Alitalia, JAT Yugoslavia Airlines, Aeroflot, Philippine Airlines, Nigeria Airways, Ethiopian Airlines, EgyptAir, East African Airways, Kenya Airways, Air France, Qantas, Pan Am, Royal Jordanian, Libyan Arab Airlines, Japan Airlines, Syrian Arab Airlines, Middle East Airlines, Swissair, and SAS. However, due to the emergence of Dubai's airport on the world map, increased usage of longer haul aircraft, and the political climate of Karachi during the 1990s, several airlines discontinued their service to the airport.<br><br>In the past couple of years Karachi has seen a reversal in fortunes. The dwindling numbers of international airlines have stabilized and whilst there hasn't been a marked increase in the number of airlines flying in to Karachi, some have either increased the number of flights or resumed their old operations.<br><br>Economic factors may be partly responsible for the upswing in activity at the airport. As industrial growth in Karachi and the rest of Pakistan expands, some European and Asian carriers are mooting resumption of services to Jinnah International.<br><br>Airlines that visit this airport include:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Air Arabia     <br></li><li>Airblue     <br></li><li>Air China     <br></li><li>Cathay Pacific<br></li><li>Emirates     <br></li><li>Eritrean Airlines     <br></li><li>Etihad Airways     <br></li><li>FlyDubai     <br></li><li>Gulf Air     <br></li><li>Iran Air     <br></li><li>Iraqi Airways     <br></li><li>Oman Air     <br></li><li>Pakistan International Airlines<br></li><li>Qatar Airways<br></li><li>Shaheen Air     <br></li><li>SriLankan Airlines     <br></li><li>Thai Airways International     <br></li><li>Turkish Airlines     <br></li><li>Cargolux     <br></li><li>Etihad Cargo<br></li><li>Operated by Atlas Air     <br></li><li>Midex Airlines     <br></li><li>Qatar Airways Cargo</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1689290/extras/5d75590246c1db446e324a2c5681b379.webp?t=1694785094\" width=616 height=61 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>All major airport buildings included<br></li><li>Taxiway signs, and other small details<br></li><li>Numerous static objects such as service vehicles<br></li><li>Very detailed taxiways and runways<br></li><li>Animated Ground Vehicles<br></li><li>Very good frame rates<br></li><li>Night Lighting Included<br></li><li>High Definition ground texture files<br></li><li>Special Specular and Reflective textures used for ground</li></ul>",
