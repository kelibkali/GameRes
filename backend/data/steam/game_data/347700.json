Its that feeling of nostalgia that takes you back to the days of your youth, where endless hours were spent guiding your favourite team through match after match, on your quest to secure the league title. <br><br>Don't get us wrong, we do appreciate what new technology has brought to soccer games such as FIFA and PES. Accurate player kits, player faces and in-depth player and tactical behaviours all enhance the game experience. But these games have also become too realistic and lack something that the older generation 8-bit soccer games had. A mix of character, fun and imagination.<br><br>What if we could create a game that had a similar 8bit &quot;look and feel&quot; to the golden soccer gaming era but at the same time took advantage of advances in technology. Like recreating individual player characteristics and offering more depth in player animations. <br><br>That's exactly what we want to achieve with Pixel Soccer. We are soccer fans like you. We are computer game fans like you. We want to build a game that feels like the soccer games of our childhood and for that we need your help.",
