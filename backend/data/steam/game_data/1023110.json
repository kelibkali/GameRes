    "description": "<strong>Seven Red Lines</strong> is a simple geometric game. Everything you need is to connect circles by drawing red lines. Not green, not blue, just RED. And follow numbers inside circles, by the way. That’s it. No more rules.<br><br>The game contains 4 modes. Each mode is available after completing previous one.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A mode (7 sets of 7 levels)<br></li><li>B mode (7 sets of 7 levels)<br></li><li>C mode (7 sets of 7 levels)<br></li><li>Extended (thousands of levels)</li></ul><br><strong>A mode</strong> we described above.<br>Levels in <strong>B mode</strong> have excess lines, so you will need just to remove them. It is supposed that you can’t draw new lines in this mode.<br>In <strong>C mode</strong> numbers in circles will reduce after drawing each line. Also you aren’t allowed to clear lines.<br><br>In <strong>Extended mode</strong> you can select complexity (S, M, L, XL) and play all possible levels. Yes, there are lots of levels.<br><br>Interested? What are you waiting for?",
