    "description": "<strong>Cereal Soup</strong> is an MMO-style animal roleplaying game set in the dangerous and strange world of Primordial. Take the role of a completely unique character that grows as you do. Join a tribe, become skilled, make new friends, and change the world; together, for you are never alone.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/838900/extras/f35a8da32b8050d8c982200c31657a22.avif?t=1693568468\" width=596 height=200 /></span><br><br>Welcome to Cereal Soup! This project started all on it's own at the end of 2013, and was released the next year to the public in early Alpha. The game was made to fill a hole in the animal gaming community, and thanks to the amazingly talented people of this community CS has continued to grow and improve. Primordial is a world where creatures reign, Gods control all, and banding together to form powerful tribes is only one way to survive.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/838900/extras/44b108dd0d0af9540e4d3d553a2f54c4.avif?t=1693568468\" width=596 height=200 /></span><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Play as a mongoose (Suricate), wolf (Canis) and lion (Felis).

It already has a sprouting community (Which I have found to be one of the best parts of the game), functional website, and good graphics for its stage. Perhaps, though, there is room for effects of this game's lore. Players don't particularly see many effects of the lore-based characters in-game, but perhaps this is just coming. If that is the case, then I can't wait to see what the developers will do with it!&quot;</i> -Lisa570<br><br><i>&quot;Cereal Soup is a very great MMORPG game. You can play, explore and chat with others! It's a creative game, you can create characters, what colored you'd like! &lt;3  Lots and lots of adventures are here&quot;</i> -Kind Vampire Wolfen<br><br><i>&quot;A fun place to make friends and start ideas, I ended up with an over 100-page story from just farting around with gameplay and my unexplainable imagination.&quot;</i> - DearBlackenedWolf<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/838900/extras/19773659c739f02fe1fb5d711afe5141.avif?t=1693568468\" width=596 height=200 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Want to follow the progress?</h2><br>Our Discord is the place to be!
