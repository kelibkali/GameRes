All of the games can be started from one application, so you can jump between playing The First Encounter level to a Serious Sam 3 level and back without exiting the game. When listing game servers, servers playing TFE, TSE, SS3 – will all appear in the same list and you can vote map across games if you want. <u>Oh, and owners of our VR games are able to play multiplayer together with their &quot;flat&quot; counterparts!</u> <br>Since there are so many changes and exciting new features, we'll just go ahead a list them here as bullet points.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Cool new features in Serious Sam Fusion 2017</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>All games now support SteamOS/Linux/OSX!<br></li><li>Split-screen!<br></li><li>64bit executables<br></li><li>Support for Vulkan API (DirectX9 is now being removed) <br></li><li>Multithreaded rendering<br></li><li>The new &quot;light-weight&quot; savegame system - savegames are now saved much faster, are very small and stored in the Steam cloud, and savegames still work even if a level is changed in a patch, or if a mod is updated<br></li><li>Full support for all controllers including Steam controller, PS4 gamepads, all older DInput joysticks <br></li><li>Proper multimonitor support <br></li><li>Borderless window support <br></li><li>Customizable sound outputs <br></li><li>Proper 3D audio using a proprietary sound-mixer (the same approach as used in the old Classic games) <br></li><li>Improved physics engine with better handling of character movement <br></li><li>Texture streaming in all games <br></li><li>Much better modding support with customizable weapons and items, improved scripting (including better support for scripting networked games) <br></li><li>Lots of other improvements, optimizations and fixes </li></ul>",
