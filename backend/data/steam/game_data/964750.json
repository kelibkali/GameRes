    "description": "This game takes place in a fantasy setting, where a young man called Nelson inherits a cabin from his deceased uncle Sid, not knowing, that the uncle had a magic cauldron during his lifetime. Nelson travels to the island, where his uncle lived and could not imagine, that the legacy will not mean wealth but responsibility.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are a lot of crazy characters, including dead uncle Sid - who will appear as a ghost -, the stone cold undertaker, the confused baron, a soup-cooking witch and the vegan zombies. It is a game of magic and a lot of humor - with many hidden jokes about other games and movies - as a homage, of course.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures<br />\r\n- A classic Point and Click Adventure in Comic-Style<br />\r\n- All graphics are handmade<br />\r\n- Cinematic Soundtrack<br />\r\n- A Quick travel feature with map will save unnecessary walkways<br />\r\n- No annoying logic puzzles<br />\r\n- Many crazy characters<br />\r\n- Black Humor",
