    "description": "Tesseract VR is a game where you can have a first person shooter vr experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAntic Egypt... Stones coming out of a space shuttle... The idea of the game is to prevent space shuttle from building a massive monument.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you start choose from the day or night options. Then all you have to do is to put the stones coming from the space shuttle above to an order using the controller. When you create a full line, those lines will disappear. If you cannot destroy the lines the bricks will start going higher and higher. When they reach the space shuttle it means the game is over. You can start a new game and continue the fun.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the game you can also shoot the mummies walking around with the other controller. This won’t effect your score but it adds to the experience.",
