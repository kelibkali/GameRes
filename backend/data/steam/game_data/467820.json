    "description": "<strong><i>Please Note: The player-base of Zero G Arena is currently such that you are unlikely to find other players online by chance. If that is a deal-breaker for you then I cannot suggest you buy the game. Otherwise, Zero G Arena does feature bots, private servers and has an official discord which players can use to arrange matches. See below for a full list of features.</i></strong><br><br>Zero G Arena is an arena shooter with <strong>zero gravity, ragdoll physics, grappling beams and magnet boots</strong>. It's an intense combination!<br><br>The game is designed to work on multiple levels of play:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The novelty of the mechanics and the sheer fun of floating and swinging about the levels provides a fun experience at any level of play.<br></li><li>The outlandish hijinks that are enabled by the ragdoll physics, grapple beams and fast-paced action make the game hilarious fun to play casually with friends (or with friendly strangers on public servers...).<br></li><li>At it's core, Zero G Arena is a balanced, competitive game with an extremely high skill-ceiling. Mastery of the movement mechanics is of more importance than aiming ability. You may also be surprised by it's tactical depth (feel free to ask me on the forums for more about this).</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay</h2><strong>Movement</strong><br>You can toggle your boot magnets freely to switch between running on magnetic surfaces or floating with zero gravity ragdoll physics. <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/467820/extras/520e6c6888fbd71f9f9169e7aaa0c9ce.poster.avif?t=1575196661\" width=576 height=324 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/467820/extras/520e6c6888fbd71f9f9169e7aaa0c9ce.webm?t=1575196661\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/467820/extras/520e6c6888fbd71f9f9169e7aaa0c9ce.mp4?t=1575196661\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>You also have a grappling beam, which can be used to pull yourself around and swing about while floating.<br>As well as these technological locomotive methods, you also have a powerful set of core movement abilities:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A set of basic jumps, which can be controlled intuitively using the spacebar and movement keys.<br></li><li>A wall-jump, which can be used while floating to bounce from wall to wall.<br></li><li>A crouch ability, which can be used to do a crouching slide on magnetic surfaces to dodge enemy fire.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/467820/extras/eced40418580d8a310d3a964af654eee.poster.avif?t=1575196661\" width=576 height=324 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/467820/extras/eced40418580d8a310d3a964af654eee.webm?t=1575196661\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/467820/extras/eced40418580d8a310d3a964af654eee.mp4?t=1575196661\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></li></ul><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Zero G Arena features a set of 5 futuristic firearms.
