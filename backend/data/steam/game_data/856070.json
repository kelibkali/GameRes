    "description": "In collaboration with JemFX, Performance Filmworks and Keslow Camera, The Mill created The BLACKBIRD®, the first fully adjustable car rig that creates photoreal CG cars.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUntil it’s launch, automotive content was often dictated or hampered by car availability, model revisions, limited access to locations and footage that can quickly become irrelevant. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Mill BLACKBIRD® is able to quickly transform its chassis to match the exact length and width of almost any car. Powered by an electric motor, it can be programmed to imitate acceleration curves and gearing shifts and the adjustable suspension alters ride height, rigidity and dampening to replicate typical driving characteristics.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nThe Mill BLACKBIRD® VR Experience allows users to explore all of the configurable features of The BLACKBIRD®, allowing users to interact with the unique rig functions including the bespoke systems created by The Mill, used to capture light and reflection data.",
