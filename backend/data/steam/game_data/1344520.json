    "description": "Apprentice Arriving is a narrative-driven 3D-Fantasy RPG played in 3rd-Person with a unique set of gameplay elements that heavily focus on character development and growth. Guide Prince Landon’s way as he fights Maira’s mystical creatures to become a true and worthy Paladin. But as your slumbering powers grow, so do the dark forces tracking your every step.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1344520/extras/f972c53aee045f6d47c02d56c49d0441.avif?t=1734641151\" width=620 height=124 /></span><br><br>In a land ravaged by wars between mankind and the forces of evil, a placid kingdom was born by the hand of Queen Licy and her benevolent husband. Founded as a safe haven against the voracious darkness in the world, the Kingdom of Aclendi prospered for years under the guidance of her two sovereigns, who gave birth to a son and spent most of their years together in peace. Until the day the good king died, under mysterious circumstances<br><br>Prince Landon attended the funeral, only to see his mother magically disappear <br>before his very eyes. Rushing to his mother’s room, Landon found but a letter of hers<br>as his call to adventure. The letter invited Landon to an unknown place called &quot;Dormum&quot;.<br><br>Landon’s yearning for adventure needed no more; the Prince, who had never left the kingdom in his lifetime, resolved to depart for Dormum. On his journey he will face unexpected challenges and needs to discover his hidden potential. The only question remaining is, will it be enough to overcome the mighty demons and evil entities on his way?<br>That is up to you to find out!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1344520/extras/9cba9f00fc39e2513cfc0e19e90e29a4.avif?t=1734641151\" width=620 height=124 /></span><br><br>The fights in Apprentice Arriving are dynamic and they can get very tough, you can dodge, use Magic &amp; Combos and fight with various sword types. Tactics can be more effective than pure force so you will see that running on the blunt will most likely not lead to success.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>How does the new update differ from the previous version released in 2020?</strong></h2>To put it simple, literally in all aspects. The new version completely transforms the game which means there is pretty much nothing we have not touched and polished. We finally created the original planned <strong>Aclendi Woods</strong> with not only bumped up graphics and more straight forward level design. Eventhough this map is just the first level in the game it is already massive with a lot of areas to explore and secrets to unravel. At the moment you can play the first part of the level and before long we will unlock the next area that will offer many new challenges!<br><br>Every single feature has either been heavily improved, removed or replaced by one that fits much better to the game. But we have also added numerous features to make the overall gameplay way more fluent and most importantly, more fun! Long story short, Team Jewel Seeker invites you to experience the path of Apprentice Arriving that will be full of unforgettable moments. Follow us and see how the game is becoming exactly what we have envisioned it.<br><br>If you want to know more about how we started improving and transforming the game.
