    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >      This game is meant to be played on controller only.  Mouse and keyboard are used to navigate the UI.  Hockey Club is an up to 6v6 PvP, team based, ice hockey game where each player will choose one of six positions to play as and control.  Skaters fully control their stick with the right joystick with or without the puck.  Shots and passes are aimed with the left joystick.  This left joystick also moves the skater (and goalie too).  A skater who has the puck may perform a deke by moving the right joystick in one direction, then holding the left bumper to release control of the puck while moving the right joystick in the opposite direction to send a now detached puck in that direction along with the stick.  Then once the stick is as close to the puck as possible release the left bumper to pick up the puck again.  Once you've done this, you have now successfully completed a deke.  Skaters who don't have the puck can control their pokechecks by holding the left bumper button and moving their right joystick in the desired location.  Skaters who wish to deflect a shot with their stick can simply hit the R3 button to enable stick off ice mode.  This mode enables the skater to now move the right joystick in an up and down range of motion in order to deflect the puck.  Goalies can control their glove by holding the left bumper and moving the right joystick in the desired direction.  The goalie's blocker is controlled by holding the right bumper and moving the right joystick.  The rest of the game's controller inputs and what they do can be found in the in-game player help menu.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >        As you have probably figured out by now, this is a very skill focused and highly controllable game.  No assist or AI is added to this game.  Players are encouraged to practice.  This isn't an easy game to play.  It is designed to be competitive.  It was at first difficult even for the developers, but we wanted to make a game that, as much as possible, was based on player skill. As such, with practice, the developers got better and we believe so can you.  When you make a series of plays that result in an outstanding gameplay event, in our opinion, you will know it is entirely based upon the skill and practice of your ability resulting in what we feel encapsulates the great game of ice hockey.  So with that said, squad up with your friends.  Face off against the randoms on the other side and may the best team win.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Current features include:</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Per position skater build customizations  (height/weight affect speed and hitting power).</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Different skate blade radius choices affect top speed and agility</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Stick blade curve choices affect shot elevation/power and deking speed</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Custom jersey number, player name, and per position jersey stripe color</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Full-range control stick and poke check movement with the right joystick</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Deking, back skating, sprinting, wrist and slap shots (one timers...very difficult)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Right or Left handedness for skaters</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Full-range control of the goalie glove and blocker movement</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Trade positions during intermissions only</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >No icing</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Features upcoming:</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Rank based matchmaking</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Fighting in-game and in-penalty box (There's just one great big penalty box)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >In game content (skins, celebrations, facial animations, etc.)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >More characters and character features customization</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Goalie handedness and build customization</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >More animations, sound effects, and music</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Trading in game content with other players</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Community/Dedicated Servers</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Weekend Tournaments for Prizes</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Linux implementation</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >And much more</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >It is not the intent of Boogerman Games to resemble any real life persons as this game is purely a work of fiction for entertainment purposes only.</p>",
