    "description": "The Block is a bite sized experience for city builder fans short on time / money / attention / all of the above. Each level is slightly different and can be completed in a matter of minutes. This demo is a short timed version to give you a quick taste of what The Block will offer when it launches later this year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike my last project The Ramp, The Block is designed more as a ‘digital toy’ than a game: a short, satisfying experience that’ll make your day a little bit better and costs less than a slice of pizza.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCHOOSE from a variety of levels and sizes!<br />\r\nCREATE a tiny city block from randomly generated parts!<br />\r\nBASK in the glory of your adorable creation!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanks for checking out my page! If you have any questions or feedback, I’m all ears.",
