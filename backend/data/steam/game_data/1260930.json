Each level has a monkey standing on top of the scales. You have to keep the equilibrium by launching objects, passing below on a conveyor, onto the scales. All locations have unique sets of objects to which weight, shown as a number, has been assigned. As the objects appear from both sides of the screen at the same time, you move the cursor below an object and press a key to launch it. At the top of each scale, the current weight is shown. If there is a big gap in weight, the monkey will slowly slide to the heaviest side. <br><br>When it falls down, the game is over...",
