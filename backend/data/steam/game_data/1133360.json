If you fail a particular obstacle you get another chance at the beginning of your next run to tackle that obstacle before the sequence switches back to random!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1133360/extras/fd55b0115f7d9ce42949ebfe630a1e50.avif?t=1756149862\" width=616 height=90 /></span><br>Features<br>- Challenging wall jumping game mechanic<br>- 1 click to jump<br>- 20 Obstacles<br>- 22 Characters<br>- 3 Boats/Ships<br>- 63 Steam Achievements<br>- Steam Cloud Save<br><br>Notes: currently there is only mouse support for interacting with the menu system<br><br>Trailer Music: Onwards! by Kevin Mueller find his awesome music on Newgrounds",
