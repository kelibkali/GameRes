Explore the outer space colonies, battle in scenarios, and take on bosses while unlocking upgrades and slowly gaining strength to take on bigger foes. <br><br>In the Hyper Strike universe a force known as The Collective has attacked humanity. It is unknown where they are from but it is clear they want any and all technology to add to their forces. Humanity was able to beat them back from the core established planets. The outer systems are now serving as a refuge for The Collective as they regroup and rebuild. It is up to you to clear them out and defend humanity while the weakened core forces recover!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Unlock and Upgrade Fighter Ships!</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1527120/extras/63aaffd974fe97ea36638b71ada66a0a.poster.avif?t=1665433532\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1527120/extras/63aaffd974fe97ea36638b71ada66a0a.webm?t=1665433532\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1527120/extras/63aaffd974fe97ea36638b71ada66a0a.mp4?t=1665433532\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Explore the Outer Systems as You Clear Out The Collective Menace!</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1527120/extras/ed1529628cecd0b329c87b348cc62229.poster.avif?t=1665433532\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1527120/extras/ed1529628cecd0b329c87b348cc62229.webm?t=1665433532\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1527120/extras/ed1529628cecd0b329c87b348cc62229.mp4?t=1665433532\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Fight in Procedurally Generated Scenarios, Gain Credits and Find Upgrades!</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1527120/extras/a179e686df0101fc09fd1ca16681c986.poster.avif?t=1665433532\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1527120/extras/a179e686df0101fc09fd1ca16681c986.webm?t=1665433532\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1527120/extras/a179e686df0101fc09fd1ca16681c986.mp4?t=1665433532\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Use Credits You Earn to Buy Upgrades and Repair!</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1527120/extras/e9cff4b54dbc52fe5691b39a9effb9df.poster.avif?t=1665433532\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1527120/extras/e9cff4b54dbc52fe5691b39a9effb9df.webm?t=1665433532\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1527120/extras/e9cff4b54dbc52fe5691b39a9effb9df.mp4?t=1665433532\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Classic on rails gameplay with twin stick twist!<br></li><li>Unlock, upgrade, and customize your Ship with various colors for your own style. <br></li><li>Procedurally generated systems and scenarios.<br></li><li>Boss battles!
