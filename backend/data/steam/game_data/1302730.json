In more ways than I can count, I was both looking to extract meaning from my circumstances and reassure myself that things could get better. My best friend, Alaric Qin, helped me a lot during that difficult time. I would later ask him to compose the music, which ( lucky for me and you ) he accepted.<br><br><br>What began as a personal project has grown organically over time, and it has personally helped me enough to consider sharing it with the world. My hope is that someone out there finds tranquility or the motivation to continue persevering through playing this game. It isn't perfect, but then again, nothing ever is. It can get a  little tough at times, but so can life.<br><br>Hang in there. <br>You're not alone.<br><br>Love,<br>Nick Oueijan<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1302730/extras/419974f3fbca727e333b90aed58ee3e2.poster.avif?t=1759452600\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1302730/extras/419974f3fbca727e333b90aed58ee3e2.webm?t=1759452600\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1302730/extras/419974f3fbca727e333b90aed58ee3e2.mp4?t=1759452600\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Bright Lights &amp; Photosensitivity:</h2> This game will occasionally display bright/flashing lights.",
