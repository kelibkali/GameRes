    "description": "--------------------------[ Update - 2020 ]-------------------------------------<br><br>A lot of life has happened since the last update... There are some player security and legal concerns about the content and function of GridCrack that are keeping it from being released. The embedded browser has some serious security problems and including any 3rd party site content requires some abstraction to be completely legal. I'd love to go wild west and just drop it today but these are problems that must be solved before I put anyone at risk. Thanks for your understanding.<br><br>--------------------------[ Message From: @laserWzzrd ]--------------------------<br><br>&gt;&gt; As a GridGuardian you'll defend|secure|upgrayedd the local nodes of cyber-cities all over the globe, making the net safe and free for all users &gt;&gt; by coordinating your efforts with top keyboard cowbois and white hat wearing digininjas you can take the fight to crime orgs, governments and megacorps (what's the diff) that take more than they deserve of our precious Grid - it belongs to all of us, time for us to let them know it. <br><br><br>----------------------------------[ Description ]--------------------------------------<br><br>gridCrack VR is a trip through cyberspace plunging you right into the living internet, using the structure of live web pages to generate gameplay focused on saving The Grid - our new shared digital experience.
