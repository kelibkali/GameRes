We spent a lot of time making this videogame and our parents are very proud of us and our friend Peter said it is a good game so it doesn’t matter what you think and we’re not going to change anything.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/961450/extras/ada86937cd97a48ecd77df352a658633.avif?t=1689967121\" width=600 height=68 /></span>",
