Through asymmetric gameplay, the mercenaries will run Search and Destroy missions to hopefully root out the rebels, while the rebels themselves work to raid their enemies and liberate the country from the dictatorship's army of mercenaries.<br><br>Or if neither side is able to achieve a decisive victory, the players controlling the most regions or states will decide the victors.<br><br>And if you're more of a pacifist, you can even win without firing a shot in anger.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>28 Unique Factions<br></li><li>19 Unique Maps<br></li><li>Custom Faction Creator</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Reconquista Mode</h2>Create your own faction to fight against an army of mercenaries across 18 maps in a roguelike campaign across Latin America.<br><br>As you liberate more regions, you can further develop your own faction into a unique fighting force of your own.<br><br>Just be sure not to fail, or else you'll have to start all over again.",
