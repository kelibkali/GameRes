    "description": "A classic Orbx destination developed by Jarrad Marshall, Eagle County has been brought to life for Aerofly FS 2 Flight Simulator!<br><br>Located in the heart of the Colorado Rockies, Eagle-Vail is famous for both it's dramatic scenery, as well as it's dangerous approach. Surrounded by difficult terrain and prone to bad weather, KEGE is a high-altitude airport that will test even seasoned pilots. This scenery covers an enormous chunk of the surrounding mountains; explore the ski resorts of Vail, Eagle, Gypsum, Avon and Beaver Creek, test your hand-flying amongst the peaks of the Sawatch Range, and mix it up amongst the mesas and hidden valleys of Eagle County.<br><br>The airport itself is served by aircraft up to B757 in size; the notorious weather and difficult approach will test even the most seasoned pilots. In addition to KEGE, this scenery package also includes two addition lite airstrips; Gypsum Creek Ranch, and the 1980s-era Avon STOLport.<br><br>Eagle-Vail has been painstakingly optimised to make the most out of the Aerofly FS 2 engine. Crisp terrain textures, extremely dense vegetation, 3D night lighting, animations and sloped runways are just a few of the features you can expect to see. Additionally, KEGE has been colour-matched to blend with the surrounding Aerofly Colorado freeware DLC, ensuring a seamless transition to surrounding locations such as Denver and Aspen. All of this is combined with AFS2's famously high performance, to ensure the most immersive experience for both traditional and VR simmers.<br><br><strong>Key Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Highly-detailed rendition of KEGE<br></li><li>Massive 1500sqkm coverage area<br></li><li>Incredible ground textures at 30/60cm<br></li><li>2x bonus lite airfields<br></li><li>Gypsum Creek Ranch &amp; Avon STOLPort<br></li><li>Amazing sloped runway<br></li><li>Ultra-dense vegetation cultivation<br></li><li>Hand-placed buildings for entire coverage area<br></li><li>Animated PeopleFlow2 technology<br></li><li>3D night lighting<br></li><li>Detailed and fps-friendly grass<br></li><li>Animated airport vehicles<br></li><li>Many landmarks and POI<br></li><li>Terrain colour-blended to surrounds<br></li><li>Unique building textures<br></li><li>Dozens of custom aircraft &amp; GSE<br></li><li>Runway and taxiway lighting<br></li><li>100% compatible with Colorado DLC<br></li><li>Developed by ORBX Simulation Systems</li></ul>",
