    "description": "Cybermonk is a competitive multiplayer take on classic block pushing puzzles, a geometric brain teaser that takes sacrifice to win.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo clans face off in tense, rapid-fire matches in a temple lit up by scorching lasers. Players move and rotate mirrors to reflect the lasers, chaining them together to connect with their clan’s power portal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first clan to fully charge their portal is proven righteous, while the other has failed their god.",
