There's a <strong>milk-worshipping cult</strong> too and they're also pretty upset.<br><br></li><li><strong>10 story levels</strong> set in, around, and underneath the city of Sheffie, plus two (currently) endless-wave arena levels, and a handful of not-very-good bonus levels.<br><br></li><li>Blast your enemies with an arsenal of <strong>&quot;&quot;&quot;UK-Legal&quot;&quot;&quot; weaponry</strong> such as the <strong>Applicator</strong> - a scoped, long-range tampon applicator; the <strong>7-Barrel Sh*tgun</strong>; the <strong>Crossbowner</strong> - a silicone-shootin' crossbow designed for the bedroom; the <strong>Stigmatic 77,000</strong> - a high-power, high rate-of-fire nailgun; and many more!!!<br><br></li><li>Master various bodily functions and fast-paced movement to stay alive!! <strong>Strafe-running</strong>, <strong>unlocked vertical aiming</strong> (okay that one isn't crucial at all but feels cool/stupid) and <strong>poop-jumping</strong> will keep you one step ahead of your foes. <strong>Pee on command</strong> to put out fires (even ones on yourself!), incapacitate certain enemies, or just draw pretty pictures on walls. Make sure to eat lots of food to keep your poop meter full - you'll need it not only to stock your Sh*tgun, but to double jump too!<br><br><strong>Needless amounts of interactivity </strong>and detail in parts of the game that really don't matter!!!! Stick a fork in a plug socket and get zapped! Flush toilets! Talk to pedestrians! Ride shopping carts! Take a poop the size of a bus! <br><br></li><li><strong>Six difficulty levels</strong>: &quot;flaccid&quot;, &quot;Semi&quot;, &quot;Hard&quot;, &quot;Knotty&quot;, &quot;<i>RAGING</i>&quot;, and &quot;dysfunction&quot; - the latter of which randomises much of the game's content such as the rotation of level geometry, weapon functionality, movement, and more; making it potentially much easier to complete a level, or perhaps impossible.<br><br></li><li><strong><i>Replayability!!!</i></strong> Try a <strong>pacifist run</strong> where you don't kill anything! Or blow off some steam trying to get a <strong>pass-a-fist run</strong> where you ensure <strong>everything is dead<strong>. For a unique and honestly really annoying challenge, attempt a <strong>vegan run</strong>!! There's also an endless wave-based arena mode with its own arenas, a card-picking system for powerups and powerdowns, and some unique enemy variants!<br><br></strong></strong></li><li>An original soundtrack by General Mumble, sc.Dave!, ipi, Koa, and more; spanning all sorts of genres from metal to ambient to reggae to... *checks wikipedia...* s-...scrumpy &amp; western. <br><br></li><li> <strong>BIG-ASS CLIFFHANGER ENDING</strong> that will make you BEG us to do a sequel. Eggwife is a complete, even a bit overwhelming, gaming experience but the saga doesn't end there. Like all the great stories told by humanity - The Old Man and the Sea, Jersey Shore,  The Hobbit. and such - it leaves room for the plot to continue and characters to return. </li></ul><br><strong><i>Do you have what it takes to help 77p egg find love once again?</i></strong> Just making sure you don't forget that's what this game is about.",
