    "description": "Fear of flying is a fear of being on a flying vehicle during flight. This program allows the user to experience a flight on a passenger plane and get used to the different phases of a flight. The therapist controls when the plane takes off and lands, as well as the amount of turbulence. There is also a teleport button that immediately places the plane back on the landing strip without first going through the landing sequence.",
