Nobody comes out to greet you, <strong>the Inspector</strong>. <br>You have arrived a little bit ahead of schedule, you see. The performance hasn't properly started yet, but it shouldn't discourage you. The puppets obey you, the backstage responds to your suggested script, isn't that enough of a prove that you're allowed to be here?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1641690/extras/cy_gif_dungeon.gif?t=1726402720\" /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1641690/extras/5c1676cdd20882c2df04954962ae40fe.webp?t=1726402720\" width=600 height=52 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Card combos:</strong> rooms affect each other in many surprising ways. Find out how you can utilize it to develop your own winning strategy or make your runs more challenging. But beware: some patterns may prove to be too difficult if you rush ahead.<br></li><li><strong>Indirect battle system:</strong> strategy and preparation are the key to success. Plan your way carefully, exploit the rooms' mechanics, manage your stamina, watch the cooldowns, but feel free to stop the scene anytime to give yourself some space to breathe.<br></li><li><strong>Limited resources:</strong> the Barmaid hasn't experimented with the drinks much, the Puppeteer is just starting to work on the dolls, the Architect clearly doesn't trust you, so your own resources will be quite limited. Can you conquer the backstage despite that?</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1641690/extras/cy_gif_preparation.gif?t=1726402720\" /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1641690/extras/965a5751bc667330d36343da9c1ae4fb.webp?t=1726402720\" width=600 height=52 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Cast sneak peek:</strong> meet some of the residents of the Mansion. Their personalities can be difficult to work with, and your goals might not always align, but they will most certainly warm up to you given time and a little bit of effort.<br></li><li><strong>Lore hunt:</strong> while this prologue serves as a standalone experience, it contains tiny snippets of lore and background information for the main game, as well as explains some of the changes that happened to the characters behind the scenes.  <br></li><li><strong>The Wish:</strong> your slow incremental growth has a purpose, of course. What will you do when you finally meet the one you've been searching for? Did you prepare enough? It <i>is</i> a prologue after all, so it cannot end well... right?</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1641690/extras/cy_gif_char.gif?t=1726402720\" /></span>",
