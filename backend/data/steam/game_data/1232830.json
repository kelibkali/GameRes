    "description": "<strong>Boyandbox</strong> is a skill based puzzle platformer where you use a teleporting box to solve problems. The box can be used both as a platform for you to jump off of, as well as a shield to protect you from enemies. The game requires skill and precision. However, most of the levels have multiple solutions and the game always lets you take a step back to figure out the most optimal path.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features </h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Over 50 unique and challenging levels.<br></li><li> 6 different areas, each with their own soundtrack.<br></li><li> Blue blobs.<br></li><li> Red blobs.<br></li><li> A boy.<br></li><li> A box.</li></ul>",
