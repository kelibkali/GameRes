    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Which Sea Is This?</strong> is a local co-op sea adventure where a group of players controls a single ship together, navigating a vast and confusing ocean while trading, exploring, and occasionally turning to piracy. There is no clear map, no guaranteed direction, and no certainty that the sea you are in is the one you think it is.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >At its core, the game is about <strong>shared control and cooperation</strong>. Every player has a role to play on the same ship, and success depends on communication, coordination, and sometimes heated disagreement. Steering the ship, spotting landmarks, operating tools, or reacting to unexpected dangers all happen simultaneously, often leading to chaotic but memorable moments.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The world of <strong>Which Sea Is This?</strong> is designed to feel open, mysterious, and slightly disorienting. Seas blend into one another, landmarks repeat in unfamiliar ways, and distant silhouettes hint at places you may or may not have seen before. Exploration is driven by curiosity rather than waypoints, encouraging players to observe their surroundings and make collective decisions based on incomplete information.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The tone is light and playful, focusing on <strong>emergent co-op chaos rather than precision gameplay</strong>. Moments of wonder and discovery are balanced with humor, as the crew tries to make sense of a world that refuses to be clearly defined. Whether you are chasing riches, searching for answers, or simply arguing about which direction to sail next, the journey is always a shared one.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Local co-op gameplay for 1–4 players</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >One shared ship controlled cooperatively</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Exploration-focused open seas </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Strong emphasis on communication and teamwork</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Lighthearted tone with emergent co-op chaos</p></li></ul>",
