    "description": "Defender's Quest is a Tower-Defense/RPG Hybrid for Mac/Windows/Linux.  Think Final Fantasy Tactics meets Tower Defense. DQ tightly focuses on three things: tactical depth, customization, and story. That means no random encounters, no spikey-haired emo kids, no forced time sinks, and no tedious, repetitive battles.<br />\n<br />\nThe battle system builds off of tower defense, with individual characters taking the place of towers. Each character levels-up, learns skills, and equips gear individually, allowing the player to customize their battle experience and strategy. The overall game structure is similar to \"tactical\" RPG's, but with a real-time battle system. Game speed is adjustable, and commands can even be issued while the game is paused.<br />\n<br />\nAlso featuring an engaging character-driven story written by an actual English Major!",
