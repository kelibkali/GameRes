    "description": "Join our Discord to talk with the community and myself - <br><br> Mortem: Fallen Kingdoms is a souls-like open world RPG inspired by games such as Dragon's Dogma set in a medieval fantasy world. <br><br>Long ago magic was forbidden across the land due to corruptive power consuming it's wielders and transforming them into magic craving nightmares. The High Lord, once loyal to King, raised a rebellion with the use of magic and caused the kingdom to fall. The King has set you a task to explore the land to find the remaining magic sources and learn how to wield it's destructive power against the High Lord's armies. Players will embark on an epic adventure of exploration and face formidable foes before entering the Mortem Land. This corrupt land is the main source of the High Lord's power and you must defeat the evil that is lurking.<br><br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Craft your own abilities</strong> - Craft and customise your own abilities to match your play style<br><br></li><li> <strong>Rewarding action combat</strong> - Use your arsenal of weapons and abilities to bring down your enemies and be rewarded for your aggressive tactics. <br><br></li><li> <strong>No player classes</strong> - Customize your character to match your playstyle making use of weapon specializations and character attributes. <br><br></li><li><strong>Immersive questing</strong> - With no map markers, players must interact with NPCs to understand their objectives and direction of travel.
