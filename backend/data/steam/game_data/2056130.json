Battles play out <i>automatically</i>; characters act in initiative order, and their actions are determined by their class, formation, and enemy positioning. Archers will rain down destruction on enemies from the rear, but if they lose their cover, they're defenseless. Swordsmen will attack from the front row and must hit the enemy's front row first; from the rear, they'll do nothing. Bleddyn the bard will bravely wield his rapier from the front, or play a song to buff the entire squad from the back.<br><br>The side that deals the most morale damage - by hitting hard, taking down units, or weakening the enemy commander - is the winner, with the other side losing ground on the map.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2056130/extras/e85d282ace746a606d97351cd292673e.webp?t=1764374662\" width=480 height=60 /></span><br>Years ago, the scattered kingdoms of the Britons were nearly united by one of history's greatest princes, Llewelyn the Great, in fulfillment of an ancient prophecy. Llewelyn was the greatest ruler the land had seen since King Arthur. But when he reached the apex of his power, he died, leaving behind a messy succession crisis. And in the chaos, England invaded, leading to a loss of nearly all Llewelyn had won.<br><br>Llewelyn II was named after his famous grandfather. He too is destined for greatness and will someday be known to history. But his path to greatness is uncertain: his father and brothers are imprisoned in London, England occupies half of the territory of Gwynedd, raiders harry the coast, and the ruling prince, Llewelyn's uncle, is viewed by many as a usurper. Will he be known as the prophesied Son of Destiny who ruled over a united Kingdom of the Britons, or as the prince who lost everything when England invaded?",
