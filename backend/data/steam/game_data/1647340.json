Feedback from actual players (you guys) is extremely valuable in determining what works and what doesn't. Releasing a free demo on Steam seems like the best way to get as much feedback as possible in the shortest time.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1647340/extras/c84b8dc2bcf134fc8710c4943b4ae7ff.webp?t=1726913229\" width=439 height=28 /></span><br><br>The demo could be considered a condensed version in terms of gameplay. It includes most of the characters, skills, equipment, items and enemies that are planned for the full game. There's no plot, however, no quests, no puzzles. The game elements and locations may or may not be part of the full game. That depends on your feedback! :)<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1647340/extras/b07c1ab8774a48bdbbd4e91700ad747c.webp?t=1726913229\" width=551 height=36 /></span><br><br>Wildsilver is planned to be released in autumn 2022.
