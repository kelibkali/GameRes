    "description": "Jump from world to world searching for an interdimensional fugitive. Collect items and use them to resolve tricky situations that threaten to delay your progress.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nScenes are selected randomly and present different problems including social, investigation, combat, healing, and stealth. The right choice isn't cut and dry and items may be used to cover up after a bad idea. The story will play out differently every time and there's no way to memorize the right path so each play feels fresh.",
