The world has turned dark. A shadow government comprising of high level officers, top leaders of powerful nations and some extremely rich multinational firms have come together to create an A.I. that has taken over every aspect of human life. They have employed cybernetic beings as guards that monitor and make sure you are a &quot;good citizen&quot;, otherwise you are eliminated.<br><br>This oppressive rule soon led to a war after which we see the events of Spark Five unfold. Humans were almost wiped out, except for some colonies in moons of a certain gas giant.</strong><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/967210/extras/38ce291acc99a713db1f7362bfc23b86.avif?t=1612109950\" width=614 height=70 /></span><br><strong>This is your work in total if you buy and download the game.

You can expect a major update every couple of months instead of minor updates every week. Although the game has partial controller support, it is highly recommended to use a mouse and a keyboard for unrestricted game-play and seamless navigation. Reviews would be much appreciated.</i></li></ul>",
