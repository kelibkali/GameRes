Unlock new weapons and items by completing quests and exploring the maps, and get the sickest penguin drip by spending your hard earned money in the clothing store.<br><br>Choose stealth and complete the game without killing anyone, choose chaos and blow everything up with high-tech weaponry, or anything inbetween. No matter what level of expertise you are on, Penguin Heist will offer a challenge for everyone. If not, you can have fun slapping your friends with bananas and baguettes.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1451480/extras/13b0f0c804fb3029add9caff7ccf6273.avif?t=1744130360\" width=620 height=94 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Online CO-OP with up to 8 people playing together<br></li><li>18 very different heists with several side quests<br></li><li>Alternative game modes, such as pizza baking, zombie survival, and PvP<br></li><li>100+ quests spread across the maps<br></li><li>100+ weapons and items<br></li><li>100+ clothes and skins<br></li><li>20+ unique skins<br></li><li>Diverse playing styles from stealth to explosive chaos<br></li><li>Heist planner with custom loadouts<br></li><li>Daily challenges<br></li><li>Realistic penguin nooting</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1451480/extras/315113129eb42350092b118607ed76c0.avif?t=1744130360\" width=620 height=94 /></span><br><br>Penguin Heist features a variety of heist locations that all have their unique flair. One heist will have you stealing boats full of fish, another might have you stealing valuable works of art, and yet another may require you to kidnap an prized chef. However, it is the job of a penguin to figure out the way that they want to execute their heist. <strong>Loud</strong> or <strong>silent</strong>, <strong>lethal</strong> or <strong>non-lethal</strong> - there is no right answer... there is only the way <i>you</i> play!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1451480/extras/8003aa4bda9b080d0bb72cf2889cc971.avif?t=1744130360\" width=620 height=94 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Weapon Store</h2><br>As you progress through the game, you will unlock new weapons, tools, and items. These range from normal guns to drones to explosives to food. Each item has a special feature that can be used to complete a heist. See a pair of penguins guarding a door?
