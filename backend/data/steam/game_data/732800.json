    "description": "<strong>Turtle Quest </strong>is a game based on a baby turtle hatching from its egg and needing to get to the sea. A fun and silly game to play with your children or for all those baby turtle lovers out there!<br><br>You play the baby turtle as you negotiate obstacles and predators. You were born with a bung leg, but that doesn't hold you back in life. Your struggle is real, as are the dangers, but so is the reward.<br><br>You can play defensively by tucking in your shell and hiding under objects. <strong>Tucking into your shell will protect you from crabs. Hiding under objects will give you shelter from seagulls.</strong> Or you can go on the offense with exploding turtle poo or with baby turtle calls. That's right, little baby turtle exploding poo, because that's how it is. You can also use turtle calls to find food and go on the offensive. Either way strategy is key because like a real baby turtle, you only have one life.<br><br>As a tiny baby turtle <strong>getting stuck on objects is a possibility</strong> and means certain death as you become helpless. Sometimes, you might get lucky and struggle your way off... predators are everywhere.<br><br>Beware of your nemesis, The Seagull, he will snatch you away. <strong>If he appears your only option is to hide, or run. You will know he is around when you hear the seagull call. Befriend a fly for an extra life bonus against being eaten.</strong><br><br><u>Turtle Quest has a unique game play style. To get the most out of it, reading the in-game information in the &quot;Quest Info&quot; section is highly recommended.</u><br><br>Made by one person, over two years in the making, including a three month photography and wildlife-study expedition to the beaches of the Mornington Peninsula, Australia.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Includes local and online score system to pit your turtle skills against others.<br></li><li>Ongoing development will continue! So if you have a good idea, tell me! <i>(see community hub)</i><br></li><li>Have a good idea what you want to see in the game? Join the Turtle Quest Official Steam Group to have your input/suggestions read by the Dev.<br></li><li>44 Achievements added to show your turtle skills.<br></li><li>This game has been developed for PC (It is not a ported mobile game, nor is it designed for mobile devices.) </li></ul><br>Check out the community hub and developer's blog to keep up to date with current developments.",
