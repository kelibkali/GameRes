    "description": "<strong>CROSSNIQ+ (CROSS-neek plus)</strong> is a speed-focused, arcade-style puzzle game inspired by &quot;y2k-era&quot; visual design - a tribute to highly polished, small-scope Japanese games from the late 90's.<br><br>In CROSSNIQ+, the name of the game is re-arranging a grid of tiles to form <strong>&quot;crosses&quot; - rows and column of the same color.</strong> You can move tiles up, down, left or right - but moving them off the edge of the grid makes them wrap back to the other side, offering a unique and brain-bending challenge that's been compared to a mix between matching games and a color cube. Unlike other popular puzzle games, CROSSNIQ+ focuses on speed and technique rather than chains or combos - make crosses quickly and set up multi-crosses to earn bonuses.<br><br>In Endless mode, keep making crosses to keep your timer filled - let it hit empty, and your game is over. In Time Attack, your time is a set amount - earn as many points as you can before the buzzer sounds. Play against a friend in Versus, complete with items and special moves... or simply relax to a variety of different, aesthetically striking playfields in Chillout mode, where there's no score, timer, or game overs. No matter your playstyle, there's a mode in CROSSNIQ+ for you!<br><br><strong>Let's Cross! Aim for THE TOP!</strong>",
