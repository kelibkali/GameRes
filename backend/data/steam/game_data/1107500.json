    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > D&amp;D Classics: G2 The Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl (1E)</h2><i> Giants have been raiding the lands of men in large bands, with giants of different sorts in these marauding groups. Death and destruction have been laid heavily upon every place these monsters have visited. A party of the bravest and most powerful adventurers has been assembled and given the charge to punish the miscreant giants.</i><br>This is the original adventure G2: &quot;The Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl.&quot; Contained herein are referee notes, background information, maps, and exploration keys for the complete adventure using the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules. This adventure can be used alone or as the second in a series of adventures that includes G1: &quot;Steading of the Hill Giant Chief&quot; and G3: &quot;Hall of the Fire Giant King.&quot;<br>For characters of levels 9-10.<br><strong><br><i> We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today.

This content is presented as it was originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed.
