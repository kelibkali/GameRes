    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A classic game, reborn.</h2> <br>Multibombers is a multiplayer strategy game by Pig’s Indie Games based upon the classic Bomberman series of games. Players compete based upon a first-person field of view to be the last man standing by using bombs to destroy their competition. <br><br>Power-ups scattered around the arena encourage players to move tactically throughout each match - having to decide between making a run to the center where more power-ups are located or heading straight for enemy players - a high risk, high reward decision. <br><br>Multiplayer is available for both LAN and online play, so that there is always a way for you to play with your buddies. <br><br>In the future, Multibombers will have a cosmetic system and client-side map customization, allowing for you to personalize your own experience in any way you see fit. Steam achievements will also be added to provide extra incentive to play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What do we have included?</h2> <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> A fledged out powerup system, with an algorithm of luck, bringing more and better powerups closer to the center.<br></li><li> Multiplayer available for you to play online across the world, or locally with your buddies.<br></li><li> Satisfy all your destructive needs with our explosive system.<br></li><li> A bunch of achievements and stat-tracking to keep the game competitive, whilst still being fun.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What are we planning to add in the future?</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> We are soon going to be adding an inventory system with cosmetics.<br></li><li> Special perks for our Patrons, such as a golden nametag and tags in chat, as well as special cosmetics.<br></li><li> A singleplayer mode, featuring a dynamic tutorial.</li></ul>",
