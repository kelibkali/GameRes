In response to their seemingly endless numbers and resistance to conventional tactics, humanity developed manned bipedal machines known as Tactical Surface Fighters — a weapon system designed for the sole purpose of countering the alien threat. But TSFs alone weren't enough, and humanity has been trapped in a neverending war for decades, slowly but surely being driven to the brink of extinction.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >February, 2004: Professor Kouzuki's last-ditch gambit has failed, and Alternative IV is no more.

The alien invaders were seemingly destroyed, but at what cost?
