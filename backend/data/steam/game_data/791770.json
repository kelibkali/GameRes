The game is divided into 6 nights (<i>4 nights currently available</i>). Each night consists of two phases - <strong><i>sleeping phase</i></strong> and <strong><i>dreaming phase</i></strong>.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/791770/extras/ad944bc652c509c0e157799659c92246.poster.avif?t=1750495441\" width=616 height=346 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/791770/extras/ad944bc652c509c0e157799659c92246.webm?t=1750495441\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/791770/extras/ad944bc652c509c0e157799659c92246.mp4?t=1750495441\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>In the <strong><i>sleeping phase</i></strong> the player has to fall asleep before the clock reaches 4 am. There's an info panel that displays the player's current sleep and stress level. By closing eyes, the player can raise the sleep level and fall asleep once it has been filled up. The stress level will rise upon witnessing hallucinations. Sometimes the hallucinations can materialize as horrific monsters and if the player doesn't hide under the blanket in time, they can cause a jumpscare and increase the stress level a lot. Keeping the eyes open and turning on the light will reduce the stress level. The key for this phase is to maintain a proper balance between the sleep and stress levels.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/791770/extras/11c1d8781397cb084e334a23cf786d45.poster.avif?t=1750495441\" width=600 height=374 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/791770/extras/11c1d8781397cb084e334a23cf786d45.webm?t=1750495441\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/791770/extras/11c1d8781397cb084e334a23cf786d45.mp4?t=1750495441\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>In the <strong><i>dreaming phase</i></strong> the player gets to relive the events that led to John's current, unfortunate condition. Compared to the sleeping phase, here the player can freely roam around and explore the environment. But be careful - a dream can quickly turn into a nightmare. From walking in the woods to escaping nightmarish situations, you can never know what to expect next. And what caused the mysterious incident?... Who's behind it?... The answers lie within John's memories.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/791770/extras/5e37402b26051485caba20bee0062f05.poster.avif?t=1750495441\" width=600 height=374 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/791770/extras/5e37402b26051485caba20bee0062f05.webm?t=1750495441\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/791770/extras/5e37402b26051485caba20bee0062f05.mp4?t=1750495441\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Here's what some people say:</h2><strong>Markiplier</strong> - <i>&quot;Pretty darn good, I liked it a lot!&quot;</i><br><strong>Jacksepticeye</strong> - <i>&quot;Oh, Jesus Jesus...
