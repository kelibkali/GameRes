The game demands and rewards perfection above anything else, but if you’re willing to look, you might also find things you’re not supposed to find. Who knows, maybe you’ll even find a way to escape this system of eternal punishment?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A challenging experience</h2>You will fall into pits, you will get shot at, and some clown will probably jump on your head over and over again. The game might tell you, that you're not good enough to play it, but it's a lie!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Reliable randomness</h2>Splinter Zone doesn’t feature a true random level generation. Instead, its levels are hand-crafted, but the order in which they appear is randomly generated. This way it is still possible for you to get familiar with the game’s challenges while still having a unique experience every time you play.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/612160/extras/0909911e97ac3740303d43bc30426e3a.poster.avif?t=1767375074\" width=450 height=240 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/612160/extras/0909911e97ac3740303d43bc30426e3a.webm?t=1767375074\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/612160/extras/0909911e97ac3740303d43bc30426e3a.mp4?t=1767375074\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A combo system that rewards perfection above all else</h2>The more enemies you destroy and the less damage you take, the more devastating your attacks will get.

For those moments, Splinter Zone features a handy array of cheats that you can enable right at the start of the game.
