It works by rendering the 3D scene an X percentage higher than the physical resolution of the display and then resizing/downsampling the image back to your display. This results in an expensive form of high quality anti-aliasing that delivers a cleaner looking rendered image.<br> <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/500500/extras/450c0a5bf67c1001a0038e5e5720bd17.avif?t=1469479011\" width=550 height=270 /></span><br>You can fine tune super sampling settings in real-time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Introducing Super Enhanced Mode</h2>Simple VR Video Player is excited to introduce Super Enhanced Mode!

As a general rule of thumb, if your Windows Media Player can play the movie, so can Simple VR Video Player.<br><br>Media Foundation (Win 8/10) is a super optimized DX11 hardware accelerated decoder built into the latest versions of Windows with full h264 decoding support.<br><br>For more advanced users, you can change the video decoding engine to use another video backend such as DirectShow which allows you to use DirectShow decoders, filters, and splitters such as LAV and ffdshow.  Just choose the best decoding option for you!<br><br>* Note: The player can't play Blu-ray discs since they are DRM'd and encrypted!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >It's Simple!</h2>We wanted to create the first simple and easy to use VR video player to take advantage of the Vive and it's hand motion controls.  We also wanted to make it powerful and customizable using familiar controls.
