So why get your hands dirty when someone else can do it for you?<br><br>SoTF is a turn-based tactics game featuring a rotating roster of hypnotised heroes. Charm them with your presence, send them to their death in a blaze of glory, and compose songs to be remembered for a hundred years!<br><br>You’re not here to make friends. You’re here to write history, and you intend to be remembered in the greatest Saga ever told: “The Song of The Fae”<br><br><strong>The game is still early in development and this is our first public demo build. It includes a tutorial, a boss and free-play of content we've added so far. Let us know what you think! And follow development on twitter via @vivavolt, @iamonshushu and @twopmstudio.</strong>",
