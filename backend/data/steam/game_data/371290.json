    "description": "​In this film, through the voices of many within the industry, we discuss the benefits that video games have created for everyday people, as well as the challenges they have faced in being legitimized as art and the alleged violent and addictive qualities they are claimed to have. Along with this, we also discuss the effects of the indie community on games, and how video games are being embraced in everyday life.<br><br><br><strong>Directed by: </strong>Richard Cook<br><strong>Featuring: </strong>Adam Sessler, Kellee Santiago, Patrick Scott Patterson, David Eddings, Chris Wiseman, James Portnow, Chris Kohler, Warren Spector, Feargus Urqhart, Gordon Walton, and more.",
