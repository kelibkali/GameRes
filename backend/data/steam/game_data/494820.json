    "description": "The world is a videogame and it seems like everyone wants a piece of you! Flip them off and collect your shiny balls of green to fly through the chaos and sort this world out!<br><br>The Unison corporation really made Game development popular and literally everyone was doing it, then one day, the data leaked out of the computers into the ground. It concentrated into acid, and things started to go weird. Now you find yourself in this videogame world where this Acid has raised the dead! If you want to survive, you'll have to use your grav gun to &quot;raise&quot; them a little bit more, flipping them into the sky and then smashing them into the ground!  Either that, or flip yourself up onto the building to make a quick getaway!<br><br>How did the Acid get out of the computers?  Where did this Grav Gun come from?<br>Maybe you can find out, or maybe you don't care and just want to smash xombies into the ground! <br>After all I'm sure one of them is someone who done you wrong. <br><br>There are a few ways to play.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>If you are a collector, you can focus on collecting all the antacids. <br></li><li>If you like high scoring, you can try and kill as many xombies as possible without dying and get the high score.<br></li><li>If you like adventure, you can traverse the levels and discover what has happened and who is behind it all. </li></ul>",
