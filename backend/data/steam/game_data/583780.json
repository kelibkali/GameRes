    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Dark Dimensions</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Welcome to Ravenwood, a quiet town at the edge of nowhere. A place that doesn’t appear on most maps, where the fog rolls thicker than the morning sun and the shadows seem to move when you’re not looking.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A town of stories—strange ones that could just as easily happen to you. People vanish without a trace. Buildings stand empty, yet footsteps follow you down their halls. Take a photo and your phone may flicker with glimpses of worlds that shouldn’t exist. Lights blaze in lighthouses long after their keepers have gone. And sometimes, time itself slips—minutes stretch, hours repeat, whole nights fracture into something you can’t explain.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Each story is another fragment of the truth, another step deeper into the Dark Dimensions.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Dark Dimensions: The Last Shift</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >It was supposed to be simple: one last night on duty. Just you, a flashlight, and the echo of tools left behind in a half-renovated hotel. The place is empty, at least that’s what they told you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >But as the hours drag on, the silence feels heavier than it should. Corridors stretch longer than you remember. Doors stand slightly ajar, as if waiting for you to look inside. The building groans like it’s alive, and sometimes… you’re sure something is walking just out of sight.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >One more shift, they said. Just make it to morning.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Dark Dimensions is an anthology of atmospheric horror stories, all set in and around the town of Ravenwood. Each episode stands on its own, but every thread connects to a deeper mystery hidden in the town’s shadows.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Genre</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >First-person psychological horror</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Narrative-driven exploration</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Light survival and puzzle elements</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Episodic anthology structure</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Each game offers a focused, story-rich experience designed to be played in a single sitting. You’ll explore detailed environments, uncover unsettling clues, and confront the unknown—all while being drawn deeper into the strange and shifting reality of Ravenwood.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Welcome to Ravenwood.
