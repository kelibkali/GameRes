    "description": "Hello User,<br>You might already know us since the previous program <strong>WPD</strong>. In this project our goal is to create the best tool for quick Windows customization! Quite ambitious considering there are dozens of programs like this already out there, ha-ha. Yet we still have a couple of aces up the sleeve. <br><br><strong>DashboardX</strong> includes an identical privacy module as in <strong>WPD</strong>, plus many new improvements that are already available or planned for release.<br><br>Here are a few of them:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>UI</strong><br>We think that we have made a pretty cool interface, and, of course, we will continue to improve it.<br></li><li><strong>Presets</strong><br>Yes, now you can create and load presets directly from the main menu.<br></li><li><strong>Favorites</strong><br>A category where you can add frequently used switches.<br></li><li><strong>Search</strong><br>When you have a huge list of switches - search is simply necessary.<br></li><li><strong>Observer</strong><br>Keeps track of changes to privacy settings. For example, if you disabled something in the <strong>DashboardX</strong>, and then this setting was enabled again (outside the program), the next time you start the program Observer will highlight this setting in orange. That’s pretty cool, right?<br></li><li><strong>Tweaker</strong> <i>(Shipped)</i><br>A separate section for all your non-privacy settings.<br></li><li><strong>Constructor</strong> <i>(BETA)</i><br>Probably the coolest feature allowing you to add your own switches! <br><i>*This feature is in beta testing on the Experiments tab, after that Constructor will be available on the Privacy and Tweaker tabs.</i></li></ul><br>Also:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Hidden</strong> <i>(Shipped)</i><br>Ability to hide non-used built-in switches.<br></li><li><strong>Fast load</strong> <i>(TBA)</i><br>We plan to significantly reduce the program loading time.<br></li><li><strong>Workshop</strong> <i>(TBA)</i><br>The Constructor will support Steam Workshop.</li></ul><br>And most importantly, <strong>DashboardX</strong>, like <strong>WPD</strong>, works through the Windows API, leaves no traces in the system, and all settings are reversible (unless otherwise specified in the description).",
