    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>A11: Wild Thing</strong></h2><i>The PCs are hired by the Black Gold Consortium to track down passengers of the Wasp, a ship which has wrecked somewhere in the Vast Swamp. One passenger in particular interests the Consortium more than any other: a woman named Sandalia. Sandalia is known by every citizen of Cherrians Rest as the most charming, clever, and beautiful woman in the city. She was recently hired to train as a diplomat for the powerful Black Gold Consortium. Now Sandalia has gone missing, and the Consortium wants her back.</i><br><i>What starts out as a simple rescue mission suddenly takes a turn for the worst when a love struck wild thing leads the PCs on an all-out chase through the swamp. The would-be rescuers travel through haunted bogs and fields of fire to a final confrontation which may just be the oddest thing anyone has ever experienced.</i><br><i>Also included in &quot;Wild Thing&quot;:</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Choice of three vessels with special swamp navigation rules<br></li><li>New swamp bugs and diseases<br></li><li>Incredible swamp encounter chart<br></li><li>New Monster: Bog Troll<br></li><li>New Magical Items<br></li><li>New Traps<br></li><li>Multiple ways to complete the primary quest</li></ul><i>Conversion by:</i><strong> Trevor Armstrong</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included 5E Ruleset.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Trevor Armstrong</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included 5E Compatible ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
