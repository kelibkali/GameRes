    "description": "Tabletop Adventures is meant to look and feel like an actual role-playing environment that you would setup at home and play with pen &amp; paper, dice, miniatures, map tiles, and imagination. The game uses familiar rules systems and takes you through a generated story with random changes to make things unpredictable for maximum replay-ability. Since the game is single-player, you won't have to find friends with flexible schedules in order to start playing. You control 4 heroes and partake in a voice narrated story in a video game that emulates tabletop board game actions. This is not meant to replace your favorite role-playing game, but to get you through the week while waiting for your next tabletop adventure.",
