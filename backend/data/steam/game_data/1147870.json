These are the three colors Vivid and Spirit can shift between. They can only use certain weapons or powers while a specific color. It's integral that you find methods to swapping your color, such as Stomping Colored Blocks, to utilize different abilities for different situations. This is because different Color Attacks have different properties, such as the Golden Bow shooting far but only horizontally, while the Azure Axe can be tossed far up vertically. As you progress there will be more demanding situations where certain abilities are favored over others, and figuring how to Color Swap efficiently will be the key to success!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1147870/extras/0531f7ae6e73dc131bd5d9aaa1f196b2.poster.avif?t=1620049675\" width=512 height=329 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1147870/extras/0531f7ae6e73dc131bd5d9aaa1f196b2.webm?t=1620049675\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br><u>Over 5 Different Stories!</u><br>There are multiple adventures to play from in Vivid!
