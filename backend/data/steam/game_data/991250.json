I always loved the character action genre since my childhood. Making such a game was in my mind for more than 15 years; but I never had the courage to jump into such a monumental task. After working in the industry for years; I had earned all the necessary experience over time, and one day I felt that I should just do it! Even though I would have loved to work with a team, I want to make the first game in the franchise all by myself to test myself. If people likes this game and supports me financially, I would love to expand the franchise with a sequel and a team of professionals!<br><br>You can add the game to your wishlist if you want to support me, and by doing so, you can get notified about the early access discounted sale! I don't plan on making huge discounts to the game in it's first years, and early access sale will be the cheapest you can get it to show my appreciation for the early supporters!<br><br>For those that want to see more, I'm documenting the evolution of characters in the game on my ArtStation account. Checking them might give you some ideas about the game. Here is the link for it: <br><br>Feel free to join the community over Reddit: <br><br>In future, there will be a dedicated Discord server for the game, also I will monitor Steam forums for bug reports.<br><br>Now that you know how to reach me, feel free to ask anything!",
