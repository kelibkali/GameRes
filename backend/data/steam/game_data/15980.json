Help William catch the falling leaves and transplant them on apple, pear, cherry and orange trees. Monitor the weather and help William meet his daily earnings goals.</p>                              \n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If William is able to sell enough of his fruit, fight off the caterpillars, locusts and crows, and earn enough money, then he'll be that much closer to winning over the affections of his one true love, Elizabeth Grant.</p>",
