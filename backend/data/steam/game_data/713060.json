    "description": "The Beanstalk is a virtual reality fairytale experienced based around the classic, &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk.&quot; It's a student project created by a team at BYU Provo, and now we're releasing it so that you can try it out for free.<br />\r\nGet inside, explore the world of Jack and the Giant, have fun, and be careful not to fall while climbing the Beanstalk!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the download of this game, you will get access to the complete build that we created while at BYU. It features fully immersive room-scale VR experiences including handling objects, climbing, throwing, teleportation, and even planting beans! You'll climb, you'll shrink, you'll explore and discover, you'll see the classic story told as you've never seen before!<br />\r\nThe gameplay is meant to give newcomers to VR a quick taste of the possibilities and get them hungry for more. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe hope you enjoy our work!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOh, and if you search hard enough, you might find a few Easter eggs that we left behind!",
