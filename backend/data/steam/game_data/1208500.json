The once productive robots  of  humanity’s bio-dome cities have mysteriously turned against their residents. For the good of humanity, you must retake control of these cities and save their civilians. After your spaceship docks, you strategically choose which objectives to attack, and the types of character upgrades and defenses to construct. With each objective recaptured the enemy will become more alerted to your presence and will prepare to mount a counter attack, so you'll need to choose wisely. To escape the city after completing your objective, you must protect your ship and destroy them in their final assault.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1208500/extras/ebf834ba4e921f0f83c227ffabcc2d5e.avif?t=1769704530\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1208500/extras_big/ebf834ba4e921f0f83c227ffabcc2d5e.avif?t=1769704530 width=800 height=82 /></span></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Strategize and plan your attack to recapture randomly generated cities across Saturn's moons</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Use cover, dodge with precision, and maximize your skills to overcome your robotic foes</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Battle enemies that  modulate their aggressiveness, and intelligently change their behavior based on their assessment of the fight </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Equipment, abilities, and upgrades let you to customize your character  and playstyle</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Innovative class and ability system allow deep but intuitive character building   </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Play solo or join forces in 2p co-op, where distinct characters and synergistic abilities reward teamwork and coordination</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Attempt challenging missions that let you compete with other players on a global leaderboard</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Stellar soundtrack</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >  </p>",
