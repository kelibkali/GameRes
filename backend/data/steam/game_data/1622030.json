And The Dark Lord is after you right now! No matter where you go or how much distance you travel; you will need to watch your back!<br><br>In this top down adventure you will explore through a different generated map each time you play with enemies to fight using real time combat, along with using bows and bombs!

You can find treasure and supplies through exploration along with special stamps which get added to your collection for every boss you defeat!<br><br>Only you can save the Land of Hexile from this evil, but it won't be easy as you will have to fight through the world against all the craziness that it has to offer!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1622030/extras/153c767a304fb2d13313277366d15e05.avif?t=1759503681\" width=616 height=80 /></span><br><br>There are many forces that will try to stop you!
