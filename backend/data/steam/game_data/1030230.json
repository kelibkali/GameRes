    "description": "<strong>Overhauled and updated to TRS19 Standards</strong><br><br>At the confluence of the Kicking Horse and Columbia rivers lies Golden, British Columbia. At K.C.Junction just north of town, two Canadian Pacific Railway subdivisions also converge. The CPR Mountain Sub between Revelstoke and Field is part of the transcontinental main line connecting eastern Canada and it's west coast. The CPR Windermere Sub between Fort Steele in the east and the town of Golden is part of an important coal export corridor. <br><br>Coal has long been a big part of CP Rail's business and a 1960's increase in Japanese demand led to a continuous procession of unit coal trains heading west from mines in southern Canada to the sea at Vancouver. The traffic continues around the clock to this day. CP Rail facilities at Golden are used to manage coal trains coming off the Windermere Sub onto the main line westward and serve as an inspection point and maintenance depot for the enormous fleet of coal hoppers taking up the unrelenting strain.<br><br>Other than coal trains, the east-west Mountain Sub also sees heavy intermodal traffic, in no small part thanks to CP's growing relationship with China; plus a variety of other trains including VIA Rail passenger services and the Rocky Mountaineer's seasonal exursions.<br><br>On the Windermere Sub, coal is king but grain and potash haulage is common and there are daily local freights between Golden and Cranbrook. It's also part of the exquisite Royal Canadian Pacific's scenic circuit.<br><br>TRS19 update includes:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>New Track<br></li><li>New Scenery<br></li><li>4 x new sessions<br></li><li>New detail rolling stock</li></ul>",
