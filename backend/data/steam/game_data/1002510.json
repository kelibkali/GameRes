Indifferent, weird, and expressionless, he’s everything that Eloise would normally define as ‘unreliable’. Yet, little by little, she finds herself opening up to this odd and mysterious character named Steve. She even comes to believe that maybe everything will be alright from now on. <br><br><i>That is, until she found a weird note concerning her parents’ deaths next to the garbage bin.</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 60k words story</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Original Soundtrack</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Kinetic novel</li></ul>",
