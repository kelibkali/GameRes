    "description": "Island Town is a one man made project that was created as a learning experience for game development, this is a game/demo with few things to enjoy. The game is a third person shooter zombie survival with aspects from many other genres including survival, sandbox, open world and few others. The game features 4 weapons, 6 cars, 3 dimensions of the same map, two dimensions with over 200 zombies throughout the map, and one daytime dimension with no zombies to explore. The game has many places to visit and interact, for example the gun store offers ammo to buy for your weapons, the hospital offers  health and powers to run fast and jump extremely high.
