    "description": "You wake up among the trees. Your head hurts and it's cold here. You see you bag on the grass, you pick it up, empty... All this feels like a bad dream. But it's not a dream.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIdea<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDo you remember those horror flash games? Early quests? Well this is the idea.<br />\r\nNowadays everyone wants to sell games with ultra-high graphics, which requires a lot of DLC to get a well-made game.<br />\r\nBut we want to bring you a story. A story that you can feel without super graphics or paying a lot of money. We want you to go through the game interested and thrilled.<br />\r\nWe hope you like this game, so we could encourage ourselves to make the second part.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHint<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- If you're confused about the story, maybe you can find an answer in a chest.<br />\r\n- Your actions may lead you to a dead end.<br />\r\n- Don't forget to save, there is no autosave (old times!)<br />\r\n- Don't be afraid to start over again.",
