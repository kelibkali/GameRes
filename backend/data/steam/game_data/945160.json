He needs them. At any cost. Deciding to record his journey to another world with the Grim Reaper, he hopes he can create the most trending, most liked, most hyped video of all time.<br><br>Unfortunately for Angelo, that world is <strong>Hell.</strong> And it’s inhabited by people with more than a few problems, who will need his help.<br><br>Make a visit to the <strong>Devil</strong> himself! But be careful because... well…you'll see.<br><br>In Hell, <strong>Angelo</strong> won’t be traveling alone. Even a blogger needs a sidekick.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What you can expect:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Expressive and somehow slightly familiar characters<br></li><li> A helluva great looking game with lots of levels, but no pixel art!<br></li><li> Addictive and mind-blowing puzzles. This game makes you think (unlike other games)!<br></li><li> Not pixel art graphics! (in case you missed the line above)<br></li><li> Funny dialogue. A cocktail of humor and philosophy; delivered in snappy soundbites! <br></li><li> Too many cocktails are harmful, so our lines are sophisticated. Making you smile and think at the same time by using only a few words (like now)<br></li><li> You won’t forget these characters’ lines, even if you try. Each character has their own issues. (Who doesn’t have issues, right?)<br></li><li> <strong>WARNING!!!</strong> There is a chance you’ll like it in Hell and won’t be scared anymore</li></ul>",
