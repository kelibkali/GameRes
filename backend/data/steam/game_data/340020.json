P. Lovecraft, (The Call of Cthulhu) Raymond Chandler, (The Big Sleep) Dashiel Hammet (Red harvest). There is also a great work of reference on several Occult authors. Such as Aleister Crowley, Eliphas Levi, Papus and even Cornelius Agrippa. And when we say inspiration, it means that the game is not a transcript of any of these authors plays but aims, by the combination of this mixture of elements, to achieve something new and flesh, I mean, fresh.",
