    "description": "In a faraway kingdom, it was discovered one certain kind of magical energy extracted from strange elemental portals that appeared on the land. Obsessed with the power, the ruler of the land, The Monarch, was abused by the magical portals and the creatures that lived in these strange worlds that the portals led. Various researches were made until, one day, everything collapses. A massive explosion happens and the castle of The Monarch was partially destroyed and trapped in an alternated dimension between the realms that the portals gave access.<br><br>You don't remember your past, who you used to be, or if one day you were something. The only thing you know is that the dungeon summons you, calls you, and you are lured for it.  With the ability to use the elemental energy that led the kingdom to ruins fight the monsters that now habit the inner castle and make your way to the last of the floors of the castle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Explore Interdimensional Dungeons</strong></h2><br>In Soul Shifter the player is placed in the role of a strange boy who ends up venturing into different portals exploring what was once the ancient castle of one of the most powerful kingdoms that history has ever known.<br><br>The castle's outer layers became ruins, yet the portals created by the explosion were no longer closed. Now strange creatures come out of the portals and exhibit the natures of an unknown world, along with this the main regions of the castle were trapped in a space-time mess, with rooms being repositioned at all times and the lack of a minimally defined temporal continuity.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Discover the secrets of a place lost in space-time</strong></h2><br>The regions belonging to the castle have now become a confusing prison, their rooms are full of creatures and ancient inhabitants of the castle, driven by madness and succumbed to elemental energy. Despite all this, however, some former inhabitants of the castle remain there, living in a random prison that constantly defies their own sanity.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Use magical powers and find out about your history</strong></h2><br>The main character can absorb the powers left by the souls of the Elemental Lords. Use this to your advantage and create effective combinations and strategies to combat the challenges you face<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1452910/extras/7cec7d3a13c8de3bccb22e5382cec96c.apng?t=1689810152\"><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1452910/extras/7cec7d3a13c8de3bccb22e5382cec96c.poster.avif?t=1689810152\" class=\"bb_img\" width=120 height=120 /></picture></span> <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1452910/extras/85f171d49fd8c9aeefaa1cb7c26e8f3d.apng?t=1689810152\"><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1452910/extras/85f171d49fd8c9aeefaa1cb7c26e8f3d.poster.avif?t=1689810152\" class=\"bb_img\" width=120 height=120 /></picture></span> <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1452910/extras/82f52ea9cc89b5e4ff441446c54ff831.apng?t=1689810152\"><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1452910/extras/82f52ea9cc89b5e4ff441446c54ff831.poster.avif?t=1689810152\" class=\"bb_img\" width=120 height=120 /></picture></span> <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1452910/extras/4d3706e617c7423423aa05414c9e2807.apng?t=1689810152\"><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1452910/extras/4d3706e617c7423423aa05414c9e2807.poster.avif?t=1689810152\" class=\"bb_img\" width=120 height=120 /></picture></span> <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1452910/extras/cd9c82c9fe020a9787123170aec33407.apng?t=1689810152\"><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1452910/extras/cd9c82c9fe020a9787123170aec33407.poster.avif?t=1689810152\" class=\"bb_img\" width=120 height=120 /></picture></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Play with your friends</strong></h2><br>The entire Soul Shifter campaign can (and perhaps should) be played with two players, both of whom have access to elemental powers and have a story for which the dungeon summons them.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1452910/extras/5e2ec66092d6961759c73bd010691eac.avif?t=1689810152\" width=430 height=160 /></span>",
