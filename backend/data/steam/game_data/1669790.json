    "description": "Biocide takes place on Karver Island. You have been hired by a rival company of Celledyne a global leader in pharmaceutical and biogenetics. Your mission is to infiltrate the facility on Karver Island and recover data linked to experiments done by Celledyne. As well as locate a rogue scientist who has been selling research and secrets to the highest bidder.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBiocide plays much like the recent Resident Evil remakes with an inventory and combat system that mirrors it closely. The game is full of puzzles, tense moments, and lore inspired by some of my favorite classic horror games. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy love letter to survival horror games. Some of my favorite games growing up were survival horror games like Resident Evil, Dead Space, Silent Hill, ect.  This is the first game I've made with a serious approach and wish to see it through to completion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe full release will be coming in May 2022.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you :)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeel free to try out the Demo for Biocide linked on this Steam Store page.<br />\r\nTested on<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGraphics Card: GTX 1070<br />\r\nProcessor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-9600K CPU @ 3.70GHz<br />\r\nInstalled Ram: 16 GB<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFPS capped at 70fps",
