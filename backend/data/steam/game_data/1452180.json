    "description": "<strong>Still Light Version 4</strong><br>Still Light is a horrifying, dark first-person experience. Explore the unknown on your own, or with other adventurers. You should stay in the still light, otherwise, your decision may lead to a less fortunate ending. If playing with others, we would recommend sticking together. <br><br><i>Renovate Software has been working on this project for over a year and the game has been released in Early Access, however, <strong>Update 4</strong> will bring massive features to the game and make it even more terrifying. We have decided to bring Still Light to Steam in order to provide our players with easier updates and more features. </i><br><br><strong>New features in the game include:</strong><br>- Realtime Multiplayer<br>- Voice Communication<br>- Voice Recognition<br>- Artificial Intelligence &amp; Terrifying Ways To Interact<br>- Randomly Selected Objectives<br>- Realtime Player Data (Vitals, Nickname etc)<br><i>And much, much more..</i>",
