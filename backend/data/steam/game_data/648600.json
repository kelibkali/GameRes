    "description": "FINAL FANTASY XV WINDOWS EDITION MOD ORGANIZER is a tool to help you make mods for the FINAL FANTASY XV WINDOWS EDITION. It allows you to convert your assets into mod data and incorporate them into the game world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main function of MOD ORGANIZER is building model data and uploading mods to Steam Workshop. It does not have the functionality for creating and editing assets such as 3D models. Please create assets with your own tools and output them in FBX format, which MOD ORGANIZER can then import.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour mods can be uploaded to Steam Workshop if you have a Steam account, and then shared with the community. Subscribe to Steam Workshop's mod data to use the mods in the Steam version of FINAL FANTASY XV WINDOWS EDITION.",
