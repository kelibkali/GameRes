Skirmishers harass and keep watch for enemy ambushers. Cavalry speeds around the flanks, crushing enemies severed off from the horde. Every unit has it's use. Here's a sneak peek of just a few:<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1113300/extras/fff3c6a3fa6838d1f243045cfac9411d.avif?t=1564593379\" width=620 height=300 /></span><br>The backbone of any city-fighting army. Tough and dangerous. But Soldiers are slow and vulnerable when the situation calls for speed and adaptability. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1113300/extras/14e2799b87716716ea0e950d59d03e49.avif?t=1564593379\" width=620 height=300 /></span><br>While Spearman can't dole-out the demon death dealing as mightily as Soldiers, there is no better choice of infantry unit if you need to cover ground fast. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1113300/extras/c094ecdaeeabfdb2f377afaa3ab4fd8b.avif?t=1564593379\" width=620 height=300 /></span><br>The real problem with demons is that they just stink beyond all reason. Good to keep your distance. Ballista is the perfect tool for impaling a black demon heart from about three hexes away. Very handy, but rare.

Normally peaceable, but since the Demon Army took to Evil Crusade, the Headless Men have been acting up. They aren't too dangerous - unless they get you surrounded. Beware the ambush.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1113300/extras/aeab86e858f897877c4552dadaa78d14.avif?t=1564593379\" width=620 height=300 /></span><br>There seems to be several varieties of imps. All of them are pains in the arse. But Imp Riders....you're gonna hate these guys. They're faaast and they got a dangerous skirmish attack.

A big, ugly beast atop a bigger uglier beast, which is charging way faster than anything that huge has right to. You'll need armor defeating capability and advantageous terrain. Even still, expect casualties.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1113300/extras/442feb18d5beb1a72ed0237041bc0396.avif?t=1564593379\" width=620 height=100 /></span><br><strong>Two distinct, single-player campaigns</strong>:<br><br><strong> The Adventure Campaign</strong> follows a band of brigands who mix up with one of the last godly men capable of fighting back the hordes of hell. Stinky-cheese voice acting with Monty Python-esque quips will cool down the inferno somewhat, but the action builds into epic, hour+ long battles. Please, stay hydrated.<br><br><strong>The Strategy Campaign</strong> gives a no-nonsense nose dive right into old school strategy. The armies are smaller and the battles shorter, meaning every turn is critical and small mistakes are costly. Take your time and think your way through - defeat will strike fast and hard. Hardcore gamers can challenge themselves for a perfect Golden Goblet playthrough. Be ready to punch that restart button in sweaty revenge!<br><br>-16 Beautiful levels designed to look like detailed dioramas<br>-26 highly detailed unit figurines based on authentic early-medieval Christian art<br>-Characters gain perks and may be upgraded, allowing you to build a customized army that will be unique to each playthrough<br>-No gimmicky challenge or cheap shots. Polished, fair challenge.<br>-Simple interface. Entire game can be played using only a mouse.<br>-A game by gamers, for gamers, and for the love of gaming.<br><br><br>Note from the Developers : <i>Hail, Good Crusader!
