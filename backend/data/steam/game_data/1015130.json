The amount of love, passion, time and dedication from the Workbench Entertainment team can’t be measured in numbers.</strong></i><br><br>Wounded is a survival horror game that puts you in the role of Tim, a father who got separated from his daughter Lisa after a storm caught them off-guard out in the open sea. <br><br>Upon uncovering some of the secrets at the Big Rokk Motel, Tim realizes those who captured Lisa, are somehow related to the actions of his wife Andrea, a famous Altana Detective investigating “The Skinner” case.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1015130/extras/07565fd937bacaa8da0a26390a51c86f.webp?t=1754465655\" width=600 height=28 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1015130/extras/ced0558b28493282a87e5011a56912df.poster.avif?t=1754465655\" width=620 height=348 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1015130/extras/ced0558b28493282a87e5011a56912df.webm?t=1754465655\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1015130/extras/ced0558b28493282a87e5011a56912df.mp4?t=1754465655\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>The story in Wounded is rather simple, but it requires you as a player to connect some pieces of the puzzle on your own.

The main mechanic, which is hiding, is your best option in most of the situations. <br><br>For the optimal horror experience, we suggest that you play alone and in an environment that allows you to fully focus on your in-game decisions. Using a headset and playing in a dark room is recommended.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1015130/extras/b95a93213ff4c80ee9fbe68787b4a887.webp?t=1754465655\" width=600 height=28 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Simple yet intriguing story </li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Sounds that enhance the atmosphere</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Well crafted environment</li></ul>",
