But it doesn't stop there: after you complete a full round, the next 20 levels require bricks to be hit twice while their size get smaller or pulsate, for a total of 120 different experiences! Some bricks have power-up like extra ball, multi-ball, slow-time. ghost or gravity modifier. The game includes both a local and online Score board per difficulty to track your improvements.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is an excellent workout and it is fun to play!",
