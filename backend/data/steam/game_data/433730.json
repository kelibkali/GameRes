Vlad has a new mission for the gang, but things quickly get more... complicated once they arrive at the scene. With this update we introduce a brand new two-day heist that is unlike anything we've done before. Together with this comes a new shotgun, four melee weapons, four masks, four patterns, four materials and finally two new tracks from Simon Viklund.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/433730/extras/134dcbf5fca6d5759f011db0414e0351.avif?t=1756113752\" width=616 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>An All-New Two-Day Heist</strong> – Vlad has a very special mission for the PAYDAY gang that requires their specific set of skills - and patience.
