Barren and devoid of life, you must build a colony and explore the planet, uncovering the technology and secrets of an ancient civilization long gone.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1688350/extras/932b495bfb99229099330980a3f16a87.poster.avif?t=1720805242\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1688350/extras/932b495bfb99229099330980a3f16a87.webm?t=1720805242\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1688350/extras/932b495bfb99229099330980a3f16a87.mp4?t=1720805242\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Time is of the essence, however. The planet is ravaged by increasingly powerful and destructive storms that threaten to wipe out your entire colony. You only have a limited time before the storms will become too powerful to defend against. You must escape before it's too late. Can you find a means of defending yourself from the storms while you try to escape this barren world? Will you unlock the secrets of the wasteland planet and escape before it's too late?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1688350/extras/2c23b1ea75166109b6c448ca2c47b8cc.avif?t=1720805242\" width=616 height=80 /></span><br><br>Wastelander is a turn-based strategy game where every turn counts. To survive, you must plan and make the right decisions as you expand your colony and explore the planet in search of technological remnants of the ancient civilization that once inhabited the now barren wasteland.<br><br>Balancing exploration with expansion and defence is key to survival. You will need to ensure your colony has enough power to function but also keep pressing forward with your efforts to explore, while minimizing the damage the relentless storms cause. With each passing storm increasing in intensity and destruction, your basic defences can’t hold out forever.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1688350/extras/aacdf3eb021073b069ebd058c0109f60.poster.avif?t=1720805242\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1688350/extras/aacdf3eb021073b069ebd058c0109f60.webm?t=1720805242\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1688350/extras/aacdf3eb021073b069ebd058c0109f60.mp4?t=1720805242\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>You will need to prioritise what to focus on based on your current situation, deciding between searching for new technologies and a way off the planet or setting up defences for the impending storm. But sooner or later sacrifices will need to be made and you will need to choose what structures to save and what you let the storms destroy.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1688350/extras/243e28201179df4866dc1d2acaaaa45a.avif?t=1720805242\" width=616 height=80 /></span><br><br>Starting with nothing but the scattered remains of what was once your spaceship, you must begin to build your colony, expanding bit by bit. In the beginning, you will only have a limited amount of basic buildings available to you, to get your colony started.
