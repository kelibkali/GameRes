We hope this arcade style gameplay appeals to people looking for quick satisfying and especially <strong>challenging</strong> gameplay, making it a fun game to show off to friends.  <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/881310/extras/0dad920a8969fd48539463646c6ad7b4.poster.avif?t=1698756107\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/881310/extras/0dad920a8969fd48539463646c6ad7b4.webm?t=1698756107\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/881310/extras/0dad920a8969fd48539463646c6ad7b4.mp4?t=1698756107\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>For fans of story, immersion, and exploration, BearHammer features the beautiful island of Bearonia to explore with a variety of new weapons to unlock and special challenges hidden around the island.  You'll get the opportunity to ride a bear, fly on a dragon, use a mushroom drum set, and discover some of the hidden story elements behind the Toad King's invasion.   <br><br>You are tasked with defending Bearonia and its inhabitants of bears, turtles, and rabbits from the invasion of the evil armies of the Toad King, who summons evil StabRats, Crabbos, Dragon Beasts, Battle Toads, and more to spread his Power of the Frossst.  <br><br>This isn't another wave based game where you don't move and everything just comes at you--to win at BearHammer you must plan your attack and move throughout the level to stop different boss monsters and close portals from spawning more enemies.  <br><br>The game features teleport controls and free motion controls, which have given very few players dizziness due to the game's level design that features mostly flat ground and far views of the horizon.  <br><br>In the coming months, we plan to add online multiplayer to the game, to support both co-op modes and a 4-player domination mode where you'll have the ability to summon monsters to attack your opponents in addition to swinging the game's namesake BearHammers.  Further out on our road map, we'll also be adding additional maps and single player challenges.<br><br>For more information or any questions, feel free to come ask here on discord:<br>",
