    "description": "Face furious food fighting action in this room scale VR experience built exclusively for the HTC Vive.  Your Mom has stocked your new college place with fresh fruit and college essentials like ramen noodle soup.  Little did you know this time the food's eating you!  Protect yourself and save the world.  Eat, toss, stomp, kick and shoot your way to victory.  Mom will help you along the way to defeat the aliens who've animated food against us.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote: Vive Trackers are not required to play this game.  However, if you own them, you may strap them to your ankles and kick away.  If greeted by a &quot;Change Bindings For Alien Food Frenzy&quot; screen when trackers are powered on, dismiss it by selecting the Alien Food Frenzy icon at the bottom to go &quot;Back to App&quot;.",
