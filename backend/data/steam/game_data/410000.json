    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Really slow racing for 3 to 8 players</strong></h2>Chalo Chalo is a racing game that doesn't focus on speed, but on tactical choices and outsmarting your friends. You compete locally with three to eight players at the same time on the same screen. <br><br>A unique landscape is generated for each race. During the countdown you make a plan, taking into account the terrain, your opponents and the power pickups.<br><br>With a special power, or just a simple nudge, you can send an opponent off track, sometimes with fatal consequences. But when the others are closing in, be sure you can pull it off without harming your own position.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/410000/extras/6a8c0669a42d68c812926c294b0ba044.avif?t=1747930983\" width=600 height=240 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Local Multiplayer</strong></h2>Please be aware that <strong>Chalo Chalo has no single player, two player or online multiplayer modes</strong>. You need three to eight people with a controller each to play.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/410000/extras/5e810471c4ebc922c27bec972956049c.avif?t=1747930983\" width=600 height=160 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Note from the developer</strong></h2>Through the years we've shown Chalo Chalo at different festivals and conferences and it's especially in these settings that the game thrives. The recommended ingredients being: <br>- A large enough group of people. You can play the game with three people, but we've always felt the game starts to shine with 5 or more.<br>- A big screen. Bigger is better here.<br>- A bunch of controllers. We typically used a mix of both wired and wireless Xbox 360 controllers, but any controller recognized by Windows should work. Please note: We've gotten reports that if you're using Xbox One controllers the number of players will be capped at four.",
