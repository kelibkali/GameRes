Some mysteries, beyond man, have no logic, have no fate.<br><br>In the face of such, keep your wits close, but do not trust them. Trust not yourself, nor your senses. Your time, nor your wit.<br><br>For where time has stopped, but its flow has no end. For when passion calls, but hate runs deep.<br><br>Heed this warning, and do not wait. For laws of nature and laws of man. Have no logic, and have no weight.&quot;</i><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2099210/extras/e73cb5cb1298b143c7535437fc9dfcd1.avif?t=1712941198\" width=550 height=308 /></span><br><br>A global crisis that only continues to escalate.
