    "description": "BadRobots VR is an action shooter where your goal is to stop the boss from turning robots bad (they were not always bad you know). By fighting of robots in different environments and progress forward the &quot;factory&quot; you have the ability to slow down time a.k.a bullet-time. You'll encounter lumberjacks, hunters, police and other types of robots on your journey to the boss who controls all the robots (who are now bad).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game itself is straight forward, you shoot waves of robots and get scorepoints to progress in the game and unlock more levels. When the game is finished you can always go back and try to beat your old highscrore,  find all the hidden secrets (did I say that out loud?) or why not try the bonus never-ending-level where there will be no resting between waves.",
