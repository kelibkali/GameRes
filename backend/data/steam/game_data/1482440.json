    "description": "This demo is the Cube level from Zof.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will find puzzlement, exasperation and elation in the same proportions as in the actual game. So it's probably a good guide.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's quite a simple level, once you get what's going on. People are pretty much split down the middle on this. Half of them get it in 10 minutes, the other half spend a long time here. Which also good.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are two main hurdles. One is realizing what information is being given to you ( what's the little cube 'saying' ). The other, is realizing what assumption you have made, which is not true ( about teleporters ).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can use the guide in the community section if you get really stuck.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGood luck :)",
