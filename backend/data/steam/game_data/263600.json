Seeing that, I thought &quot;Well, I best make some content specifically for e-sports!&quot;<br><br>In the last 10 years I've scrapped the project twice. It wasn't until my third attempt that I created what is now known as EF-12.<br><br>Video games are, in comparison to other mediums, not held in very high regard by society. A player who took home a prestigious prize from a large e-sports event is unlikely to receive any sort of attention from society at large.<br><br>I think the fact many think of video games merely as time-wasters, or nothing more than a tool for companies to make money is a major reason for this.<br><br>Shogi, or Japanese chess, started out in much the same way - as nothing more than a simple game. However, its pioneers worked hard to promote it, and now players are respected in society.<br><br>I believe for video games to achieve a similar level of respect, there are two important things:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>    We must move away from the business-oriented concept of &quot;If it won't sell, we won't make it&quot;<br></li><li>    The game must be able to be quickly fine-tuned and balanced by users to maintain it's competitive element.</li></ul><br>EF-12 was developed with rule 1 as it's primary goal. I believe rule 2 has also been achieved.<br><br>I am very much looking forward to the day when users can join me in keeping both of these rules alive. Until then, I will keep working on EF-12 by myself.",
