It is full of issues and will not get updates as I do not have the files anymore. Please do not judge my other projects based on this one! I decided to make it free as I don't want to charge anything for it<br><br>Mouse Life - Parenthood is a simulation type game in which you play as a little mouse who has to raise his child. You will have to scavenge for cheese, stop ants from stealing it and stay away or hide from the cats that wish you gone.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >As the player, you need to watch for the time, hunger, fuel and other things that keep you alive and well, this is what makes the game a little bit more a Survival Simulation game and not just a Casual game. I hope you will enjoy playing!</p>",
