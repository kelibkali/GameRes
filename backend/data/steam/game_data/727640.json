    "description": "Incomprehensible interface errative puzzle game. No instructions!<br>This product includes 3 different puzzles.<br><br>Features:<br>- Native Windows Forms interface.<br>- The goal of each of these errative puzzle games is to set all the flags and then perform the final control activation, typically a scrollbar movement.<br>- All the flags are hinted in a message box which is shown by pressing a certain button in a previously unknown place.<br>- Every game has a way to close itself unexpectedly - this is a gameover and you have to restart it manually.<br>- Some controls reset your progress, but sometimes it is necessary to advance.<br>- In the end, the game also closes itself. There is only one way to finish each puzzle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >ШП-7: ГАМЕБОЕ ПЕРЕЛЬНИЦА</h2><br>Release: sometime around 2008<br>Re-release: 15.07.2011 22:33<br><br>Clicks to solve:<br>1 for the first window, 54 for the second, 14 for the third.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >ШП-8 и ШП-87</h2><br>Release: 26.07.2011 13:43<br><br>Clicks to solve:<br>ШП-8: 41<br>ШП-87: 9<br><br>ШП-87 is available when you launch ШП-8 with ШП-7 already launched.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >ШП-9</h2><br>Release: 28.07.2011 0:00 / 17.06.2011 21:31 (some kind of a time paradox)<br><br>Clicks to solve: ???",
