They were enrolled, trained, and taught in special academies. Hero School Story 2 places you in charge of a hero academy to create the next generation of heroes who will save Valthiria from the dark forces that threaten it. Take command of the faculty, nurture a unique and ever-changing roster of students, forge alliances with the kingdoms who vie for influence, and earn your place among the most prestigious Hero Schools in Valthiria.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1453640/extras/92bca2af462d4e8f84a59ebf248b9b92.avif?t=1726725091\" width=600 height=114 /></span><br><br>Combining the RPG and Simulation genres, in Hero School Story 2 you will manage your students by determining their learning schedules and courses, building their stats and skills to shape them into the heroes you desire. These stats are key when sending your students to fulfill quests from people all over Valthiria, defeating various enemies in strategic turn-based combat and adding to your academy’s renown. Yet there’s no time to rest on laurels – every school year the seniors will graduate and freshmen will enroll, so managing your academy to fit the dynamic roster of students is crucial.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Create Your Own Hero Academy</h2>As Principal of the academy, your task is to allocate your students what classes and courses to learn, shaping them into the heroes you want them to become. Will you focus on magical courses and become a school of great wizards, one for mighty warriors, or perhaps a bit of everything? Your management style will determine the kind of quests you can take. To complete harder quests, you need to build specific rosters to solve the challenges.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1453640/extras/a8bb62247ecdf81ac6c7ac64da38c40f.poster.avif?t=1726725091\" width=600 height=336 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1453640/extras/a8bb62247ecdf81ac6c7ac64da38c40f.webm?t=1726725091\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1453640/extras/a8bb62247ecdf81ac6c7ac64da38c40f.mp4?t=1726725091\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Plan, Forecast, Execute, Repeat </h2>Foresight and strategic turn-by-turn decisions are critical to succeed in our unique turn-based combat system.
