The game follows the deep intertwined stories of five people thrown together by their involvement in a fictional terror attack.<br><br>This sprawling story plays out through a combination of traditional interactive text, as well as explorable computer interfaces, conversations, IM's, phonecalls and more. CLOSED HANDS is a fragmented and complex narrative, playable in any order, that tells the story of the lead-up and aftermath of the attack: some stories go forward in time, some backwards, and some both.
