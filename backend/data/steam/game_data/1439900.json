You can find it here: <br><br>Star Matter is a single-player, 2D, tile based, spaceship physics RPG, where you pilot a ship that you are able to customize and configure to suit the current task, your playstyle, or what remains of the ship. Using your design and piloting ability, you will explore what remains of humanity after the collapse of Earth to an unknown alien threat. What path will humanity carve into the far future, if any?<br><br><strong>Ship Creation</strong><br>Your ship is the only thing standing between you and a neuro-clone into a new body, making it pretty important. As such, you are able to use the resources gathered from fair or foul means to improve existing ship designs or generate new ones, as you unlock additional ship components.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1439900/extras/21a2e8eab27b14549c9db19116412920.poster.avif?t=1626513235\" width=600 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1439900/extras/21a2e8eab27b14549c9db19116412920.webm?t=1626513235\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1439900/extras/c054cd07a2ffc4cc45679908f1fe8d7d.poster.avif?t=1626513235\" width=600 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1439900/extras/c054cd07a2ffc4cc45679908f1fe8d7d.webm?t=1626513235\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1439900/extras/5692a3ae8e2323740c853d149991c4ce.poster.avif?t=1626513235\" width=600 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1439900/extras/5692a3ae8e2323740c853d149991c4ce.webm?t=1626513235\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Dynamic AI</strong><br>The AI in Star Matter utilizes ships as well, and they are bound by the same restrictions as the player.

The player may be able to leverage these abilities to gain an advantage in a bad situation. These abilities currently include creating a gravity well and assuming control of an enemy ship. These abilities may be improved or expanded as the players' understanding of the alien threat grows.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1439900/extras/5c1e7f43d603b342b03c116173036c25.poster.avif?t=1626513235\" width=600 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1439900/extras/5c1e7f43d603b342b03c116173036c25.webm?t=1626513235\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Faction Interactions</strong><br>There are three primary factions making up what remains of humanity, and managing their expectations and interests may play a key role in the advancing of humanity.
