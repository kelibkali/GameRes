Roll up your sleeves, pop your collar and brew a pot of coffee, because today you're going to breach the networks of a mysterious and powerful corporation.<br><br><i>ROOT</i> is a cyber espionage themed hardcore stealth FPS that lets you play it how you want: whether creeping along corridors undetected or bursting into rooms to blow away all adversaries. Cyber terrorism is a dangerous profession, and risks have real consequences. Damage sustained cannot be recovered, the slightest mistake will jeopardize your chances to reach the next level.<br>  <br>During this undertaking of corporate crypto-espionage you will face many hostile programs, but your most dangerous enemy is the man who designed them. The Systems Administrator built the System from the ground up and holds immense power within the network. He will use the limitless resources at his disposal to prevent you from achieving your goal: total ROOT access to the System.<br> <br><strong><u>FEATURES</u></strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > <strong>/// Accurate Guns ///</strong></h2>        Your crosshair is literally a dot.
