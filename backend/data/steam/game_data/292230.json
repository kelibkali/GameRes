    "description": "Game Character Hub is the ultimate program for creating and editing 2D game assets. It provides a built-in generator for character and tileset creation. While the program was made to be compatible with RPG Maker XP, VX and VX Ace, the elements found in the program should work with other 2D game engines as well. RPG Maker assets are for RPG Maker use only.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/292230/extras/b102ac592448db10b1e8e290d93fa4b8.avif?t=1681233935\" width=610 height=148 /></span><br>With Game Character Hub, you can easily create characters by choosing generator parts provided in the program. Simply select a template, add items and you're done! You can also create your own custom templates and parts. Note that almost the same logic applies to tilesets, so it doesn't necessarily need to be characters!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/292230/extras/9826ec51cfc82684e8b8bffa9501666c.avif?t=1681233935\" width=610 height=148 /></span><br>With Game Character Hub's flexible layering, you can easily customize parts according to your needs; such as changing the opacity, renaming, merging and deleting parts to name a few. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/292230/extras/6ecf3b4023c48b6ef5ad0d0545a0fb67.avif?t=1681233935\" width=610 height=148 /></span><br>Game Character Hub's Preview window lets you see whats going on without having to stop what you're doing!
