    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > Mini-Dungeons Bundle #031-035</h2><strong> Mini-Dungeons are short, setting-agnostic adventures for 5th Edition which can be</strong><br><strong> easily inserted anywhere in your campaign. This bundle contains five such adventures.</strong><br><strong> Mini-Dungeon #031: Dwarven Dread</strong><br>Four to six characters of levels 5-6<br>Argyle the Betrayer was a powerful dwarven cave wizard that was corrupted by a derro magister named Angree, and is now quite insane and bent on the destruction of the surface races, most especially dwarves. Angree has subjugated Argyle using powerful hallucinogens, in addition to a number of duergar tyrants, and positioned Argyle as a mad savior to the duergar. Argyle and his &quot;servant&quot; Angree, as well as the duergar, spend most days torturing dwarves, or calling on elementals to forge alliances to overthrow the surface dwellers.<br><strong> Mini-Dungeon #032: Howling Halls</strong><br>Four characters of level 7<br>The characters may stumble upon this dungeon as part of a larger underground complex or they may be employed by a local power in order to clear this den of undeath.<br>This stone crypt is unlit and prolonged exposure to the numbing cold here will eventually lead to frostbite or hypothermia. What awaits in the dark, cold depths?<br><strong> Mini-Dungeon #033: The Legacy of Theft</strong><br>Three to five characters of levels 6-7<br>The town of Ghezbaldi has stood for millennia. Recent construction work to build a new inn uncovered the entranceway to a long abandoned underground complex. The builders of the inn, Edwyn and Jackson Cairn, took it upon themselves to drop down into the dark hallways of what some say is a long forgotten thieves' guild and explore. That was 3 days ago, and now the townsfolk are concerned.<br><strong> Mini-Dungeon #034: Mysteries of the Endless Maze</strong><br>Four to five characters of level 5<br>Adventurers make their way through a series of randomly shifting maze segments interconnected by magical portals. Passage between the segments of the dungeon are completely randomized as are the contents of each area within the maze. The adventurers must recover five keystones to access the maze vault and escape.<br>A powerful wizard created this maze to ensnare treasure hunters who may be bold enough to seek his prized hoard of magic items. Though the maze's creator died long ago, its magic persists and the enigmatic complex has yet to be solved. A wealth of treasure awaits any who are cunning enough to traverse the mysterious maze.<br><strong> Mini-Dungeon #035: The Queen's Estuary</strong><br>Four characters of level 5<br>The forest is alive with the song of birds and insects. The weather has warmed to a comfortable balmy temperature and the sweet smell of spring flowers drifts on the air. On such a marvelous, peaceful day, what could possibly go wrong?<br><i> Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by:</i><br><strong> Anthony Rush</strong><br><strong> Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included 5E Compatible ruleset. Compatible with Fantasy Grounds Unity<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
