Freyja looks to take revenge on Beladim. Her vengeance is aided by Vernia, a mysterious witch. Vernia taught Freya about the potential of the AeternoBlade. Freyja obtained the true power of the AeternoBlade with the advice of &quot;Bernard&quot;, the man who had been imprisoned in the Everlasting Void. With that, she can travel back in time before Beladim destroyed her village to save it and have her vengeance once and for all. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234120/extras/1312364d5ac622d85da615966d59b80f.poster.avif?t=1660792502\" width=636 height=358 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234120/extras/1312364d5ac622d85da615966d59b80f.webm?t=1660792502\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234120/extras/1312364d5ac622d85da615966d59b80f.mp4?t=1660792502\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><i>aeternoblade Of Past's Ability</i></h2><br>Time Travel: Everything except Freyja will be played back.
