    "description": "You have to control the animal in an uncompromising struggle for survival. Each has its own individual characteristics: mass, speed, manoeuvrability, damage, skin thickness, absorb and dry. The battle takes place on land, in water and in the air. Water is a major resource that activates regeneration and prevents death from thirst. You can distance yourself, but the drought begins and players are forced to go to a risky rapprochement in the fight for the last water.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >How not to became Food</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> You need water, just put your head in it.<br></li><li> Water goes out, it's inevitable.<br></li><li> Use claws, jaws, hooves, horns and beaks in the fight for last water.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Early Access Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The game is based on a sensitive sync of complex skeletons. Each part of the body, when collide with an obstacle, affects the movement according to its proximity to the center of gravity.<br></li><li> Sound appears through physical interactions. It feels authentic, and I think more surfaces will be added.<br></li><li> Animals not invented, only used. Fourteen species are available: bear, boar, crocodile, crow, deer, eagle, elephant, fox, goat, owl, hippopotamus, lion, rhinoceros, wolf. Their numbers are limited to common sense. This does not mean that new animals will be actively added, but in the future, it will probably be part of a season cycle.<br></li><li> I look at the simulation as a potential single player mode in which you could create battles, by controlling behaviors.<br></li><li> After obtaining sufficient data, detailed statistics for each species, player ratings, statistics, graphs, etc., will be available.</li></ul>",
