    "description": "Old Roots is a survival horror game, inspired in the siberian enviroment. When you are a hunter and you found something going wrong in the forest, what would you do?. Explore and find new things, or just practice shooting with your cans?<br />\r\nIn the forest, be careful where you step, there is so many bunkers from WW2 hide inside the earth, and some of them are haunted! Maybe the ancient viking gods where not a myth, and you must be stealthy or you will end death!",
