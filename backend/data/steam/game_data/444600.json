Thank you for your understanding.<br><br><i>​​A masked AI known as Program X has thrown cyberspace back into chaos. The unhacker, with next gen AI Neonya by his side, answers the call to battle. Our hero, however, is disturbed by one fact—Program X and her minions resemble old friends, friends who should have been long dead.​</i><br><br>* * *<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/444600/extras/42c7c8e3ecf96212997b25e0da5a3d70.avif?t=1661412503\" width=660 height=198 /></span><br><br><strong>A darker story:</strong><br><br><i>Unhack 1</i> was published in 2012, so I had plenty of time to mature since then. While Unhack 2’s characters are still a spirited bunch, this time, they will face a much darker journey.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/444600/extras/0bd6f1be7c0fb434de05b811bcf3620d.avif?t=1661412503\" width=660 height=198 /></span><br><br><strong>Humans VS AI:</strong><br><br>​AI will grow at a much faster rate than many of us can imagine. Will humanity become obsolete? Can AI hope to truly understand us?
