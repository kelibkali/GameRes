    "description": "What would you do if you found yourself in front of a mysterious portal that suddenly appeared in your back woods? Would you jump right in... or would you throw something into it first?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Silent Sky is a hand-drawn, not quite classical, point-and-click adventure game – an introduction to a longer journey that doesn’t end with the silent night sky.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story revolves around a twelve-year-old boy, who’s hungry for adventure. Unable to resist exploring, he soon stumbles upon something he wasn’t supposed to ever find. This discovery drags Siim to places he had no idea even existed. He’ll need to keep his childlike spirit intact in order to out think his opponents if he’s ever going to make it back home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen we gaze up at the night sky and view the stars, everything we see is calm and tranquil, but is it really so?",
