    "description": "This DLC for Aerofly FS 2 features over 30 of the best known and most beautiful airports of Switzerland, including Zürich, Grenchen, Samedan and Birrfeld. Furthermore this DLC features high resolution aerial images of Switzerland with a resolution of up to 1 meter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a special highlight, this DLC also includes the iconic airport Speck-Fehraltorf (ICAO-Code LSZK). This airport, in the Zürich Oberland, simply called 'Speck' by locals, is being operated by the Zürcher Oberland FGZO club/group. This airport, close to the Pfäffikersee, features a gras runway with Perfo plates and is very busy, especially in good weather during spring and summer time. We would like to thank the following people who helped us in getting this airport into the simulator: Fabi Riesen, Ines Widmer, Daniel Stäubli, Chirstoph Amman and Tino Seitz.",
