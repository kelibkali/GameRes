Check out Siralim Ultimate!<br><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/464620/extras/3bdfce015b84fd8e13dec675f2756fc5.avif?t=1682260276\" width=616 height=264 /></span><br><br>Siralim 2 is an old-school monster-catching RPG. Summon and customize hundreds of creatures to fight for you as you battle your way through endless dungeons. Find rare treasure and use it to upgrade your castle, empower your creatures, craft powerful artifacts, learn new spells, and much more. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/464620/extras/d1adf5b1bb6780c90806939d0719d2d7.webp?t=1682260276\" width=616 height=60 /></span><br><br>Every dungeon in Siralim 2 is randomly generated. This means that you'll never visit the same dungeon twice! Each dungeon also contains randomly generated quests and events, so there will always be fresh content for you to explore.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/464620/extras/35f0b69e1dcd396fefb3c47ce79ac704.webp?t=1682260276\" width=616 height=60 /></span><br><br>Capture and summon over 600 unique creatures to fight for you. Each creature has its own, unique traits which greatly affect their performance in battle. <br><br>Siralim 2 also features a breeding system! You can breed 2 creatures together and they'll lay an egg. The creature that hatches from the egg will inherit attributes from its parents. Breeding is the best way to unlock new creatures and to increase the strength of your party.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/464620/extras/2aea04105c3ee19947bda621ededb394.webp?t=1682260276\" width=616 height=60 /></span><br><br>Your creatures can equip powerful items called &quot;Spell Gems&quot;. Spell Gems allow their owners to cast the spell associated with the gem. Each gem also has randomly generated properties, changing the way they function. One Fireball gem might cost Health instead of Mana, while another Fireball gem might be cast automatically after its owner attacks an enemy.<br><br>There are over 300 different spells in the game, and each gem can have any 3 of 23 different properties. The possibilities are endless!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/464620/extras/9c299d5c5bcd01dac8816d90ad37c035.webp?t=1682260276\" width=616 height=60 /></span><br><br>Your creatures can equip artifacts which affect their stats, grant them new traits, and much more. With the help of the blacksmith and enchanter, you can forge, re-forge, brand, enchant, and disenchant your creatures' artifacts to suit their needs. Artifacts can have hundreds of possible properties, similar to how equipment works in games like <i>Diablo</i>. With over 800 different crafting materials to find, there are a lot of options available to you!<br><br>But items aren't the only things you'll be crafting in Siralim 2. You can also turn your favorite creature into a &quot;Nether Creature&quot;, allowing you to augment it with powerful items that no normal creature can use.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/464620/extras/6edab666705c0d9b17c4cc4bc4abfbdd.webp?t=1682260276\" width=616 height=60 /></span><br><br>Add new rooms, unlock new creatures, and entice citizens to live in your castle by purchasing upgrades for it. As the ruler of Siralim, it falls on you to decide when to improve your castle.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/464620/extras/639443797f822286198eb6e8fe3c61ec.webp?t=1682260276\" width=616 height=60 /></span><br><br>Siralim 2 is mean to be played forever. There is no level cap, nor are there any limits of any kind. The content becomes increasingly more difficult as you progress, so there's always a challenge waiting just around the corner no matter how long you play. The amount of content available to you is absolutely staggering - but don't worry; it's all introduced at a steady pace so as to not become too overwhelming. Some of our players have clocked in thousands of hours, and they still haven't seen all the game has to offer!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/464620/extras/d90ddd5aed67844957407a4384f0899d.webp?t=1682260276\" width=616 height=60 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Summon over 600 unique creatures to fight for you.
