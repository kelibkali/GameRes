    "description": "The soundtrack to Nectar of the Gods.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe catchy, boppy, synthy, groovy, buggy tunes in Nectar of the Gods were composed and performed by the talented duo of Tiffany Peng Hwa (TP Hwa) and Terry Peng. The tracks draw influence from the countertops they reside in, the bugs, the thirst, electronica, 80's dance, jazz, and more. We hope you enjoy!",
