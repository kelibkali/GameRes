Its operation seems to be complicated, but as you repeat playing, it will lead to the &quot;fun&quot; inherent in railroad games.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n●Always fun no matter how many times you play!! Process from start to game over.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince it is a good old-fashioned operation method, it takes a lot of time to run a train.<br />\r\n1. Click  at the title screen.<br />\r\n2. Click a stage in STAGE SELECT screen.<br />\r\n3. Click Normal train or Steam train in TRAIN SELECT screen.<br />\r\n4. The game screen is displayed.

The feeling of immersion increases every time you play.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n● Thrilling incidents occur one after another!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the train is running, you will be prompted to &quot;lose speed to 35km/h&quot; or &quot;stop by the signal!&quot; on the screen.<br />\r\nPress X key to turn the mas-con lever counterclockwise to decelerate, and hold the down-arrow button to apply brake. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n● We will not arrive at tomorrow just by running.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe event which is indispensable for railway game is &quot;to stop at stations&quot;.<br />\r\nA green line and a red line are drawn at the back of the platform. The green line corresponds with &quot;distance to go&quot;, and you have to stop the train at the point of zero distance to the line.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is the railway game that purely expresses the element of &quot;hard but can't stop&quot; that the current game industry has forgotten.",
