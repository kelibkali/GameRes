The game take's a lot of inspiration from the unreleased Atari 2600 title Aquaventure. As the titular &quot;Diver&quot; you traverse 5 different regions of the ocean seeking out sunken treasure (Booty) guarded by King Poseidon ,and his guardians.<br>These dives will not be a simple splash and grab though as you must manage a limited air supply while battling Poseidon's minions which include Starfish, Octopi, and etc. Do not threat though as the &quot;Diver&quot; has a few means to defend himself with his short range diver's knife ,and his trusty harpoon gun.<br><br>There are 5 different regions of the ocean where you take 5 dive's per a region with each being capped off by a battle with a guardian. Some dives may require a bit more work than just battling through the monsters of the deep as you may need solve various unique challenges. After each difficulty mode play-thru it offers an unlock which gives incentive to return to the ocean depths one more time on a higher difficulty setting.<br><br>The game offers full controller support with Xbox(360/One), and Dualshock 4 controllers which is the recommended way to play the game. Keyboard controls are also available although not recommended way to play. Each level has it's own chiptune soundtrack with the exception of the boss battles.<br><br><br>*****PLEASE NOTE*****<br><br>The reviews listed are from the Nintendo Wii U versions of the game pre-patch.
