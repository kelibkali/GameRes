    "description": "<strong><i>This game is heavily RNG, its dice based after all, do not buy if you can't handle RNG.</i></strong><br><br><i>TLDR; It's a Roguelike, get more dice, upgrade dice, get more items, upgrade items, get blessing, these you can't upgrade tho, kill monsters, 3 worlds.</i><br><br>In this exciting roguelike game, players must collect items, blessings, and dice to use as energy for powerful attacks on monsters as they journey through randomly generated worlds.<br><br>The battles are turn-based, with players able to choose their attacks on their turn and enemies attacking in sequence. Both players and enemies use dice as the cost for their abilities, and enemies may also have blessings that give them additional attacks or other benefits. If an enemy ability doesn't have sufficient dice to meet its requirements, it will miss. Enemy abilities will always use the highest valued dice available, unless it is beneficial to use a lower value dice for the attack.<br><br>Players have a variety of items to choose from, each with a limited number of uses indicated in the top right circle. These uses reset each turn unless the font is grayed and tilted. To use an item, players must select the dice they want to use as payment and then choose the item they want to use.<br><br>With over 100 items and 30 blessings to choose from, players have plenty of options for building the perfect character and strategy. As they progress through the game, they'll have the chance to collect new dice and upgrades to further enhance their abilities.<br><br>Players can choose their own path through the game world, using the map to decide which areas to explore next. Special map markers indicate areas where random events may occur, adding an element of surprise to the game. These events can provide helpful bonuses or unexpected challenges, and they offer an additional layer of depth to the gameplay.<br><br>But be prepared to face off against formidable bosses in each world, as only those who are able to defeat them will be able to move on to the next. Can you emerge victorious by defeating the final boss and claim your place as the ultimate champion?",
