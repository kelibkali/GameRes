    "description": "NOTES FROM THE SOLO DEVELOPER:<br>Please enjoy this virtual stressball for FREE while we keep going through this pandemic. This game is not meant to poke fun at the people suffering from the COVID-19 virus; it's meant to put a ''face'' on this virus and explode the shit out of it because that's exactly what it deserves. This project was inspired by one of the many stupid situations that resulted in the initial lockdown back in March. Most notably, the toilet paper hoarding (which already feels like ages ago). It's dumb, it's over the top and it's FUN. I may or may not keep adding new game mechanics as I'll eventually go back to set for film work.<br><br>There's also an ANDROID versus of the game that's very similar to the PC version and is also FREE. It's called OPERATION VIRUS.<br><br>My offer to send $10 to the first person that can reach 10 000XP still stands. Print screen proof and email at dan @ supernice.ca <br><br>--<br><br>Ever wanted to throw ridiculous amounts of toilet paper at giant viruses invading your home? Well here's your chance.<br><br>Operation COVID-19 is an endless first person shooter in which you can give those viruses what they deserve: blow them all up!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1316570/extras/a6d8cf85ea2b5d6e4bc198ec0a3205ee.poster.avif?t=1598888569\" width=520 height=292 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1316570/extras/a6d8cf85ea2b5d6e4bc198ec0a3205ee.webm?t=1598888569\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1316570/extras/a6d8cf85ea2b5d6e4bc198ec0a3205ee.mp4?t=1598888569\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><strong>FAST PACED</strong><br>We made the game and even we can't keep up.

For a second, the generated force field will push away any viruses trying to infect you and give you a short moment to catch your breath.

There's more? Of course! When there are too many of them, activate the Power Jump function and the TP-1000 Gun™ will reverse gravity for you.

LOOK COOL AF.</strong><br>The gif is pretty self-explanatory.<br><br>Happy hunting.<br><br><strong>FROM THE DEVELOPER</strong><br>Hey! Thanks for checking out my first game. I made this alone while in quarantine by teaching myself game logic in Unreal Engine 4 with YouTube tutorials. It started out as a simple gag to make my kids laugh and it devolved (evolved?) into what you see now in all it's 1980s fueled glory. I really hope you'll enjoy what I put together and for 1$ I think you'll have your money's worth out of it. Next step will be to implement the Steam Achievements in a future update and hopefully many more features!<br><br>You rock.<br><br>-Dan Gaud<br><br><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br><br>WASD + MOUSE to move around<br><br>E to open doors<br><br>CTRL to crouch<br><br>SPACEBAR to jump, double jump or triple jump.<br><br>MOUSE LEFT CLICK to fire main weapon<br><br>MOUSE RIGHT CLICK  to fire secondary push force function",
