Roguebreaker is my love letter to that time of my life, when you could just lose yourself in a colorful world for a little bit. Beat a level, unlock a new upgrade, and repeat. <strong>It's a small, simple game designed to be played in a short sitting, just long enough to zone out and have a good time for a few minutes and relax</strong>.  I hope you're able to feel a little bit of that as you play. If not, I'd be happy to hear why and what I could do to make it that much better for you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Thanks so much for giving it a shot!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/731420/extras/40ec2898243ed6a690d68c1bebbdb931.poster.avif?t=1752071784\" ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/731420/extras/40ec2898243ed6a690d68c1bebbdb931.webm?t=1752071784\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Break enough bricks and you make a choice between two upgrades.
