    "description": "A fun and charming RPG with lots of cute characters and monsters. Join LADY and friends on their quest to discover the origins of their magical powers, enjoy fast-paced turn based combat as you fight your way through the realm in pursuit of a destructive force, learn new spells along the way, and most of all enjoy the companionship of your party. The game is approximately 5 hours in length. It is loosely based on the game Fateholders of Tetsoidea, but re-imagined in 3D.",
