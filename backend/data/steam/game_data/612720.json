That's a long time. What's the deal with that then? </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Well SAELIG is a hobby project I work on after work and on weekends, and there is no set ending or final design. SAELIG continues to evolve over time and is updated fairly often with fixes, tweaks, and new features. So while SAELIG is in Early Access, it's less because it's missing lots of content, and more because I see it as a living project. It's always evolving and changing, and I feel like the Early Access tag is a convenient way to indicate just how much aspects of the game can change between updates. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>The Game:</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>SAELIG</strong> is a strategy game that blends simulation, RPG elements, trading, and business management, where your goal is to ensure the survival, wealth, and legacy of your family. Set in the Dark Ages of England, you’ll step into the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex during a time of turmoil. Engage in commerce, manage your enterprises, and make crucial decisions to carve your own path and leave a lasting mark on the world for generations to come.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You have the freedom to shape your destiny and play your way—become a trader, a business owner, a hardworking labourer, a landlord, a cunning criminal, a vigilant watchman, an influential abbot, a skilled hunter, or explore other roles. The choice is yours.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>SAELIG</strong> features a dynamic, living world where every action counts, and each character leads a life of their own. You’re not here to save the world or play the hero—you’re here to live your life, make your choices, and do your best to thrive in a world full of possibilities.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p
