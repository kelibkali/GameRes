    "description": "Your goal is to climb the 1000 meter mountain to save your wife, Mrs. Chicken who's been captured by the kangaroos. Bounce from platform to platform, collecting your eggs that have been stolen, and avoid obstacles along your journey like the Black Goo, poisoned eggs, kangaroo guards who are on patrol at different elevations, and one big windmill. The more eggs you collect in the shortest amount of time increases your total score. Different eggs and other collectibles offer different power ups. Some of these are... the Easter Egg which gives you super jump abilities, the Space Egg which lets you experience zero gravity as you collect all nearby eggs and fly past all obstacles, the Juice Box which grants temporary invincibility. Challenges within the game unlock different collectibles that each have unique powers.",
