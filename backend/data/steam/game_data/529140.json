    "description": "Have you ever wondered what the <strong>Gods</strong> would play if they had a sport? Well, the Aztec and Mayan civilizations played a brutal ball game representing their deities’ eternal struggle for supremacy. In <strong>Ulama: Arena of The Gods</strong>, you get to experience what the game would be like if the <strong>Gods themselves</strong> played it! <br><br><strong>Ulama: Arena of the Gods</strong> is a mix between a <strong>2D brawler</strong> and a <strong>team ball sport</strong>. In it, players form into teams and pick their characters from a <strong>roster of the Aztec pantheon</strong>. Then they duke it out in the ball court to <strong>score the most goals</strong> on the opposing team’s portal, hopefully <strong>beating their rivals senseless in the process!</strong> Each character has unique characteristics and abilities that the player will be able to combine with their teammates’ to do awesome plays or knock their opponents right off the stage. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>4 player intense couch multiplayer <br></li><li>4 Aztec deities to choose from (for now!) <br></li><li>2 bloodthirsty arenas (for now!) to duke it out with your friends <br></li><li>Perfect blend of visceral combat action and sport strategy <br></li><li>Stylized and vibrant visuals and soundtrack based on ancient American mythology <br></li><li>Option to sacrifice your loser friends to the ancient gods (this activity not rated by the ESRB)</li></ul>",
