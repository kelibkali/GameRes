    "description": "Take a journey through the mind of musician Reuben Wu who scored an original soundtrack to this experience. Travel through his imagination to amygdala while listening to his original scored soundtrack. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nReuben's real life brain data was scanned with an MRI to allow you a portal into the human brain, allowing viewers to enter, view, and explore the mind in a brand new way. Debuting the world's first-ever animated VR neuro experience powered by AMD's pioneering virtual reality technology LiquidVR™, GE is bringing viewers into the imagination and brain of accomplished photographer and DJ Reuben Wu, for a journey through Reuben’s neurological responses to his thoughts, ideas, fears and memories. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreated by Kite &amp; Lightning in partnership with GE &amp; AMD , “Neuro” gives a peek into how scientists are breaking new ground to understand how the brain works through advanced imaging technology.",
