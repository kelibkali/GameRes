    "description": "The year is 2011, and Mirror Image Software are working on the long awaiting threequel ATLAS: THE FINAL, the big flagship game for the next console generation. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's not going well. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMonica is a polite, well assuming and ambitious woman in the male dominated environment of Mirror Image. After failing her promotion interview, she returns to an empty QA office, watches her computer malfunction, and gets sucked into the game itself. Through narrative choices, workmate IM conversations and platforming, she must navigate the game world. As her two worlds start to intertwine, choices made in the game may leak out in the real world and vice versa.",
