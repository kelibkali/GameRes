    "description": "From roaring down the streets of Neon City's busiest highway to upgrading your Red Stallion in Harry's underground garage, the original soundtrack of Dirty Harry's Thunder Drive paints a dangerously upbeat world with 80s Retro Synthpop flowing through its veins.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOriginally composed during the 48-hour Global Game Jam 2020 exclusively for Dirty Harry's Thunder Drive, the downloadable version of the soundtrack offers expanded and deeper tracks, re-produced for deeper engagement and easy listening.",
