    "description": "The Incredible Andventures of Van Helsing III Original Sountrack<br />\r\nMusic by Gergely Buttinger<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVan Helsing, monster hunter will face the most difficult trials of his life as he is trying to destroy his nemesis. The civil war is over in Borgovia, but the future still looks grim. The city of weird science is in ruins and a strange cult prophesises the coming of the end times. And they might be just right: a wave of uncanny events shakes the land, and it's all connected to a former ally turned into fearful archvillain. Which means that Van Helsing will do what he does best: he grabs his weapons, prepares his deadly tricks and hunts down the most dangerous monsters who has ever lived... and this time it's personal.",
