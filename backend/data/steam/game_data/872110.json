    "description": "<strong>Burden of Proof is a hybrid genre game that combines elements from third person exploration games with a Visual Novel presentation. Inspired by works such as Ace Attorney and Danganronpa, Burden of Proof offers a fresh take on the courtroom drama by allowing you to explore the crime scene in 3D. Understanding the layout and details of the crime scene will determine whether you can complete your case in the courtroom, and whether you will succeed in this new adventure!</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/872110/extras/4c165c91399fa938b23f4380208bde09.avif?t=1758217045\" width=600 height=74 /></span><br><br>Crimes have been running rampant in this city, and the cases are piling up. As the legendary attorney Conrad Cross, you'll be tasked with exploring the crime scenes and tracking down leads as you uncover the mystery behind a series of murders that are somehow connected. Ominous organizations, spies, and rebel groups are all after a seemingly harmless piece of computer hardware that holds a deadly secret. As the situation develops, you'll have to use your skills in logic and reasoning to outwit the criminals who want to escape your grasp of justice. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/872110/extras/56f217fcfa4d43a98cda9e17c07e50a8.avif?t=1758217045\" width=600 height=74 /></span><br><br>The burden is on <i>you</i> to present what you've learned in the courtroom, and to counter your opponent's statements with smart remarks. The Judge has acquired Counselors who have a say in the verdict, each with their own personalities. To succeed, you must not only convince the Judge, but these new Counselors as well! Cross-examinations are vital to drawing the truth out from witnesses, and your evidence is key to developing the court's understanding of the crimes you face. However, the culprit won't always go quietly. In moments of panic, you must shoot down faulty reasoning with contradictory evidence in order to bring the Counselors and the Judge to your side. You have the power to choose whether or not to object when a controversial statement is made in the courtroom, and your choice could either help or harm your case. Choose wisely, and demonstrate your understanding to the court in order to get the verdict in your favor! <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/872110/extras/631682eab57c2387d0004e9c26ac5a60.avif?t=1758217045\" width=600 height=74 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Complete challenging puzzles in the courtroom that test your deduction skills<br></li><li>Play as both a prosecutor &amp; a defense attorney<br></li><li>Choose when to &quot;object&quot; and when to remain silent<br></li><li>Face a variety of opponents with unique strategies and personalities<br></li><li>Explore the crime scene in full 3D<br></li><li>Branching paths that allow you tackle the case how <i>you</i> want<br></li><li>Duel your opponent in a series of rapid-fire questions regarding the case<br></li><li>Demonstrate key mechanics of the crime to the court<br></li><li>Full Visual Novel experience with over 15 hours of story<br></li><li>Cross-examine important witnesses &amp; discover the true culprit<br></li><li>4k screen support &amp; runs at any framerate<br></li><li>Native versions for Mac OSX, Windows, and Linux<br></li><li>Support for the XBox One and Playstation 4 Controllers<br></li><li>An original soundtrack &amp; album release</li></ul>",
