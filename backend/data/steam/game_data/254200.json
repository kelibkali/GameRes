This has included radical visual alterations, completely reworking the surface, along with a brand-new rendering system. On top of that, there has been an enormous amount of work to make the game more understandable and accessible for new players, with a new UI, new Tutorial, new Missions and a updated context-sensitive Handbook. The combination of these things should work towards making it feel like a fresh, new experience.  Prepare for a new exploration and survival experience! </strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong><strong></strong></strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i><strong><strong><strong>FortressCraft Evolved</strong></strong></strong></i><strong><strong> is a unique blend of Voxel Landscapes, Tower Defense, Crafting, Logistics, Exploration, Combat and Assembly lines. Players begin by crash-landing on a strange alien world, left with only a small handful of starting machines. Using hand-held scanners they must locate ore resources, place down Ore Extractors and Conveyors to automate the raw material back to the Smelter; take the fresh ingots through multi-machine assembly lines, followed by researching new technologies that help them explore thousands of meters below the planet's surface. </strong></strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong><strong></strong></strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong><strong>An advanced HoloBase allows players to keep an eye on their factory which they must defend against waves of alien attacks with multiple tiers of missile and energy turrets.
