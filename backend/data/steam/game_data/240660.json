    "description": "Told as a “Wuxia” story, which literally means &quot;martial hero&quot;, Mirage captures the essence of a broad genre of Chinese fiction concerning the adventures of martial artists.  <br><br>Shrouded in secrecy, an organization of assassins wreak havoc on the local populace.  Two assassins Soul and Shang, find a window of opportunity to strike while all their enemies can be found in one place.  Their mission is simple: take down all their enemies or die in the attempt.  They will face many challenges and discover lost secrets as they embark on a perilous journey against terrible odds.  <br><br>Take control of Soul and Shang and wield two separate martial arts styles to defeat their foes. <br><br>Soul is an orphan born with the temperament of a master. His skills are self-taught and so lack refinement, but his potential is undeniable. He favors Dark Wound, a short bladed weapon given to him by his adoptive father, rumored to be one of the Night Masters..<br><br>Shang Zuo is a calm, unflappable fighter of average skill, but who possesses a centered view of all things powerful enough to influence physical objects. This “Sword Temper” skill allows him to destroy objects without moving a muscle and to knock arrows out of the sky with but a single thought. Together they will face the unknown and harness new skills as they face down a terrible conspiracy.<br><br><strong>Mirage Features</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>2 against the world– Tag team in and out as either protagonist at any time.<br></li><li>or play together for local multiplayer experience<br></li><li>Gear up – Discover new weapons, abilities, and unique items to bloody your foes. <br></li><li>8 distinct levels – Fight your way through an army of minions and face a true challenge by encountering a unique Boss at every Stage.<br></li><li>Learn the truth – Secrets abound and the full story of Mirage may be discovered by a collection of books, letters, and drawings strewn about the martial world.
