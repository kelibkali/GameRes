    "description": "Robot Incursion is a virtual reality wave shooter for SteamVR. You can't get away with just standing still and you will need to physically move around, taking cover and dodging bullets. You will need a play space of at least 2 x 1.5 metres. There is 1 training level and 5 combat levels, where you will have to defend yourself with either an assault rifle, turret or grenades.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach level has a leaderboard, so you can compete with other players to get the highest score.",
