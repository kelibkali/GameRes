However, that has not come without dissensions among the Sophorians, and sometimes very violent conflicts. In the recent past two huge attacks had occurred that threatened the whole civilization. The first one struck the government. The second one struck the Sophorian army. But was there a connection between those attacks, and will history repeat itself over and over until there’s no civilization left?<br><br>It has now been a year since a devastating EMP wave left one of the largest cities broken and disconnected. A lot of labour and resources went into restoring the city over the course of the year, but it appears things are not about to settle down yet.<br><br>Adrial and his team of allies have been caught in another attack - but who is attacking this time and what are their motives? It is now up to you to assemble your allies, uncover this scheme, expose the enemy, and stop them before their actions magnify into catastrophic proportions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Get three games for the price of one! Incitement 1 &amp; 2 are, and always will be, freeware!</h2><br>If you want to support this game and all my other past and future games further, please check out my patreon page below!<br>",
