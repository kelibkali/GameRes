Apparently, the letter had never been delivered, or so they say...<br />\r\nAccording to the letter, you're father left you a &quot;very special&quot; heirloom back at his old estate. You haven't been there in so long...<br />\r\nYou enter inside the mansion to search the artefact but a ghost is trying to stop you from getting it.<br />\r\nThis game is a short experience (5-10min) first person shooter with a short story.<br />\r\nThe theme of the game is horror action in a victorien mansion. <br />\r\nAttention!!! This game has only one level.<br />\r\nThis game is a school project created in 3 months by a team of 4 students.<br />\r\nPlease understand that, as a result, this game has a very limited scope.<br />\r\nWith time, the game may receive updates if it is received positively.<br />\r\nThis game will also be used as a tool for us to get better, so there may be new levels added by certain members of the team to show their progress.<br />\r\nWe are all looking to work in the video game industry, so we very much welcome any and all constructive criticism!",
