    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >History</h2>SodaCity is a fictional metropolis where inhabitants are soda cans, dominated by the organized crime, violence and warfare.<br><br>You play as Mr. Redd, who’s on a personal vendetta against SodaCity’s organized crime. Mr. Redd is a retired bounty hunter who seeks to avenge his brother’s death, carrying a one-can assault on every single criminal territory until he destroys every one of the city’s bosses.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><strong>Experience a modern take on old school game genres:</strong><br>SodaCity is heavily based on classic beat ‘em ups from the SNES era but the main gameplay mechanic is shooting, so we ended with a shoot ‘em up with the weird, tilted, 2.5D perspective of classic beat ‘em ups.<br><br><strong>Try out 38 upgradeable weapons:</strong><br>Weapons differentiate themselves by their different stats, which are: Damage, Range, Ammo per clip, reload speed, Rate of Fire. We focused on making every weapon type relevant for different situations.<br><br><strong>Fight your way across 18 levels in 6 different zones:</strong><br>As you progress through the game, you will dismantle parts of the main crime organization. The difficulty progresses as more “intelligent” and “emotionally” stable enemies appear with more powerful weapons.<br><br><strong>Overcome 7 boss battles:</strong><br>Each boss is the leader of an specific crime group. In order to clear a zone you need to beat the corresponding boss.<br>Boss fights operate as separate levels. Each boss have unique attacks that offer a different type of challenge.<br><br><strong>Bullet Time!</strong><br>Each kill has a small probability of activating the bullet time effect, in which time slows down but the player gets to move faster than the enemies, offering an advantage for a limited time. It’s possible to add time by increasing the combo meter.<br><br><strong>Full controller support:</strong><br>Because the amount of challenge and the comfort that a controller provides, we recommend to play SodaCity with controller.<br>On PC the game was developed and tested using a wired Xbox360 gamepad controller.<br>On Mac the game was developed and tested using a PS3 gamepad controller.",
