    "description": "The Pirates of Drinax<br>A truly massive Traveller sandbox, the Pirates of Drinax is packed with enough adventures and source material to keep even the most dedicated group going for years!<br>In the Pirates of Drinax, the Travellers play a band of adventurers entrusted by the King of Drinax with a letter of marque, permitting them to prey on 'illegal' trade within the borders of the vanished kingdom. The King hopes this piracy will give him the leverage he needs to restore Drinax to its former glory, and intends for the Travellers to win back all the planets lost over the last two centuries - but the King's plans are just the starting point for this campaign.<br>Once the Travellers have their letter of marque and ship, it's up to them what to do next. Will they stay loyal to their patron and help restore Drinax? Will they turn rogue and create their own kingdom? Will they be heroes or monsters, pirates or privateers? Will they make their fortune amid the pitiless stars, or will the cold depths of the Trojan Reach be their grave?<br>The Pirates of Drinax is adapted from three hardbacks and a poster:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Book 1: The Pirates of Drinax Campaign<br></li><li>Book 2: The Trojan Reach<br></li><li>Book 3: Ships of the Reach<br></li><li>A giant 28&quot; x 40&quot; double-sided poster map</li></ul>   The three hardback books that form The Pirates of Drinax contain a full campaign, the Trojan Reach sector, rules and source material introducing the ferocious but noble Aslan, and many new ships unique to the Reach, along with a giant poster map featuring the Trojan Reach sector, the Floating Palace of Drinax, and the Harrier-class commerce raider.<br>The Pirates of Drinax truly has everything you need to run an action-packed Traveller campaign.<br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Traveller 2E (Mongoose) ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
