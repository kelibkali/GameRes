    "description": "You start off in front of a black door with multiple locks. Where are you? You look around and see a typical living room with not so typical furniture. That's when you see a timer at the top of your screen. You remember reading the description for this game, and you saw that it said &quot;Escape or Die&quot;. So, you start figuring out how to escape. In the end, there are 3 ways to escape, each one involving the collection of multiple parts that can work together and help you finally escape this isolated mansion. Controls: WASD or Arrows, SPACEBAR for Jump, F to Collect Parts.",
