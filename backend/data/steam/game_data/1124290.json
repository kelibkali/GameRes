    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Virtual pong-styled sport game</h2>In Neon Pong you will have to prove your skills and reflex. <br>You need to maintain bouncing balls towards the blocks at the end of the room, with paddles. <br>Even tho it might seem easy - it's clearlly not!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Prove yourself in three different game modes</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Basic Pong</strong> - The most basic way to play Neon Pong. Balls appear only in one color, you've got two paddles. After each 30 seconds next wall of blocks will appear, so you must be quick!<br></li><li><strong>Colorful Blitz</strong> - A challenging mode where the blocks, balls and paddles needs to match a color. After hitting box the ball changes color. To bounce it you need to change the color of paddle to match it. You will have to be switching between them all the time! <br></li><li><strong>Shield Bolt</strong> - Get the elastic shield attached to your both paddles. In this mode you will have to be more wary how your paddle looks like and where in space is it placed.</li></ul>",
