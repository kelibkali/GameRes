    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > In 2019 nearly 200 million passengers used public transport, traveling nearly 30 million km. As part of an analysis, the company has determined that every third passenger traveled without a valid ticket. The company estimated that it’s losing them millions each year. As part of the repair plan, you have been hired as a ticket controller to catch and punish everyone who doesn't follow regulations. Fines, reprimands, arguments and even some violence — you will have to work with that on a daily basis. In addition, you will also take care of the visual aspect of our fleet, replacing missing elements, repairing the broken ones and keeping the bus nice and clean. The company counts on you! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Good Morning, Tickets Or Passes Please</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >When being on duty inspect all passengers for validate tickets. Make sure that high statistics of people driving without will quickly drop to zero.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >No Ticket, No Ride</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Stick to the rules, no ticket, no ride.
