A game that feels at once familiar, yet novel.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1070150/extras/a70d83bd0aae4aae95524b320bccb882.poster.avif?t=1761585062\" width=600 height=250 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1070150/extras/a70d83bd0aae4aae95524b320bccb882.webm?t=1761585062\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1070150/extras/a70d83bd0aae4aae95524b320bccb882.mp4?t=1761585062\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1070150/extras/b43b03ccb0861f4904c0c1bbbad2f445.webp?t=1761585062\" width=18 height=18 /></span> EARLY ACCESS FEATURES:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Three playable characters: Slugger, Artist, &amp; Spy (with more hot on their heels)</strong> - Whether you enjoy rushdown or a more methodical style of play, each character is designed to give players the tools to approach fights any way you like. May creativity be your only limiter!<br></li><li><strong>Online play with rollback netcode</strong> - No longer do you need a perfect internet connection to have a smooth online experience!<br></li><li><strong>Fight against our AI</strong> - Don't feel like hopping online? Test your mettle versus our computer players.<br></li><li><strong>Unique stages &amp; game modes</strong> - Ever wonder what <strong>battle royale</strong> would look like in a platform fighter? Grab 15 friends and try it out for yourself in our battle royale map. Or give our arena stages a try. It's a cage match!<br></li><li><strong>Unique gameplay mechanics</strong> - We focused on creating gameplay mechanics that either open up new tools for players to explore (<i>Focus Attacks</i>, <i>Airdash Cancels</i>) or solve longstanding issues in platform fighters (<i>Combo Gravity</i>). <br></li><li><strong>Controller &amp; keyboard support</strong> - Currently you can play on Xbox, PlayStation, and GameCube controllers. You can also reconfigure and save your controls if you don't like our defaults. If you prefer tap jump on, that's your call. No hard feelings.<br></li><li><strong>Low computer requirements</strong> - Runs on toasters! Well, not <i>literal</i> toasters...</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1070150/extras/fcefda29c60542be468b93c84c6bdf22.poster.avif?t=1761585062\" width=600 height=268 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1070150/extras/fcefda29c60542be468b93c84c6bdf22.webm?t=1761585062\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1070150/extras/fcefda29c60542be468b93c84c6bdf22.mp4?t=1761585062\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1070150/extras/b43b03ccb0861f4904c0c1bbbad2f445.webp?t=1761585062\" width=18 height=18 /></span> <strong>PLANNED FEATURES:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Story mode</strong> - Does a local/online coop metroidvania mode sound as good to you as it does to us? Sure hope so, because this is at the top of our list for a reason!<br></li><li><strong>More characters!</strong> - Other than the six we've already revealed, we've already got concept art for 10 more characters and ideas for many more! Basically, we want to pump out content for this game as long as we're able to!<br></li><li><strong>Items</strong> - We've got a long list of items we want to put into the game, sourced both internally and from community members. We have one implemented already, which lets you have !!

Everybody wins when they're set up well.<br></li><li><strong>Minigames</strong> - There are so many offshoot game modes we want to try, both big and small. For some this is a nice distraction, for others I bet this becomes the main thing they like about the game.<br></li><li><strong>Mod support</strong> - We're big fans of games with strong mod support, so obviously we want to set up mod support for our game as well.<br></li><li><strong>Custom stages</strong> - We'd also love to make a system for rating them in-game and rewarding players who make fantastic stages.<br></li><li><strong>Cool cosmetics</strong> - Always fun to see characters reimagined, and also fun to be able to express yourself in-game.<br></li><li><strong>...and much more!</strong></li></ul>As you can see, there are a ton of features we want to add.
