He is recruiting you to wield this device and save humanity.  What do you say?  Do you want to save humanity?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/528420/extras/d6bba50d0bee381f7d32602dd77ed231.avif?t=1668546821\" width=610 height=227 /></span><br><br><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br><br>Use your mouse to control the EEODD 2000 and fire balls of AntiOrbium at the Evil Orbs.  Because AntiOrbium is a very rare element, there is only so much to go around.   Fortunately, you can also use the EEODD to control the balls after you have fired them at the orbs and try to knock the balls back at remaining Orbs to maximize the amount of Orbs popped per each AntiOrbium ball fired.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/528420/extras/040c773387647236c233742d586f1141.avif?t=1668546821\" width=610 height=162 /></span><br><br><strong>GAME</strong><br><br>The Evil Orbs are devious and have utilized common materials from Earth to protect themselves from your barrage of AntiOrbium.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/528420/extras/9f19a44ce51a9e4b0214fcc2818a2205.avif?t=1668546821\" width=610 height=135 /></span><br><br><br>As in any armed conflict between humans and mysterious Orb-like entities, Dr. Hammersphere is hard at work inventing special powerups for your EEODD 2000 to win the arms race with the Evil Orbs.
