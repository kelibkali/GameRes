After the fire in his home village, he really lost his mind. Fireworks and rockets became his main entertainment. Bob always wants more of them and he is certainly not aware of any safety rules. His “toys” constantly explode at the most inopportune moment or with the most inappropriate force. Surprisingly, he always remains unharmed and does not even imagine how an encounter with a blast wave can harm someone. That is why even his own brothers are afraid of Bob.<br><br>The unique armored cars presented in packs are known for their perfect balance of weapons, armour and speed in combat. To put the car in the garage, go to the “Packs” tab, select the desired armoured car and click the “Assemble” button.<br><br>When you purchase this pack, the number of parts that can be used to build a vehicle increases up to 60.<br><br>Buying the pack also gives early access to several faction-specific structural parts. These parts become available immediately upon purchase and are not issued again upon reaching the appropriate reputation level. Some parts are unique and can only exist in a single copy.<br><br>Unique portraits provide an excellent opportunity to stand out among the survivors.<br><br>Paint cans are a way to make your armored car different from the pack.<br><br>Coins — is the in-game currency, which is used on the market to purchase armoured car parts from other survivors and to pay for the rent of part-building workbenches. Attention! When buying multiple packs, the acquired coins stack!",
