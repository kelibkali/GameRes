How far would you go to save him?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSaving Mr. Sparkles is a tough platformer where you have to use your momentum to beat short but challenging levels. Your goal is to chase after your cat Mr. Sparkles, save him, and bring him back home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game has simple controls. Simply run, jump, and (in later levels) dash. Though using a controller is still advised.",
