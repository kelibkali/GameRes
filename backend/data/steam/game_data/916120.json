    "description": "Welcome to the wonderful world of Rascals, the VR board game where you take first person control of your pieces to play dirty tricks on the opposition. It plays much like any other board game where you throw dice to move your pieces along a path from Start to Goal, until you sneak up behind one of your friends and shoot him in the back of the head. If that doesn't sound like fun, you can always crush him with a rolling boulder, or just blow him right off the board. If just racing all your pieces to Goal isn't enough, you can try your hand at quicker game modes like racing a single piece to goal, Hold the Fort in which you must control the Goal area to score points, or Last Man Standing where you simply have to survive.<br><br>You will be doing battle against a varied bunch of AI personalities, with different skill sets and tactical preferences setting their play styles apart. To help you gain an edge you have access to a wide array of weaponry, ranging from rocks and guns, through explosive bananas and dynamite, to Ninja Whale attacks and insidious arrows that keep hurting your victim until he can afford to remove it. The Rascals themselves are both cute and creepy, the perfect victims of your acts of violence, lovingly crafted from exotic wood in a world of marble and granite.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Single player career mode with 60 missions<br></li><li>8 distinct AI personalities<br></li><li>15 weapons and powerups<br></li><li>20 levels<br></li><li>Hot seat multiplayer support<br></li><li>R/C toys and other distractions for when someone else is taking his turn</li></ul>",
