    "description": "Digital Diamond Baseball is a flexible, transparent, and hyper-accurate computerized baseball simulator that allows gamers to play games, series, tournaments, and entire seasons, using players from any baseball season in history.  Included with the game are several 'all-time team' libraries as well as <strong>complete seasons from 1931-2020</strong>.  These seasons include as-played lineups, real-life schedules and transactions, left/right splits (1954-2020), custom player ratings (1954-2020), and ballparks (with park factors, and over 40 ballpark images).  In addition, you can utilize the easy to use player library tools to customize your libraries by adding player pictures, logos, sounds, and custom play-by-play calls.  You can also quickly and easily build your own custom seasons from scratch using team/players from any year in history.<br><br>Want to learn more?
