But what if you are left alone with many of these critters in a locked dungeon? There is only darkness, silence, and many small paws moving from wall to wall. And it seems that footsteps of a larger creature are heard nearby ...<br><br>Your task: to inspect the prison, check the condition of the prisoners, and stay alive, not allowing the darkness to come to you, otherwise you will lose your mind.",
