And therefore this is something that we would like to show that is true. With that objective in mind, we asked Mr. Grant Kirkhope to compose the main theme of the game. Soundtracks Grant Kirkhope (GoldenEye 007, Civilization: Beyond Earth, Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Attachment with a game is mostly done by music and we believe that musicality and feeling are key factors for that. Mr. Ryan McQuinn is incredible delivering those feelings in his compositions.
