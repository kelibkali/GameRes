Death traps are everywhere, some need to be deactivated, some can be avoided, and some are simply impossible to pass without dying. <br><br>But death wasn't the end. Every time she died, a strange machine brings her back to life. <br><br>It becomes clear that the only way for her to move forward through these horrible tests... is to die over and over again.<br><br><br>Death and Progress is a light horror game filled with puzzles and traps inspired by other Japanese horror RPG like Witch's House and Ib. Death is around every corner, but dying is not necessarily a bad thing, and sometimes it is the only way to proceed. Can you find your way through the traps?<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1125420/extras/7e625cce716c012aef3eafdad28cad7c.avif?t=1720503369\" width=619 height=155 /></span><br><br>- Find your way out through a series of puzzles and traps<br><br>- Three stages with varying environments<br><br>- Four different endings<br><br>- Unique death traps with different solutions<br><br>- Hidden solutions that opens up new ways to avoid traps<br><br>- Replay the levels for clues to escape a horrible fate",
