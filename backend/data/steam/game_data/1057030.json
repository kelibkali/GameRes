    "description": "WARNING: You can get caught playing this game for hours without a break...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nZombie apocalypse top down shooter...classic? Not really. You play brave cowboy who fights zombies. Story goes something like this: there was a mad scientist who experimented with human genes. He was so sure in himself that he tested his projects on himself. Almost get him dead...<br />\r\nLast project actually made him almost immortal. ALMOST! It made him a zombie. But wait, there is a catch. If he bites someone, that person becomes a zombie. You are one of the survivors, and your goal is to eliminate all the zombies, without getting killed. There comes in handy part with &quot;almost immortal&quot;. Your bullets can kill them. Also, I should mention that there are 6 types of zombies. And, yeah, you do not have any help because the rest of survivors are in a safe house long distanced from you. So, good luck...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nControls are basic: use your mouse to shoot, w a s d to move and r to reload. Everything else that you need to know, you will learn through playing.",
