Trains, in space. _space_train is an online multiplayer social experience, as you work together with others and against antagonists to keep the engines of progress ticking over as they deliver you from station to station. Embark as a simple passenger or take a longer-term role as a member of staff in an asymmetric gaming experience like no other.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChoose from a range of train scenarios and AI characters and set out on one of a range of procedurally generated scenarios. Perform your duties or go AWOL in a giant train made up of 10+ carriages on a dynamically changing map.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nComing 2022.",
