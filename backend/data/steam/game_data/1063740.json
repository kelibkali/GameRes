    "description": "Stick Royale is a 2D physics based rag-doll fighting game which started out as a small side project that I worked on in-between freelance web development and university. Get into insane gun-fights, blow your friends into oblivion and smack your friends with your bare hands, this all becomes so much more fun when your friends are all wobbly stick-men who struggle to walk let alone fight.<br><br>What? A Stick Fight: The Game ripoff!?!?<br>Stick Royale was inspired by Stick Fight and the battle royale genre. It is developed with permission from Landfall (the publishers of Stick Fight) and as such has been totally built from the ground up to support 100 players and eventually mobile play. It does not use any of Stick Fight's assets.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Ragdoll/Procedural Physics<br></li><li>Up to 100 players<br></li><li>Multiple multiplayer modes<br></li><li>Procedural Maps<br></li><li>Couch fighter</li></ul>",
