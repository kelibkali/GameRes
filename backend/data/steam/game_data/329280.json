Over the years we faced challenges, made mistakes and learned invaluable lessons along the way. Last year, we made the difficult decision to temporarily remove the game from the Steam store to embark on a complete rebuild. And during the upcoming Steam RTS Fest we are excited to share the first iteration of that process. If you are interested in testing it out, please read on to ensure you know what to expect.<br><br><strong>The Rebuild: A New Beginning</strong><br>Avalon Lords: Dawn Rises has been rebuilt from the ground up by a small, but passionate team of original and new developers. This is not a re-release of the old game but the beginning of an entirely new saga. While we’ve made significant progress, we want to be upfront: this is just the start.<br><br><strong>What to expect</strong><br>To set expectations correctly, here’s what the first iteration of the new build will offer:<br><br><strong>A Barebones Experience:</strong> The current version prioritizes core mechanics and stability over features and polish. Many systems are still in development and you’ll encounter placeholders and unfinished elements.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Foundational Gameplay:</strong> Expect minimal content at this stage. This release is focused on getting the basics right before expanding further. You can test the first mission of the campaign and test the systems in skirmishes. Multiplayer is available but is not properly balanced or polished.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Transparency Commitment:</strong> We’re committed to being open about the state of the game. While it is playable, it is not a full-fledged experience yet. Think of it as the foundation of what’s to come.<br><br><strong>Why release now?</strong><br>After being in bad shape for years and basically unplayable since we pulled it from the store, we felt it was essential to make something accessible again for those who have already supported us. By releasing the game during the Steam RTS Fest, we hope to re-engage with our community and invite new players to be part of this rebuilding process. It goes without questions that early supporters do not have to buy the game or any content again.<br><br><strong>Your Role in Shaping the Game</strong><br>We’re taking a community-centered development approach, and your feedback will play a critical role in shaping the future of Avalon Lords. Here is how you can help:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > Share your thoughts on gameplay mechanics, features and balance.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > Report bugs and technical issues to help us improve stability.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Suggest ideas for future content and improvements.</p></li></ul></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/329280/extras/99ecd5fbe3a830cefed56104ddb6a39c.avif?t=1737288992\" width=604 height=192 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Join our vibrant community in the heart of Avalon!
