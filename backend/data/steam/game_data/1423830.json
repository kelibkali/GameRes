    "description": "Cave crawl is an action-packed first-person melee adventure where you navigate your way through chambers of enemies to hopefully climb out alive. On the way you may find mysterious merchants who sell strange and curious items to aid you on your journey. <br><br><strong>Game mechanics</strong><br>Fight your way through 5 levels containing 4 rooms with random layouts of enemies and objects. Use your sword to defeat your enemies with either a slower heavy attack dealing more damage or a quicker attack dealing less damage. Deflect incoming damage with a well-timed deflect to be able to buy you some time for your next attack.   <br>If your back is against the wall you can always try to escape with a rechargeable dash to increase the distance between you and the enemy.  <br>Buy upgrades from the store to modify your sword to be longer for reach, heavier for dealing more damage, more health, faster attack speed or faster dash recharge.",
