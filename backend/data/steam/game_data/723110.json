    "description": "Scrap Galaxy is a local build-and-destroy deathmatch game for up to 4 players. It is a 2D top-down shooter taking place out in space in a galactic junkyard. In this setting, the players are trying to survive by constructing space ships.<br><br>The game is round-based and each round is divided up into two phases: build phase and battle phase. During the build phase, each player gets a number of components and has to assemble a spaceship from them within a certain time limit. During the battle phase, the players pilot the ships. They battle against the other or team up against the garbage drones living in the junkyard.<br><br>The randomness and unpredictable nature of the game makes every round into a new challenge, because you always have a new ship to battle with, raising the stakes and making the game quite addictive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Creativity under time pressure mixed with action-packed spaceship battles.<br></li><li>Deathmatch until only one player remains.
