    "description": "Prevent two kingdoms on the brink of war before all are annihilated. Build your own party, level up the team, and find hidden items to complete your quest of stopping the two kingdoms Estinos and Westinos. Solve a few puzzles and talk to people to find out more information about the two kings and what makes them tick in order to undo, deflect, avoid, or subvert all out war. This retro inspired RPG should give about around 2-3 hours of gameplay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome instances involve conflict, others can be avoided. Build up your characters or find the item that avoids all encounters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMultiple ways to stop the two kings from going to war and everyone wins, can you find them all?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy first video game, filled with Easter eggs and pop culture references. Made with RPG Maker MV!",
