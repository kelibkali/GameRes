    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > Pathfinder RPG - Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Taverns</h2><strong> Your Adventure Starts Here!</strong><br>Whether they're seedy bars in a city's roughest district, upscale joints where society's elites hobnob over artisan wines, or sleepy boozing establishments in pass-through villages, taverns are a staple of every adventurer's career. They're a place to meet contacts, to collect the juiciest gossip, or simply to knock back a hearty ale in between monster-slaying sessions.<br><i> Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Taverns</i> presents six ready-made, fully fleshed-out taverns for use in games that take place across Golarion. Each entry includes a full-page map of the establishment, stat blocks for both a commonly met tavern proprietor or bartender and a powerful local who might serve as a foe or an ally, a full history and description of the tavern's clientele, and a detailed gazetteer of the tavern's grounds. A selection of rules for bar fighting and pub games rounds out this invaluable tome.<br>This book contains details about the following taverns, and more:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Aeylinth Vineyard, a sophisticated treetop wine bar in the bustling city of Greengold, a prominent port of call in the elven nation of Kyonin.<br></li><li>Formidably Maid, a rough-and-tumble pirate bar located on the dockside outskirts of Port Peril, the capital of the privateer-infested archipelago known as the Shackles.<br></li><li>Runoff, an underground speakeasy in Starfall, where the drinks are spiked with mysterious fluids and the resistance against the Technic League is strong.<br></li><li>Whispering Stone, a partially open-air gambling hall and lounge in Osirion's Wati famous for the ancient, mostly buried statue that serves as its centerpiece.</li></ul><i> Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Taverns</i> is intended for use with the Pathfinder campaign setting, but it can be easily adapted to any fantasy world.<br><i> This product is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
