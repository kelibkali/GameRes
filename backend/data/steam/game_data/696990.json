    "description": "&quot;Two days ago a monster appeared in the hallway outside the office.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaybe if I just wait it will leave eventually.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInspired by other walking simulators like &quot;the static speaks my name&quot;, Food For Fear features very simple and accessible gameplay mostly involving walking and interacting with objects. It instead focuses on providing a dark and twisted horror story that explores the psychological nature of fear and entrapment. The game is very short so just play and judge it for yourself instead of reading this description.",
