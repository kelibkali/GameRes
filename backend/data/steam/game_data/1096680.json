    "description": "This simulation treats the Fear of Elevators as a claustrophobic problem. Claustrophobia is a fear of small spaces and/or being trapped in them. Many experience this fear as a suffocating sensation. The client can use touch controllers to push the elevator buttons and practice moving between floors. They can walk in and out of elevators either by walking in real life, or by using the touch controllers when physical space is too limited. The therapist can “break” and “fix” the elevator, stopping or restarting any of its movements or responsiveness. The top floor is the roof of a building overlooking a city.",
