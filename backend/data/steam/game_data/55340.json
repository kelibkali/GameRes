Instead, they have taken to the stars in mighty crusade fleets, actively seeking out the enemy throughout the Galaxy. -- The SPACE WOLVES are the most savage and barbaric of all the Space Marine Chapters, whose red-hot battle-lust is channeled through boltgun and frost axe. They are warriors of myth, whose noble deeds give rise to legends.",
