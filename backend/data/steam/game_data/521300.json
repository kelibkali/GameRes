Its a dangerous world, but our little Cephalopod has a trick up one of his eight sleeves: <strong>he can change his electric charge at will</strong>. Zoom across electric fields, twist through magnets, and use conductors to bend the world to your will.<br><br><strong>Never has the Right Hand Rule involved so many tentacles!​</strong><br><br>The game is based on the actual physics of Electromagnetism -- which means you'll be an expert in the topic by the end.  Or, well, you'll have beaten a game.  And isn't that enough?<br><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/521300/extras/29aa242c6a56f1ef15c7831a10f6c2a0.avif?t=1480533530\" width=580 height=274 /></span><br><br>This game has a Level Editor, and as the developer of the game, I see it as my duty to prove I can beat any level players throw my way.  So roughly each week, I load up a level and record myself trying to beat it.
