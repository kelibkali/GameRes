    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Starter Town Map Bundle 01</h2>The Starter Town Map Bundle 01 contains Day, Night and Unfurnished variants of 16 different maps from 4 different locations, all designed to help you set up your own 'Starter Town.' A combined total of 48 new maps for your campaign! Each map is highly detailed and contains inspiration for plot hooks, quest ideas, heroic deeds and nefarious activities.<br>This bundle includes:<br><strong> The Sanguine Dawn Inn</strong> - The Sanguine Dawn features everything you need for a restful stay. A roaring fireplace, a warm bath, a stage for travelling bards, comfy bedrooms upstairs with a view, a fully stocked kitchen, a secret trapdoor behind a bookcase leading to a hidden underground chamber and the sewers beyond.... wait, what?<br><strong> The Clenched Fist Blacksmith</strong> - The Clenched Fist is run by a giant of a human, Horst Blackfoot. Some say he has Goliath blood in him, but his thick black beard suggests otherwise. His wares are well renowned for their quality, but even so his home is luxuriously decorated for a humble blacksmith. Upon further investigation, or maybe just by asking nicely, the party might discover the underground bare knuckle fight club being run in his cellar.<br><strong> Ren?es Ravishing Raiments</strong> - For those looking to impress, there is only one store in town. Ren?e, a glamorous, seemingly ageless half-elf, tailor-makes all of her pieces from the finest elven silks and fabrics. For those she deems worthy (or at least wealthy) she also runs a VIP store stocked with hand selected magic items, spell scrolls and enchantments for the discerning adventurer. Anyone foolish enough to cross her, or try to steal from her, will quickly discover that the verdant greenery and plants around the house will sometimes bare their teeth!<br><strong> The Broken Compass General Store</strong> - Whether you are passing through and need a place to restock and freshen up, or are planning on sticking around a while to look for work, The Broken Compass offers everything you need! Cheap dorms rooms or tent pitches for the weary (and at a much fairer price than the snooty Sanguine Dawn!), stables for the horses, a Cartwright to mend your busted wagon (or build you a new one), and all the general goods you need for an journey on the road. If you're looking for a little distraction, or need to earn back that wagon money, the gaming hall below is open to all, and VIP rooms are available for those who can prove their financial clout. Just remember, cheaters<br><strong> will</strong> be caught, and very few come back unchanged after a visit to 'The Chair'.<br>Look out for my other Starter Town Map Bundles to complete the set, along with my asset packs to help reimagine the settings to suit your own needs.<br><i> Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by:</i><br><strong> Tom Cartos</strong><br><strong> Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and any ruleset. Compatible with Fantasy Grounds Unity",
