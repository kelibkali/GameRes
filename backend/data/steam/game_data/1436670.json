    "description": "<strong>Yohan Jager, composer of the Pumpkin Jack soundtrack</strong><br>&quot;The music of Pumpkin Jack is mostly orchestral. It is enriched by female choirs which add a supernatural and mysterious quality to the music, as well as world music instruments such as Oud, the Banjo or the Duduck to give characters a folkloric feel. Each character has its own melody, which you will find all along your playthrough to ensure cohesion with the game’s scenario. It was a real pleasure for me to create this Halloween themed soundtrack, to make it both immediately recognizable and unique, so close your eyes and enjoy this spooky voyage!&quot;",
