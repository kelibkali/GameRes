    "description": "Ever wondered how stealth games of the future will look like?<br>This is how. Safe Not Safe reinvigorates the genre in several fundamental ways.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Outsmart the revolutionary A.I.</h2><br>Modern games are still using decades-old technologies when it comes to Artificial Intelligence. It is time to fix this. <br><br>A.I. solution for Safe Not Safe was developed from scratch using the latest advances in Personalization and Machine Learning. A single smart A.I. agent controls the robotic security on a high level. The security learns from your actions, reacts to events, and develops smarter and stronger defenses on the fly.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1189370/extras/3a4552e818409aba8113388d63a0cc01.poster.avif?t=1651588338\" width=600 height=192 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1189370/extras/3a4552e818409aba8113388d63a0cc01.webm?t=1651588338\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1189370/extras/3a4552e818409aba8113388d63a0cc01.mp4?t=1651588338\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Unravel the mystery</h2><br>The Story is presented as a huge investigation board. Each node is a mission that, when completed, grows the narrative network in unique, non-linear ways depending on the mission outcome and your playstyle. The story grows based on how you play.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1189370/extras/c42c9631129ae815bfd3b09eba3f4bc2.poster.avif?t=1651588338\" width=600 height=192 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1189370/extras/c42c9631129ae815bfd3b09eba3f4bc2.webm?t=1651588338\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1189370/extras/c42c9631129ae815bfd3b09eba3f4bc2.mp4?t=1651588338\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Choose your tools</h2>Change the way you play the game by finding and stealing upgrades during the missions. Mix and match upgrades supporting three distinct playstyles:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Commando - Be direct and loud. Master the arsenal of firearms and heavy weapons.<br></li><li>Ninja - Bring silent violence or avoid the contact altogether. Traverse the levels by jumping between roofs and climbing walls.<br></li><li>Hacker - Exploit your environment by hacking anything. Disable, jam, distract the security or even turn your enemies against each other.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1189370/extras/1d5f229eb1f2c8f174f77f1f40ae4ca9.avif?t=1651588338\" width=600 height=192 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Find your way</h2><br>Too often missions in stealth games are designed like a puzzle. All you need to do is to find the “correct” pre-designed way to solve it.<br><br>In Safe Not Safe each mission is a personal challenge. The levels are generated just for you. The security A.I. is analyzing every infiltration you made and builds up defenses and challenges in unique and surprising ways. <br><br>Your skills and preparation are all that matter. Explore freely and find your own path to the goal without pre-designed solutions.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1189370/extras/53acbd135dc171985a91d2d134cc0f3d.poster.avif?t=1651588338\" width=600 height=192 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1189370/extras/53acbd135dc171985a91d2d134cc0f3d.webm?t=1651588338\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1189370/extras/53acbd135dc171985a91d2d134cc0f3d.mp4?t=1651588338\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>If challenging stealth gameplay is your thing - give our (very early alpha) demo a try.<br><br>Bring your best game! <br><br>Sign up to our newsletter for exclusive access to the next alpha builds.",
