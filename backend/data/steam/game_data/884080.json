This is our first game, and just finishing and releasing it is a big victory in itself. During this time, we came to know and love our little Berry, and we hope you'll do the same! If you need help, advice or just want to say hi - stop by our community hub. We'll be glad to meet you.<br><br>Yours truly,<br>Petra and Marin<br>Roadside Studio",
