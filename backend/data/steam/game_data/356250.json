    "description": "<strong>Gathering Sky</strong> is a playful, beautiful experience about a flock of birds on a journey across the sky. It starts with a single bird. Use your mouse to steer and grow your flock or let your birds find their own way. Dance in the winds of a far-away world and create an emotional story without words.<br><br>The world is brought to life by an original score by Dren McDonald performed by the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.<br><br>Gathering Sky is enjoyable with any skill level and can be finished in under an hour. <br><br>Fly with us.<br><br>",
