I'm Mathias and I've been creating video games since I was a child. I love coding, playing music and drawing. So what's better than creating a video game to do all of this at the same time? I do everything alone because I love every part of it and I'm a curious guy who likes to know how it works! I hope you'll like it :)<br><br>If you want to know more, check my blog",
