    "description": "***PAUSE THE EXPERIENCE TO CHANGE GRAPHICS SETTINGS AND REDUCE GRAIN***<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEPISODE ONE: THE CHAMPION<br />\r\nHalf music video. Half blurry nightmare. The first episode of Kingdom City Drowning is an experiment in soaking in atmosphere and just &quot;being there.&quot; Where narrative takes a back seat to the aggressive soundtrack, brutal visuals and oppressive tone. Follow James' escape from the confines of a deep underground prison mining complex to meet up with his only two kin, but an escape is not without cost. In order to attain freedom, James must first strike a deal with the devil. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nKINGDOM CITY - the last standing mega-metropolis in a world choked by a toxic haze, forcing man to endlessly create towering structures that reach into the heavens, grasping for pure air.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKINGDOM CITY DROWNING begins in the deepest, most depraved depths of Kingdom City, nearest the haze and desperation. Embody the camera as you follow three delinquents - James, Maika, and Brooks - bound by violence, trauma, love, and the desire to forge their way to the top by any means necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCREATED BY: William Gerardi and Barrett Phillips<br />\r\nSTARRING: Kentucker Audley, Sofia Banzhaf and Amin Joseph",
