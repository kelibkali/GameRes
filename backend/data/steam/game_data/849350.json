    "description": "<strong>Realistic Illusion</strong> is the first person player adventure game with stylized graphics. The game has a characteristic climate, little mysterious, little psychedelic, interweaving with fantasy themes. The story is told us by the environment and everything in the background. We can interact with it mainly thanks to our character’s detective mode. We still make things happen in the foreground. There is no problem in talking with anybody in the game. Realistic Illusion has a traditional dialogue system and detailed descriptions of items. The mechanics of the game has many interesting gameplay solutions like advanced minigames in which we can fight 1vs1 with other characters.",
