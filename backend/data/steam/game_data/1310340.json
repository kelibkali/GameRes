Will you make a gun that shoots sentry drones that chase and shoot enemies?  A gun that abducts people into the upper stratosphere?  Or maybe a gun that shoots yourself at the enemy, killing them with the impact damage.<br><br>\tThese aren't pre-made classes.  Players invent their own strategies.  Chances are you will come up with a playstyle the developer has never thought of.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1310340/extras/deef0dcdf33761553cc04dd6179857e7.avif?t=1672274558\" width=624 height=76 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1310340/extras/0f2b8b707cad0aa8b87a58ef6ff782d8.poster.avif?t=1672274558\" width=624 height=150 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1310340/extras/0f2b8b707cad0aa8b87a58ef6ff782d8.webm?t=1672274558\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1310340/extras/0f2b8b707cad0aa8b87a58ef6ff782d8.mp4?t=1672274558\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>\tYour base is a giant factory that you build with the Stack Gun.  You will use it to process loot into items that make you more powerful.

Want a gun that cuts off limbs?  A gun that shoots guns at people?  A gun that makes you fly?  Why not all 3 in one?  Combine any gun parts for whatever effects you want.<br></li><li>Get so much loot you need to <strong>design a factory</strong> to process it all.  No boring menus, you interact with your machines by doing sick wall-jumps and wall-slides on them.  Efficient production is radical!<br></li><li>Try out BILLIONS of <strong>procedural superpowers</strong>.  Can you find a use for that power that teleports all nearby bullets wherever you point?<br></li><li>You can bring as many friends as you want into <strong>online co-op</strong> to beat very challenging maps, assuming you aren't an incredible badass who has no friends.<br></li><li><strong>Infinite endgame</strong> lets you advance in power forever.  Start with &quot;normal&quot; FPS guns and before long you'll be accidentally killing yourself with nukes 10x the size of the map and running into walls at supersponic speeds.<br></li><li>Test your most irritating guns on your friends in <strong>deathmatch</strong>.  They can't be mad.  It's for science!<br></li><li>Run through enemies, wall-slide down skyscrapers, dismember robots, collect superpowers, launch people into space.  Every time there was a cool idea, it went in the game.</li></ul><br>After 7 years and over 16,000 hours working on this project it's almost ready. Stack Gun Heroes is my dream game. Hopefully it's yours too!<br><br>-Unstackd<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1310340/extras/ca5019dcac5063a8d0dafda006e61cee.avif?t=1672274558\" width=642 height=200 /></span>",
