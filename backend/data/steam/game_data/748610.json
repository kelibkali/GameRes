Like the first volume, we offer players a 3-dimensional air traffic control experience, from a control tower perspective. Push traffic as quickly as you can, while avoiding midair collisions. Choose good weather or bad, adjust the tower height to your preference, then do your best to manage jet traffic into and out of eight different real-world airports. Listen to human pilot voices as the aircraft obey your every command. Scan your radar screens for potential conflicts between aircraft, or use &quot;Sky Cam&quot; to observe the airport action from any perspective.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Volume Two offers the following airports:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >New York John F.
