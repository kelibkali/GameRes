    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Play Hide and Seek online with your friends!</h2><br>Hide and Seek is a first person multiplayer &quot;FPS&quot; game where you play hide and seek in various environments. Hide and Seek follows the traditional 1 Seeker vs many Hiders model of hide and seek that everyone is familiar with.<br>Hide and Seek was developed by a single developer! It took more than 2 years for the first release, and still is being developed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay</h2>As a <strong>Hider</strong> you have a short period of time to get away from <strong>Base</strong> after the round starts. The <strong>Seeker</strong> will be stuck in <strong>Base</strong> until that time expires. <strong>Base</strong> will then be locked for a period of time. During this time, all <strong>Hiders</strong> must try to stay away from the <strong>Seeker</strong>, who will be hunting for them. Once this <i>Hide Time</i> expires, <strong>Base</strong> will reopen and all <strong>Hiders</strong> must make it back before the round ends.<br><br>Hide and Seek requires an internet connection to play. You can host your server own through the in-game menus, or join one someone else is hosting. Don't see a server you like? Join up with some friends and host a LAN party.<br><br>Hide and Seek is 100% free to play. There are no costs to play or to host your own server.<br><br>If you wish to support the continued development of Hide and Seek consider purchasing a Hat or two.<br><br>Visit the Steam Community Hub to leave suggestions or feedback, find groups to play with, and stay up to date with all news.",
