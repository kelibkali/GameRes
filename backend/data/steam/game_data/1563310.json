Games in the genre typically focus on dance or the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen. Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble. While conventional game controllers may be used as input devices, rhythm games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat, with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1563310/extras/a4f625e669bc5c985624d165d207f837.avif?t=1682529951\" width=760 height=128 /></span><br><br>Gameplay<br><br>Playing the game is divided between finding a room to play in, selecting a song, and playing a song. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1563310/extras/292bbe6e01c0df12b2d1322a9d188499.avif?t=1682529951\" width=616 height=128 /></span><br><br>Playing a song<br><br>Horizontal bars slide down a series of six columns, each corresponding to a key S, D, F, J, K, L on the keyboard. Just before the notes hit the bottom of the column, the player has to hit the key corresponding to that column. Each keypress emits a note, vocal, or other instrument that creates a full-sounding song. A correct hit is also rewarded with a small 3D visual effect that is determined by the background on which the players are playing.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1563310/extras/9f1ef603c9e5c28bad8e3e3ce52a470c.avif?t=1682529951\" width=616 height=82 /></span><br><br>The grading scale used by the game is, from most accurate press to least, OK, Perfect and Miss. Consecutive OK and Perfect notes add both to the player's combo meter. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1563310/extras/f74f95904ac5d42d410a8c0fcbd6300b.avif?t=1682529951\" width=616 height=124 /></span>",
