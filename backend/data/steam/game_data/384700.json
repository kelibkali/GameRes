This is an adaptation of the DS and PSP releases. Below is an overview of the complete trilogy.</strong><br><br>The Umihara Kawase Trilogy, crafted by its original architects Kiyoshi Sakai and Toshinobu Kondo, encapsulates over two decades of gameplay history in a trio of physics-driven puzzle/platformers. Once a cult sensation in Japan, this indie gem is now accessible to a broader audience.<br><br>Step into the shoes of Umihara Kawase, a globetrotting Japanese sushi chef equipped with an unconventional set of tools: a fishing rod, stretchable fishing line, and hook. Embark on a journey filled with fish-like adversaries, conveyor belts, spikes, watery pits, time travel and more. Accumulate collectibles as you navigate towards the end of each intricate level. The deeper into this dream-like world that you venture, the more challenging the solutions and the greater the time pressure becomes. Keep an eye out for hidden paths and secret levels to unlock.<br><br>What truly distinguishes the Umihara Kawase Trilogy is the unique elasticity of Umihara's fishing line, offering unparalleled levels of mobility and exploration. The line's tension can be adjusted for precise maneuvers, making the difference between triumphant success and regrettable failure. Use these adjustments to stretch the limits of how far you can travel or to catapult yourself upwards.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/384700/extras/f534180f4cccca60f2148ac2bd0bf4a0.avif?t=1698769880\" width=600 height=332 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Trilogy Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Puzzle/platforming gameplay grounded in physics, demanding both quick reflexes and intellectual finesse.<br></li><li>Advanced elastic fishing-line mechanics for dynamic control.<br></li><li>A multitude of stages with branching paths across three full-fledged games.<br></li><li>Steam Workshop integration for all three titles, facilitating replay sharing.<br></li><li>Choose from four distinct characters in &quot;Sayonara Umihara Kawase.&quot;<br></li><li>Confront oversized, aquatic bosses such as a tadpole, a seahorse, and others.<br></li><li>Includes Steam Achievements, Trading Cards, Leaderboards, and Cloud Saving capabilities.<br></li><li>Comprehensive Steam controller support for each game (optional).</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/384700/extras/75ae2c0bcfe56cb8d963e75a787e2ac3.avif?t=1698769880\" width=600 height=332 /></span>",
