    "description": "You are a carefree astronaut with a sword, the Astro Knight. But because of you, your fellow astronauts came to an untimely demise. As you grapple with your loss, you find yourself in a dream world full of monsters. You must wield your sword and your special abilities to combat waves of foes. But after each stage you must give something up. Can you let go?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAstro Knight was made as part of the inaugural Hackubator class, a game accelerator program where we are split into teams of 5 and tasked with making a game in 3 months. Our team, House Rogue, embodies the values of competence and candor with a sizable helping of rebelliousness embodied by our mantra “Go left”.",
