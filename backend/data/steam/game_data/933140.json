    "description": "Drunkn Bar Fight on Halloween is holiday themed snippet of the VR game Drunkn Bar Fight.      This Halloween version is only one level\\bar without multiplayer.    We have added a few new weapons to help you stave off the zombie horde.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDrunkn Bar Fight is a simple, immersive, silly, rowdy party game. Take turns throwing bottles, darts, chairs, tip jars or anything else you can get your hands on at opponents. Or use those same items to smash the other patrons to the floor and then toss them through plate glass window. Enjoy performing socially unacceptable behavior without the resulting obligatory visits to the hospital, jail and courts. The only limits to the mayhem is your imagination and your moral decency.",
