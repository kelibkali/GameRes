    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>ADOM (Ancient Domains Of Mystery)</strong> is one of the most successful roguelike games ever created, boasting a brilliant mix of story, RPG, exploration, and intensely strategic and flexible combat. The Steam version adds various Deluxe features like achievements, difficulty level customization and various play modes (e.g. a story mode allowing to save and restore games, a weekly challenge game, an exploration mode and more). ADOM has been in development since 1994. In 2012 its development was revitalized with an immensely successful crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, now allowing us to offer ADOM both with ASCII and graphical modes enabling you to choose freely.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >ADOM is primarily known for being the first roguelike to include vibrant towns, NPC dialog, and quests, but it offers more than just a rich story line in a complex fantasy world: </p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >a huge game world with hundreds of locations such as towns, randomized dungeons, elemental temples, graveyards, ancient ruins, towers and other secrets </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >loads of races (dwarves, drakelings, mist elves, hurthlings, orcs, trolls, ratlings and many others) and even more classes (fighters, elementalists, assassins, chaos knights, duelists and much more) allowing for infinite play styles </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >hundreds of monsters and items, many with enhanced random features </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >a corruption system forcing you to balance lust for power with fear of damnation (corruptions slowly transform you into a vile monster but at the same time grant inhuman benefits - most of the time) </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >spells, prayers, mindcraft, alchemy, crafting and more </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >dozens of quests and branching story lines </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >numerous wildly different endings that might alter reality itself (simply drive Chaos away or slay a god or even become an immortal yourself, and others more)!</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >various game modes (story mode to be able to load and save games, challenge mode to face peculiar weekly challenges, exploration mode for a free wand of wishing and more)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >various customization options (turning hunger off, turning corruption off, modifying monster difficulty or treasure rates)</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >ABOUT THE ANCIENT DOMAINS OF MYSTERY</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Deep in the mountainous ranges of the Drakalor Chain, Chaos has broken through into Ancardia and it's up to you to decide the fate of the entire realm.

Yes, a very complete game. A multitude of endings, varied approaches to game play, thousands of starting combinations and an extensive storyline filled with endless details makes for an extremely satisfying experience that justly positions ADOM as one of the big five foundational roguelike games.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Is ADOM a finished game? No. As long as there is interest in the game we will continue to evolve and enhance it. In this respect ADOM differs from many other games on Steam in the best tradition of roguelike classics: We will continue to add both UI enhancements and new content to the core game in order to make it the most complete RPG ever.
