    "description": "<strong>WHAT IS IT?</strong><br>Dark, disturbing, unsettling - Beckett is a powerful narrative adventure game that gets under your skin and makes you question everything about yourself and the very nature of reality.<br><br>The game is a single-player, point-and-click style experience that lasts around 3 hours. But it will be in your head for a long time after.<br><br><strong>WHY WE MADE IT</strong><br>We made Beckett as a story that could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the best of literature, theatre and independent world cinema. It won the Games category in the 2018 BAFTA Scotland awards, made various game-of-the-year lists (2018) and was made part of V&amp;A Dundee's permanent gallery collection.<br><br>You could call it a psychological horror. You could call it an anti-love story. You could call it a surrealist nightmare. Beckett is a disturbing, unique experience that will make you question what it is to exist.<br><br>The game puts reality under the spotlight, drawing you into a missing person's case set in a dark and unforgiving world. Our main character, Beckett, morns the loss of his wife - she was everything to him, but time has passed and life has lost meaning. Then there's the City, which plays with Beckett like cat with a baby bird, making him act against his will. You must take control, explore, navigate, interact, talk, defy... we're all memories waiting to happen, we're all memories waiting to fade.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>PRAISE FOR BECKETT</strong></h2><i>&quot;A rare example of total and genuine auteurism in the games world&quot; - Glixel, Rolling Stone</i><br><br><i>&quot;convincingly uncompromised&quot; - Alphr</i><br><br><i>&quot;Beckett impresses at every turn.&quot; - Cubed3</i><br><br><i>&quot;An innovative and engrossing experience.&quot; - Russell Lees, creator of The Dark Eye</i><br><br><i>&quot;A powerful experience for those willing to dive into it.&quot; - Big Boss Battle.<br><br><i>&quot;The decisions that the game-player makes cause the story to squirm under the influence of the choices they make.&quot; - 3AM Magazine<br><br><i> &quot;Playing Beckett is wonderfully transcendent... It hones in on the disturbing and disgusting corners of society with little reprieve, making your stomach and your brain churn in tandem.&quot; - Rely On Horror<br><br><i>&quot;Always intriguing and defies the tried-and-true structure we’ve come to expect from adventure games.&quot; - Game Bias<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><u>Includes:</u></h2>- An original multi-layered story, discovered and reconstructed by the player and their imagination<br>- A dynamic narrative that responds to the way you play the story and interact with its world<br>- A bizarre and compelling world, filled with hand-made objects and artefacts<br>- A unique soundtrack and soundscape composed and aligned to the story and the world it exists in<br>- A pick-up-and-play interface, no gamer-skills necessary - just an inquisitive mind<br>- Questions about what it is to exist, the fragile nature of reality and the dark-humour that underpins life<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><u>Featuring:</u></h2>- Morgellon &amp; Ekbom Live Here - a short, interactive play, featuring the voice of John Otway (if you don't know it, you should check out his hit Really Free and its B-Side, Beware of The Flowers).<br>- Spectacular abstract environments to be explored and discovered, digitally painted by Herman Serrano (Weird Dreams, Chaos Engine, StarGlider)<br>- Illustrations by the incredibly talented Sean Mulvenna, and original screenprints by the fantastic Al White<br>- Programming by Gordon Bell (MotorStorm, The Shoot, Need for Speed: The Run)<br>- Design, direction, words, music and 'made-things' by Simon Meek (Slabovia.tv &amp; The 39 Steps)<br>- Access to the dark recesses of your own mind</i></i></i></i>",
