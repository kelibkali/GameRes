I’m so excited that you’re considering playing our game! I'll tell you as much as I can. So we're actually not the full game. We're the demo! No one knows if the real game is out yet or not, or what genre we're really supposed to be....it's kind of confusing. But that's just fine, I guess! Anyway, I suppose it's already been determined where you'll be going and what kinds of things you might be doing? I hope I get to actually meet you later. I've really been looking forward to it! Have a nice day!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1194740/extras/8cb2448e311462941c1d7e9364edae8e.avif?t=1738431587\" width=100 height=100 /></span><strong>HOPE:</strong> hey if u get any choices that lead u to a mochi store go there thats where the cool ppl in the game r if you dont youll probably lose ok bye</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1194740/extras/1204b4d7e9e2b83574348c1705768864.avif?t=1738431587\" width=100 height=100 /></span><strong>ASPEN:</strong> Hey YOU! Yeah, YOU! Wanna chat it up with some cute girls? (And a super cute non-binary person?) Then you've definitely found the right game! We're not like those other inferior dating simulators. We have the advantage of knowing who, how, why, and what we truly are! Well, uh...mostly. That's where you come in! You can be the one to tell us once and for all what we're really doing here! And with the help of your good buddy Aspen, we'll ensure that this game gets its best ending! Our fate rests upon your shoulders, O wise player!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1194740/extras/6bd2ad8c59bede722a162a1062f12f0e.avif?t=1738431587\" width=100 height=100 /></span><strong>NARI: </strong>[Declined to give a statement.]</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1194740/extras/a537fb856bca189f31daddeae6bf53e5.avif?t=1738431587\" width=100 height=100 /></span><strong>ISADORA: </strong>WHAT?!??!
