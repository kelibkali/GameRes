    "description": "Humanity discovers proof of extraterrestrial life within our own solar system, in the year 2045. This summer you are invited to join Nicole and Rocky in their tale of survival in a city overrun with extraterrestrials. In this Visual Novel you play as Nicole and also Rocky as they fight their way through dangerous streets and places. The extraterrestrials run on their primal animal instincts, and they are out for blood. You're in their zoo now, their research facility. You start out as Nicole and meet Rocky later on, but you can't trust him or can you? You certainly can't trust the extraterrestrials.  Who will you encounter? What will happen if you meet other people? Can you survive and make it out alive?",
