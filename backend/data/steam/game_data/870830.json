    "description": "Dark Inside is a multiplayer game in which you rob an abandoned town. You are one of the thieves who came to the town to steal whatever's left in that town. But thieves are unaware of each other. When they notice that, everything will be different. If you want you can steal jewelery and money in the houses and freely leave the town. Or you can take down the other thieves and stay longer in the town. In this option, the most helpful thing is the weapons that you can find inside the houses. Take down other thieves and take their loot or defend yourself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut what is the real purpose? The real purpose of abandoning town is the Anubis Statue. Finding it is dream of all thieves because it is way more precious than other loots. Just the statue can make you rich!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLoot as you can and climb the ladders of thievery. Play to the top and be most talented thief in the world!",
