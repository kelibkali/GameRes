    "description": "Nobunaga’s Ambition, a series synonymous with Historical Simulation Games, has now released an extension of the 13th release in that series, Nobunaga’s Ambition: Tendou, at the Steam Store as Nobunaga’s Ambition: Tendou w/Power-up Kit!<br />\r\nOn a beautiful 3D map of Japan, players not only fight over castles, but also find a new strategical element in fighting to whittle down their opponent’s territory. For the power-up kit, we have added a new element, “Culture,” that expands the depths of the game’s strategies. Battles become deeper, more brilliant and more exciting.<br />\r\nThe popular edit mode has been upgraded. <br />\r\nAnd with the AI Editor, a series first, you can even adjust how the computer itself thinks.",
