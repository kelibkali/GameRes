When the book goes missing on Hemlock’s first night at the castle, everyone becomes a suspect and Hemlock must explore a castle where secrets hide in the shadows and a dark history waits to be discovered.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nSolve puzzles as you search for clues and explore the many rooms of the castle. Travel to the nearby village of Krkanov, where gossip about the castle points to an ominous past. As your investigation continues, you begin to unravel a mystery much greater and far more disturbing than a stolen book.",
