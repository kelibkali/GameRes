Those people were wrong about 2 things:<br><br>First - There are no elephants. That is silly. There is only the Turtle.<br>Second - Our world is just a planet, but there is another beautiful place wandering space, that is similar to Earth and rests on the Turtle.<br><br>An unprecedented economic war for territories and resources flares up on the turtle.<br>Will it and all life on it die in the chaos of pollution?<br>Or will intelligent beings come to their senses and prevent the end of the world by developing new technologies?<br><br><strong>Pollute and Conquer</strong>, compromise and cleanse.",
