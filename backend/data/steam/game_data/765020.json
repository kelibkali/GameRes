    "description": "Immerse yourself in a world where everything is dice! The floors, the doors, even YOU!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere Are Dice is a captivating indie dice-puzzler that offers a unique twist on classic logic and strategy games. In this intriguing world, players navigate through labyrinthine levels, manipulating dice that intriguingly contain smaller dice within them, much like Matryoshka dolls. This innovative mechanic introduces a multi-layered puzzle experience, where each move is both a challenge and a revelation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game begins with straightforward puzzles, gently introducing the player to its mechanics. As you progress, the complexity escalates, transforming simple tasks into intricate brain teasers. &quot;There Are Dice&quot; is not just a game; it's a journey of discovery and intellect, designed to stimulate and surprise even the most seasoned puzzle enthusiasts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game was born out of the creative challenges of the 2021 GMTK Jam. In a serendipitous twist, the 2022 GMTK Jam's theme was &quot;Roll the Dice,&quot; aligning perfectly with our project. Rather than starting anew, we decided to polish and perfect &quot;There Are Dice,&quot; ensuring every level, every puzzle, every roll is a testament to our dedication to innovative game design. Prepare to think outside the box, roll the dice, and unravel the mysteries within in &quot;There Are Dice.&quot;",
