She attends the Silvestri Schooledge, and lives in a nice house in Meow Village on Catmouth Island. She wants to find out more about the islands' neighbourhood, environment, its mostly unknown past, and investigate what the secretive <i>B3 Corp.</i> is up to, all the while juggling her studies as not to end up like the steak house girl. <i>:3</i><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/336380/extras/3c7a34e6d074d48f3140b8175f2d6732.avif?t=1447365662\" width=270 height=480 /></span><br><br>This game follows the same convention as most classic point-and-click games like <i>Sam &amp; Max: Hit The Road</i>,<i> Day of The Tentacle</i> and <i>Monkey Island</i>, except that it addresses a few of the issues with trying every object in the inventory together to see if they work, and a few other things.<br><br>It is created in a low-poly graphical style in which as few polygons as possible have been used to create objects.
