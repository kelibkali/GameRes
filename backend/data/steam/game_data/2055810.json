Have you tried studying but feel like you aren't getting anywhere?<br><br>In So to Speak, you use context clues to guess the meaning of what you see and hear. Unlike other games and tools, meanings aren't revealed immediately. Every word is its own puzzle - to proceed, you must connect it to nearby objects or text with the same meaning. For example, you can drag a Japanese sign for &quot;entrance&quot; onto an actual building entrance located nearby or the English word &quot;entrance&quot; in the game's description of the entrance.<br><br>The game is a love letter to the Japanese language and the experience of wandering alone in another country. There are no drills, no fights, no minigames, and no distractions. The entire game is a series of situations, and each one helps you discover the meaning of something new.",
