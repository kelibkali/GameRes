This option is not sticky, so you need to turn it on each time to start (you know, for the kids)</strong><br><br>Hey *beephead*! Ransome the Clown here to let you in on a little secret about Thimbleweed Park: this game’s developers are *beepholes*. They thought your sensitive ears wouldn’t be able to handle my *beeping* language. Well, I have two words for those *beepers* -- &quot;*Beep* you&quot;!<br> <br>With my new Ransome *Unbeeped* DLC, you can now play Thimbleweed Park in all its uncensored glory. I’m not talking about new content, deleted scenes, or alternate endings -- this isn’t a *beeping* director’s cut. What you will get is the same great game with none of the *beeping* beeps drowning out my lines.<br><br>You heard that right: pure, uncensored Ransome the *Beeping* Clown! Because let’s face it, even if I am stuck sharing the spotlight with four losers, I’m the real star of this *beeping* game.<br> <br>So don't let those *beephead* developers call the shots! Grab the Ransome *Unbeeped* DLC and you’ll see that in Thimbleweed Park, *beeping* is the least of your problems.<br><br>NOTE: The subtitles still have *beeps* in them. Only the English audio is uncensored.",
