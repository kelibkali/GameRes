    "description": "Amoeba Battle is a new breed of RTS game where you control amoebas as they battle against the infection that threatens their realm. Explore beautiful yet alien landscapes to feed and strengthen your fledgling amoebas!<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >EXPLORE AND FEED:</h2>Find algae for herbivores, go hunting with carnivores, or just eat everything with omnivores! Once an amoeba has eaten enough food, it becomes well fed. A well fed amoeba does more damage, but more importantly, it can replicate into two amoebas!<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/730860/extras/0d996d5529aa90fa056c86378b2e91a7.poster.avif?t=1593545896\" width=620 height=266 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/730860/extras/0d996d5529aa90fa056c86378b2e91a7.webm?t=1593545896\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >AMOEBAS DON'T NEED BASES:</h2>Unlike other RTS games, there are no bases to build - amoebas don't build houses or towns after all! New amoebas are created through the miracle of binary fission; well fed amoebas can replicate into two identical amoebas, doubling your army with a click of the mouse! <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/730860/extras/baba3f6c395057a67677ae2b4dc825c2.poster.avif?t=1593545896\" width=620 height=266 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/730860/extras/baba3f6c395057a67677ae2b4dc825c2.webm?t=1593545896\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >MUTATION IS EVOLUTION:</h2>Multiplying amoebas won't always be enough.

New to RTS? Or perhaps an RTS master? Choose from four difficulty levels to tailor your experience. <br></li><li>CO-OP ROGUELIKE CAMPAIGN MODE:<br>Outbreak is a roguelike RTS campaign mode that can be played solo or co-op with up to two friends. In an Outbreak campaign, you will traverse a randomized microscopic world with dynamically generated missions. Outbreak is designed to have endless replayablity, and no two campaigns will ever play out the same!<br></li><li>CROSS-PLATFORM MULTIPLAYER:<br>Compete against other players in our 18-player Battle Royale Versus mode or take on the AI in Skirmish, either solo or with up to two friends, across console or PC.<br></li><li>INNOVATIVE RTS GAMEPLAY:<br>Unlike other RTS games, there are no bases to build - you will need to feed, multiply, and evolve your amoebas to claim victory. Every amoeba is not just a fighter, but a potential army via the miracle of binary fission. And through the power of evolution, even the lovable Locust can grow and evolve into an unbreakable Ursa!<br></li><li>IMPACTFUL TACTICAL DECISIONS:<br>Utilize the inherent adaptations of herbivores, omnivores, and carnivores to your advantage, such as carnivore stealth and omnivore mobility. Make use of special terrain features, like Spawning Pools that cut replication times in half. Turn the tide of battle with deployable Probes, such as Cryo Probes that slow enemies to a crawl.<br></li><li>DELIGHTFUL ART STYLE:<br>Journey through four exotic landscapes and battle with nine species of amoeba, all delicately rendered using a remarkable fusion of watercolors and pixel art. <br></li><li>FAMILIAR RTS CONTROLS:<br>Employ fully featured keyboard + mouse controls including control groups, box selection, hotkeys, waypoint queues, and more. If you prefer joysticks and buttons, feel free to plug in a controller instead! </li></ul>",
