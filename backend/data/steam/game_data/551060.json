A sleepy town called Creekside. A mysterious whirring jolts you from your sugar coma. As you peer out the window, wiping the sleep from your eyes, you question your sanity: Hordes of Creeps assemble around ominous antennas! Where are the cops?! Where are the adults?! Is no one going to stop this?! It turns out that the nefarious Dr. Apollyon opened a portal to the Bottomless Pit. It’s going to be up to you to stop Dr. Apollyon before he takes over the world! But first, save Creekside so we can all get back to trick-or-treating!<br><br>You play as a reluctant, middle-school hero named Squirt who awakens on Halloween to discover his town overrun by Creeps. Squirt’s weapons of warfare are randomized guns and costumes with unique abilities. Squirt’s gun has randomized attributes; deplete Squirt’s ammo, and Squirt will automatically switch to another randomized gun. Collect upgrade tokens to permanently unlock new ammo types. Roguelite means lots of deaths, but store upgrades, ammo unlocks, costume unlocks and money carryover. Five distinct zones make up Creekside; complete objectives to advance to the next zone.<br><br>Creekside Creep Invasion garners inspiration from the gameplay of Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne; the contemporary sub/urban setting of old school games like  TMNT arcade, Zombies Ate My Neighbors, and River City Ransom; and a dash of the whimsy of EarthBound mixed in.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/551060/extras/348d62f2259fbe6c726bd468de29c11b.avif?t=1666986392\" width=480 height=80 /></span><br><strong>Features include:</strong><br><strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Full story between levels; set in 1989 on Halloween night.<br><br></li><li> Four difficulty modes.<br><br></li><li> Randomized guns with over 20 unique ammo types and combo versions that transform when you reload.<br><br></li><li> Your gun randomizes ammo type, single shot, double shot, triple shot, combo shot(2 ammo types at once), bullet speed, rate of fire, range and damage every time you reload.<br><br></li><li> Upgrade seven stats and find power-ups, rare power-ups and power-downs.<br><br></li><li> Over 100 perk based armor pieces to find and equip in five armor slots. <br><br></li><li> Armor is equipped on pick up replacing your current armor with you only knowing what you got after you equip it, some armor has negative attributes.
