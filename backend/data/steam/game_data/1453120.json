    "description": "Perilous Warp Soundtrack is a mix of acid, glitchy, and distorted sounds. The composer Daniel Northwood gets his inspiration from late 1990's, early 2000's soundtracks, the times when games used to have freedom in music. The soundtrack includes 15 original electronic tracks, each with a special touch. Nearly an hour of atmospheric sci-fi music designed for fighting aliens, suitable for standalone listening as well. Available in both MP3 and FLAC formats.",
