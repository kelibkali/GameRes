    "description": "Aliens. They showed up uninvited. They are taking over. They are everywhere. Earthlings are in trouble. They need to push back and take the fight back to them, to the alien home-world. A stealth super-weapon developed at Area 51 has been proven to deliver on the promise. What is that weapon?  BINGO!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYes, a classic game of BINGO! Play One, Two, or Three BINGO cards! Flick the ball at the matching number on the card to daub. Toss a ball away from the card to discard. Connect a full line of daubs in a row, diagonal, or a column to make a BINGO and get a new card!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow can BINGO! defeat aliens, you ask? It would be too complicated to explain here, but it is awe-inspiring. Aliens don't like losing, and especially when playing BINGO!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach BINGO! gets earthlings closer to the goal of defeating aliens. Each card is a ticket to success. Make your way to the alien council. Close it out.",
