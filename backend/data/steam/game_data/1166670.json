    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Reach Adventure 2: Theories of Everything</h2>Set in the Sindal Subsector featured in the recently released Core Rulebook, Theories of Everything is an exciting and memorable adventure set in the Trojan Reach.<br>The Travellers' mission is thus more than merely running the ship and helping collect data. They will need to be advisors, diplomats and bodyguards too, injecting a little common sense into the heady mix of ego and brilliance aboard Insight III. The storyline of the adventure is as much about the interactions of the scientists and crew as the situations they find themselves in, and it may be that the Travellers' greatest challenge will be keeping the scientists from murdering one another...<br>Includes two new vehicles: the Sealed Air/Raft and the Electric Dirt Bike.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong></strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Traveller 2E (Mongoose) ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
