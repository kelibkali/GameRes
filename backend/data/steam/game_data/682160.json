The child can adopt and take care of a lost caterpillar egg and raise it to a beautiful butterfly. This process will teach the child what it takes to look after a pet properly.  They can earn coins by carrying out chores and looking after the pet. If neglected the pet does not die it just looks sad and uncared for.  The game includes activities with positive affirmations which will develop children’s reasoning, reflexes, co-ordination and motor skills <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe always welcome your suggestions about how we can improve The Butterbies simulation and add new features and cool stuff. If you have any issues with the game, just contact us and we will help.",
