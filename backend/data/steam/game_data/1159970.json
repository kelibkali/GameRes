Get or exchange resources, construct buildings, watch your people’s fatigue levels, and keep them alive. Every day there are random events that require your attention. Over time, crushing storms begin, and you have to prepare for each one.<br><br><strong>DO YOUR BEST TO SURVIVE</strong><br><br>When the Old King died, an enemy invaded the country. You, the captain of the Royal Guard, were among those who decided to fight. And you lost. They saved your life but exiled you to the edge of the world. Now, this is your home. Take command of people living in the abandoned castle on the edge of the desert. Build relationships and help them survive in these harsh conditions. Unravel the mysterious past of the Old Man, the oldest dweller of the castle. Accept or give battle to your destiny under the scorching sun of the hottest summer in history.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159970/extras/c86127defbb7a527d654116627959fec.poster.avif?t=1638821224\" width=600 height=160 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159970/extras/c86127defbb7a527d654116627959fec.webm?t=1638821224\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159970/extras/c86127defbb7a527d654116627959fec.mp4?t=1638821224\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>CONTROL YOUR RESOURCES</strong><br><br>Survival in the desert requires concentration and attention. Don’t let food and water run out - without them, only death awaits you. Upgrade buildings, reduce rations, send caravans with goods to exchange - do whatever it takes to survive!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159970/extras/92f01def6feed401f74e728e1b48ac58.poster.avif?t=1638821224\" width=600 height=160 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159970/extras/92f01def6feed401f74e728e1b48ac58.webm?t=1638821224\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159970/extras/92f01def6feed401f74e728e1b48ac58.mp4?t=1638821224\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>SAVE STRENGTH</strong><br><br>Don’t let people exhaust themselves or stop trusting you. The people here are harsh, just like the desert. If your energy drops to zero, you will get killed. If people stop trusting you, they will start stealing resources for their survival. Construct buildings where they can rest and give people days off. Do not let this story end too quickly.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159970/extras/dbe2c57f64e03ce5b340ada897ec4af8.poster.avif?t=1638821224\" width=600 height=148 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159970/extras/dbe2c57f64e03ce5b340ada897ec4af8.webm?t=1638821224\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159970/extras/dbe2c57f64e03ce5b340ada897ec4af8.mp4?t=1638821224\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING</strong><br><br>The desert is a strange and dangerous place. Only a cold-blooded and patient one can survive here. Each turn, you have to make difficult decisions and bear the blows of fate. There are dozens upon dozens of random events that occur at the beginning of each turn.<br><br><br><strong>THINK SEVERAL MOVES AHEAD</strong><br><br>There is a cloud of locust on a horizon. What should you do? You can upgrade food storage in tech tree, stop food production to reduce their amount naturally, send food away in trade caravan or take corn (food) and make bread from it. You will always have several options to do. Your plans will often be overset, but you won't survive without them. When resources are scarce, you will have to decide what to improve first, sacrificing everything else.<br><br><strong>BUILD YOUR OWN STORY</strong><br><br>Each of your choices will be taken into account. They will affect what story you get and where you will bring yourself and the inhabitants of the castle.<br><br><strong>IT ONLY GETS WORSE</strong><br><br>No matter how tough and wise a commander you are, you can never change one thing. Nature. The weather changes, and in your case, not for the better. Get ready to face crushing thunderstorms and protracted droughts, deadly storms, and ravenous locusts. Each event requires its own approach and preparation. And may the gods have mercy on you!<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159970/extras/cca2e30f62c496e721e45a3b0978d918.poster.avif?t=1638821224\" width=600 height=134 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159970/extras/cca2e30f62c496e721e45a3b0978d918.webm?t=1638821224\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159970/extras/cca2e30f62c496e721e45a3b0978d918.mp4?t=1638821224\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
