    "description": "Have you ever played a brick breaking arcade action game against another player?  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHave you ever had to make a split second decision on whether to use your paddle to reflect a ball or drop to your knees to blow attack your opponent?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHave you ever had to make a choice between choosing a huge &quot;P size&quot; at the cost of slowed mobility?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWelcome to &quot;Prison Ball: Full Blown&quot; where the objective is simply to score more points than your opponent when the timer expires!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers on each side of the screen fight for control of three balls which score points when they break the bricks in the middle and the balls only score points for the player who last reflected the ball with their paddle.  If your opponent is doing a good job at controlling the balls, you can drop to your knees and do a blow attack towards your opponent and if you are successful, they will be stunned in a block of ice giving you the opportunity to steal control of the balls!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrison Ball: Full Blown is an indie game made from the heart that offers both lots of laughs and barrels of fun!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game features Full Local Player Convenience!  Both local players can play at a single keyboard (WASD and Arrow keys) OR One player can use the keyboard and the other can use a controller, OR Both players can use controllers!  The choice is completely up to you and what works best for you!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCONTROLS:  (Keyboard)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayer 1:  W = UP // S = DOWN // D = launch blow attack when bar is full (bottom left) // WASD controls your blow attack once launched<br />\r\n                If Playing as DLC character Vast Shadows, pressing the SPACE BAR when you get the &quot;Balls Out!&quot; indicator will split your ball into 3 additional balls in your opponents face!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayer 2:  ^ = UP // V = DOWN // &lt; = launch blow attack when bar is full (bottom right) // arrow keys controls your blow attack once launched<br />\r\n                 If Playing as DLC character Vast Shadows, pressing the RIGHT SHIFT when you get the &quot;Balls Out!&quot; indicator will split your ball into 3 additional balls in your opponents face!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCONTROLS:  (Controller)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLeft stick or direction pad to move player up and down to hit ball or dodge blow attacks //  A Button launches your blow attack, left stick controls it after launched<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf Playing as DLC character Vast Shadows:  Pressing the X button when you get a &quot;Balls Out!&quot; indicator on screen will split your ball into 3 additional balls in the face of your opponent!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCounter to playing DLC character Deborah Fire:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDeborah Fire can ignite balls with her flaming paddle and these fire balls can in turn ignite bricks.  Bricks on fire will slowly burn up and if destroyed by fire will give Deborah points that can turn the game in her favor very quickly.  To counter this, try to hit her burning bricks with your own ball which on impact will cause a massive explosion, giving YOU all the points destroyed in that explosion!  You'll easily see all the points you get in these counter explosions because the points floating from the destroyed bricks will be double in size as they float upwards.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCounter to playing DLC character Vast Shadows:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVast Shadows can turn a lost ball of his color into his advantage by timing his active ability button press well, which will split his ball into three additional balls in your face!  They will all be his color and almost impossible for you to deflect them all!  They will score points for him as any other ball his color, but if you can change these Vast shadow balls your color by deflecting them, they will score points for you instead.  Also if a Vast ball that you've changed to your color hits an interior pink brick, you'll instantly destroy his shadow ball and this will cause a blinding search light to shine on him for several seconds.  While this light may not seem like much, it can blind his ability to see and deflect balls near him and might just turn things back in your favor!",
