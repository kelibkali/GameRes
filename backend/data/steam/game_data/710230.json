    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Can you push back against fate, survive among ruthless gangs, and fight back a zombie horde with only a handful of militia fighters to rely on?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Urban Strife is a turn based tactical survival RPG that blends old school strategy, shelter management, and a grounded RPG storyline. Built on Unreal Engine, it features real ballistic simulation, day and night cycles, dynamic fire spread, advanced sound and smoke behavior, and NPCs with their own needs, morale, hunger, and sickness. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You are not chosen. You survive because others pull you back from the edge.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >STORY AND SETTING</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You begin as a mysterious patient evacuated by the CDC from an Atlanta lab shortly before the city falls. Half dead, you are rescued by the people of Urban Town, a small southern settlement barely holding together.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Their shelter is ruined. Supplies are low. Tension is rising.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You must rebuild the shelter, organize its people, and give them a reason to endure. As stability returns, you venture into the city to negotiate alliances or confront hostile factions. Every decision has lasting consequences.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A massive zombie horde is moving toward the town. Atlanta has already fallen. Urban is next.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >REAL BALLISTICS</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/710230/extras/1c8e4c9e95da7e14b5cac3324d8ea614.poster.avif?t=1770066161\" width=616 height=246 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/710230/extras/1c8e4c9e95da7e14b5cac3324d8ea614.webm?t=1770066161\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/710230/extras/1c8e4c9e95da7e14b5cac3324d8ea614.mp4?t=1770066161\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Urban Strife features realistic ballistic simulation across all firearms.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Weapons behave according to projectile travel, penetration, and impact. Cover matters. Sound and visibility shape every encounter. Poor positioning and wasted shots are punished.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The arsenal includes handguns, shotguns, SMGs, assault rifles, hunting rifles, and sniper rifles. Each class serves a distinct tactical role. Pistols excel through low action point costs and sustained damage. Shotguns deliver devastating close range power through individual pellet impacts. Rifles dominate at range but demand rare and expensive ammunition.<br>  </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >BODY PARTS TARGETING</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/710230/extras/467b6f79afb81c89b3b63f21287c697e.poster.avif?t=1770066161\" width=616 height=174 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/710230/extras/467b6f79afb81c89b3b63f21287c697e.webm?t=1770066161\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/710230/extras/467b6f79afb81c89b3b63f21287c697e.mp4?t=1770066161\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Combat allows precise targeting of enemy body parts. Before you pull the trigger, you get an advanced Chance-To-Hit calculator that estimates both your percentual odds and your potential damage (taking bullet attenuation in consideration). Your skills, perks and weapon attachments can improve these even further.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Assault rifles can deliver heavy cumulative damage in burst fire, including multi target penetration when used correctly. Sniper and hunting rifles reward careful aim with instant kills or crippling injuries.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Targeting limbs can slow enemies, disable attacks, or create openings. Headshots are lethal but risky. Success depends on positioning, timing, and resource management.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >How much fun this system is depends entirely on which side of the barrel you are on.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >MELEE ATTACK MODES</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/710230/extras/b443625d0ea087c633636af8748e2cd6.avif?t=1770066161\" width=616 height=346 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Firearms are not always an option. Urban Strife allows almost anything that can be wielded to function as a melee weapon.

They follow routines, form relationships, and pursue personal goals. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Some are willing to help you, but only if you serve their interests first. Everyone has an agenda. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Three major factions compete for control of the city. Army rebels, a zombie worshipping cult, and a ruthless biker gang. You may choose one as an ally and benefit from their unique shelter upgrades and trade offers. The others will become enemies.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >No alliance is clean.
