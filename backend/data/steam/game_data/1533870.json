Fly in on your helicopter, fight the monsters, and save the princess of Atrius from the evil scientist Dral.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Challenging AI</h2>The monsters in Atrius Star are built upon a concept called &quot;orthogonal unit differentiation&quot;.  This means each unit operates in a unique way causing you to make meaningful decisions to defeat each one.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Fun Weapons</h2>The weapons in Atrius Star include a chainsaw, rifle, shotgun, SMG, rocket launcher, and grenade launcher.  Each weapon has its own strength, weakness, and cool down mechanic causing you to regularly switch between weapons to survive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Monster Infighting</h2>If enough chaos ensues or monsters are manipulated just right, they will start to fight each other.  It's a truly satisfying event that creates laughs and saves you ammo.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Speed Running</h2>With each game timed, you can get endless replayability by trying to beat your all-time best.",
