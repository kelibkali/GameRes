    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >STAR-BOX – RPG Adventures in Space!</h2><br><strong>Strap on your gravity boots, power up your laser, and climb aboard your spaceship for a retro-styled, RPG-jaunt into the unknown! Travel around an open-world, sandbox universe where you are the architect of your own story. </strong><br><br>Fly around an infinite universe exploring alien worlds, abandoned cities, overrun space-stations, derelict ships, and parallel dimensions with little more than your trusty laser and inept, mechanical bodyguards. Collect and equip hundreds of items, weapons, and armours to help you on your journey. Get swept along in the politics of the year 4135 and lead a rebellion against a corrupt government and powerful corporations. Fight and capture 19 enemy vessels in tactical, bridge-based combat, and hire crew members to boost your fighting skills. Fall foul of strange spatial anomalies, giant space-fish, and human-hating AI programs through dynamic events that can strike at any time. Chose to work for Oberon Bounties and hunt down the scum and villains of the universe, for the Collector’s Guild, Earth Military, or for the mysterious Cicero recently awoken from a 2000 year cryo-nap. And if you fancy a challenge: play the game in ‘Ironman Mode’ where you only get a single chance at making it big.<br>Features:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A FULL SANDBOX EXPERIENCE:</h2><br><strong>Explore space, untethered by a constricting story:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Choose your gender, starting vessel, and the company that raised you.<br></li><li>Undertake many exciting missions which include: boarding space-stations, killing their crew and stealing their tech.<br></li><li>Hunting down ferocious beasts on alien worlds.<br></li><li>Visiting alien shrines built on ancient asteroids.<br></li><li>Steping foot on abandoned medical ships where the undead roam the corridors.<br></li><li>Fighting in tactical bridge-based space battles where you can capture new ships or destroy your enemy and use their hull for scrap. <br></li><li>And searching for illegal, low-tax settlements to avoid paying the 100% tax imposed by Earth Gov on all purchases.</li></ul><br><strong>Find hundreds of items:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Pick alien flowers for healing chemicals or useable genetic material.<br></li><li>Salvage scrap metal to repair and upgrade your mechanical bodyguards<br></li><li>Equip armours, lasers, and grenades to make exploring space less dangerous.<br></li><li>Find and use futuristic drugs to boost your skills and health.</li></ul><br><strong>Chose to work for companies or go it alone:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Explore random sectors of space where pirates roam and plunder is there for the taking.<br></li><li>Work for Oberon Bounties and hunt down criminals on alien worlds, spacestaions, or in powerful ships.<br></li><li>Join the Collectors Guild and bring back strange objects in return for special armours.<br></li><li>Join Earth Military and gain discounts on tax, and access new specialist ships.<br></li><li>Seek out and work for Cicero: the man with a mission to change the universe.</li></ul><br><strong>A non-compulsory storyline</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>All humans are pledged into a company at the age of five and don’t see their family for the next 20 years.
