The hero has only five minutes to gain the most medals and to defeat as many warriors as possible. In addition to the danger of being defeated, the hero risks falling into the abyss and losing accumulated honor points. The hero is armed with a long two-handed sword and is able to jump high. And enemies can both strike with a sword and shoot from a crossbow, trying to throw a brave knight into the abyss.",
