    "description": "<i>&quot;I’m a 90s kid who didn’t get the chance to know the <strong>fantastic 80s</strong>. <strong>Starxium 20XX</strong> is a tribute to those <strong>fantasized years</strong> when everything seemed just fine, with lots of <strong>vibrant colors</strong>, <strong>bright neons</strong> and <strong>dreamy synths</strong>.&quot;</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1019840/extras/9cc0b865e670dd28ee1e19b6bd44f7af.avif?t=1549101718\" width=640 height=250 /></span></h2><br><br><strong>Starxium 20XX</strong> is a capture the point (your team needs to stay on a point and repel your opponent), where the point is a <strong>moving convoy</strong> that runs at <strong>200km/h</strong> in the middle of a big highway. It's <strong>not</strong> a racing game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1019840/extras/8a87c401ea8093ef67e912217cafa4f0.avif?t=1549101718\" width=640 height=250 /></span></h2><br><br>The game is highly reminiscent of the <strong>80s</strong> with its neon lit nights and boasts original <strong>synthwave music</strong>. Its strong visual and sound identity allow the game to be appreciated by a growing community of <strong>retro lovers</strong> who crave the <strong>80s pop culture</strong>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1019840/extras/a4ef62cc86051575c6a1004f3bfb7f32.avif?t=1549101718\" width=640 height=250 /></span></h2><br><br>It is a multiplayer game meant for <strong>esport</strong>: it’s made to be as fun to <strong>play</strong> as it is to<strong> watch</strong>. The main game mode is played with 4 players versus 4. You'll need some <strong>strategy</strong> and good <strong>communication</strong> to fight the enemy team.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1019840/extras/3313a76de30651dd812f920bebd4967f.avif?t=1549101718\" width=640 height=250 /></span></h2><br><br>Everyone gets the <strong>same car</strong> but what you do with it is your business. And you can <strong>totally customize it</strong>, not only the skin, but everything from the wheels to the motor, from the chassis to the battery, and so on. Each part comes from one of the <strong>27 country manufacturers</strong>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1019840/extras/8ef83926b827bcc1b8995c971330e31a.avif?t=1549101718\" width=640 height=188 /></span></h2><br><br>To repel your opponents, you can simply <strong>rush over them</strong>. But to be <strong>more efficient</strong>, you can charge your battery by doing <strong>aerial tricks</strong> and use it to display &quot;hologram&quot; such as a <strong>bumper</strong> that return 5x the force of the collision to an opponent, or a <strong>jumper</strong> that allow your teammates to go on the other side of the convoy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1019840/extras/01179853fb99cf934e1c8a9dad8b5f75.avif?t=1549101718\" width=640 height=250 /></span></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About The Midnight Team</h2><br><strong>The Midnight Team</strong> is a young game studio composed by… only <strong>one person</strong>!
