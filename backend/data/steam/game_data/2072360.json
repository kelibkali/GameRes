You are an innovative restaurateur in a fantastical world. But to supply your kitchen, you must explore dangerous dungeons and conquer delicious enemies to acquire the ingredients needed for your culinary masterpieces! <br><br>Surviving in a fantasy world is hard.  (No 24 hour groceries or food delivery services.) You have your own cozy restaurant and homestead. But that’s not enough to satisfy the adventurous tastes of your customers and yourself.  You need fresh, exciting ingredients to use in your dishes, and the fastest, cheapest way to get them is by going dungeon-diving. <br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2072360/extras/d196d1c79eaebf5a2899312bf8e4b44d.poster.avif?t=1728035033\" width=620 height=178 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2072360/extras/d196d1c79eaebf5a2899312bf8e4b44d.webm?t=1728035033\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><strong>The Dungeon:</strong> <br>Explore the woods!
