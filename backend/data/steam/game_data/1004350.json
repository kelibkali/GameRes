    "description": "<strong>Area Cooperation Economic Simulation: North Korea (ACES)</strong> simulates the development of North Korea's Pyongyang economy. This is an economic development simulation and not a game. Useful for an economics class.<br><br>You make investments in infrastructure, security, education, workforce, food, production, or trade to grow the economy, and set tax rates. Bad weather, corruption or international grants will affect your policies. Citizens will be unhappy if your economic policies fail and will increase crime and instability of economy.  Each ACES turn is one year and goes on for ten year period. At the end of each year key performance indicators and news reports are shown (After Action Report). At the end of ten years a graph shows ten-tear performance and your performance is evaluated (After Action Report).<br><br>Diplomatic relations are improving with North Korea, South Korea and USA. North Korean Chairman Kim Jong-un said in his New Year 2019 speech economic development is the highest priority. <br><br>ACES is a teaching tool to train officials to assist North Korea development. ACES is based on accepted theories and models of international economic development and regional development. ACES includes problem variables such as urbanization and corruption common in developing nations. Other problem variables unique to North Korea are included: bad weather. <br><br>In ACES, theories, models and key performance indicators are explained for students. <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1004350/extras/6d1bff63c5a8090804fa4b6a24dd9e52.avif?t=1704479557\" width=466 height=180 /></span>",
