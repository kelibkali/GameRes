He’s given you an ultimatum. Surrender your castle or be throne out. (See what I did there? Because the king sits on a throne. . .yeah? . . . never mind.) With an army of misfits at his beck and call, you’d better pick up that bow and arrow and settle in for some crown duels. <br><br>Castle Invasion is the fun, frantic challenge of defending your castle against an army. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/504850/extras/cbae144ebaab770a696b597838b03285.avif?t=1469610470\" width=630 height=167 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 50 frantic, action packed levels. <br></li><li> 5 deadly bosses. <br></li><li> Use coins dropped by enemies to buy over 40 weapon upgrades.<br></li><li> Wizards, jesters, knights, dwarves, executioners and more in an army of medieval misfits. <br></li><li> Full to bursting with awful, awful puns.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/504850/extras/747a83b4983cb32df9cc42b4b4cc5280.avif?t=1469610470\" width=630 height=167 /></span><br><br>Upgrade, equip and fire your way through an onslaught of attackers with state of the art weapons such as the bow and arrow or the spear.
