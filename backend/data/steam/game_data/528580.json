Built in less than a month, this departure from traditional gameplay delivers the feels we’ve been dreaming of since VR landed. <br />\r\n <br />\r\nEnter Found, and you just might lose yourself…<br />\r\n <br />\r\nPlease comment or send any initial feedback as we plan to polish. Stay tuned for updates! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe would like to thank our incredible team below that made this all possible!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCREDITS<br />\r\nCreative Director: Priyam Parikh<br />\r\nTechnical Director: Andrew Moran<br />\r\nAnimator &amp; CG Artist: Jake Stull<br />\r\nProducer: Jewel Lim<br />\r\nComposer: Niko Korolog<br />\r\nDigital Strategist: Aaron Bales",
