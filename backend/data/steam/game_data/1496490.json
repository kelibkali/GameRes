    "description": "A few years ago there was a major infection, then a vaccine was developed against it and the world felt safe.<br />\r\nBut then a new, much worse epidemic broke out, it is not certain whether the new epidemic was caused by the vaccine or by the people who did not get vaccinated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this work adventure you start on an old industrial site with a gun in your hand. You have to kill mutated humans and fight your way to the end of the level. It's best to hit the zombies in their head, then they'll die faster.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you don't survive, your game progress will be preserved, but you have to start again from the starting point, so try not to let mutated humans live.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to rumors, an old transport ship is lying at the hemp, try to find it and go to the gate. If you are alone, just go in. If you are playing with several players, they all have to go into the gate, nobody is allowed to go back.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut be aware that the path through the container city is supposed to be like a labyrinth. And some survivors have reported gigantic fire-throwing zombies.",
