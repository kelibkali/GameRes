    "description": "You step off the chopper and into the sweltering heat of the jungle, grab your gear, and head off in search of fame, fortune, and prehistoric beasts. Nobody knows exactly why dinosaurs have shown up on this remote jungle island, but you know you can take them out. You've been hired as a mercenary to kill as many of these things as possible, and the good news is the checks have all cleared. <br><br>Island 359 is a Virtual Reality survival game for the HTC Vive and Oculus Touch. Players will scrounge for weapons, upgrades, food, and other items they can find to survive for as long as they can against hordes of dinosaurs, as they explore the increasingly dangerous, beautiful, and expansive island. You're a mercenary, the money's no good to you if you're dead, so you're going to need to survive long enough to get out if you want bragging rights and a fat bank account.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/476700/extras/98083df8857526a2941abb85b645a5d0.webp?t=1626902447\" width=363 height=39 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Accessibility Modes (Reach Assist, Bump Turns, Seated Mode)<br></li><li>All New Survival Mode<br></li><li>Virtual Reality Shooter<br></li><li>Mercenary and Arcade Modes<br></li><li>Global Leaderboards<br></li><li>See Your Entire Body in VR with Virtual Self<br></li><li>Multiple Player Movement Systems (Sprint, Teleport, Trackpad)<br></li><li>Mercenary Store<br></li><li>Realistic Weapons<br></li><li>Throwable Melee Items and Explosives<br></li><li>Upgradable Weapons and Character Stats<br></li><li>Intelligent Dinosaurs<br></li><li>Incredible Jungle Island Presence<br></li><li>Chopper Rides<br></li><li>Climbable Ladders</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/476700/extras/dc1fdb704d3f64b81a60cbbc160ade87.webp?t=1626902447\" width=363 height=39 /></span><br><br>Now Featuring our all new Survival Mode.
