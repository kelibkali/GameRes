    "description": "<strong>The Land of Glass</strong> is a card game with a twist: speed. It's CCG meets action RPG, combining card collecting and deck building with frantic combat. Choose your heroes, build your deck, and save Vitrerran.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A Real-Time Card Game</h2><br><strong>The Land of Glass</strong> is a new kind of card game, one where combat doesn't go back and forth in precise turns but operates in real time. The strategy and synergy of typical CCGs is present; however, you'll need more than that to succeed. The monsters won't wait for you to choose your best cards.<br><br>Combat takes place over two ever-changing grids: attack and defense. Punish your foes with big, heavy blows or swift strikes while countering with a steady stream of defense cards. Use magic to infuse your attacks with fire, ice, explosions, and more; lay traps; burn away defenses; and slow your opponents down for some needed breathing room.<br><br>Magic is not confined to simply attacking and defending, though. Alter the playing field itself with massive spells, from fields of fire to lightning storms to man-eating plants. There are nine different types of magic to find, and experimenting is key to survival.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A Character-Driven Story</h2><br>A knight is sent on a quest he cannot complete. A misfit believes he has ended the world. A mage searches for answers. A blacksmith demands revenge. <br><br>The portals were supposed to make Vitrerran a better place. They were supposed to save the continent, to unite a divided people. Instead, they brought ruin. Instead, they brought monsters.<br><br><strong>The Land of Glass</strong> is an RPG with eight protagonists spanning four campaigns. Each character is forced to explore the world for the first time, to confront his biases and misconceptions as he tries to stop a magical plague that threatens to eat the continent. While set against an apocalyptic backdrop, <strong>The Land of Glass</strong> tells stories that are both personal and small—it is a character study first and an epic fantasy second.<br><br>Because not every quest is noble, and not every world is worth saving.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>    Four campaigns with eight different characters<br></li><li>    A unique take on deck-based card games<br></li><li>    Character driven story<br></li><li>    Nine different types of magic<br></li><li>    Hundreds of cards to collect<br></li><li>    In-depth crafting system<br></li><li>    Stained glass art style</li></ul>",
