    "description": "Use your Dischord to reflect your opponent's attacks back at them in this epic battle of the bards!  Pluck three notes to cast a chord, match 2 out of 3 notes of an incoming chord to counter it.  Play VR or on a keyboard against an AI opponent of increasing difficulty.  Or play with a friend in Asymmetric mode with one player in VR and one at a keyboard.  Prefer a more casual experience?  Hang out in the Free Jam area and play a variety of magical musical instruments to your heart's content.",
