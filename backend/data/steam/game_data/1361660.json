    "description": "Among distant stars a lone Robot Knight must stand against an ancient and unfathomable evil. Explore the vast and alien Degathalion space station and battle the nefarious Xetanoids in a daring quest to confront their rulers and save the Centaurus galaxy.  Aetagradion, an immortal alien cyborg and leader of the Xetanoids has enslaved the galaxy and stolen the sacred Protos Orb technology to bend it to his horrid will. With no one to stand in the Xetanoids way the fate of Centaurus looks bleak. Yet from cosmic origins a hero has arrived. You must fight your way through the Degathalion and recover the lost Protos Orbs; Confront Aetagradion and put an end to his reign of terror.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the mission to defeat the Xetanoids, you play as Alas, a heroic and sentient robot. He is an intergalactic lawman of celestial might, tasked with bringing justice to the cosmos. And he has not come unprepared for a fight! Armed with a righteous power sword, trusty force shield and plasma side-arm, you must mete out retribution on the Xetanoids. Yet the Degathalion is a deadly domain of pitfalls and unexpected dangers which Alas must blast through on the wings of his fusion powered Jetpack. As you explore and recover the lost Protos Orbs, Alas's power will grow and a greater array of advanced weaponry will become available. Nuke the Xetanoids with the mega plasma cannon, or cleave them to pieces with the mighty power axe,  while zooming through the dark twisting tunnels of the Degathalion. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlas Astra is a cosmic adventure that spans the galactic history of the Xetanoids, the tragic tales of the Centaurus galaxy's free beings; glimpses the starry origins of robotic consciousness and even the faint glimmers of creation itself.  It is a Science Fiction epic with cyber-technology and astrophysics at it's steel studded core. Will you brave the dark depths of the Degathalion, uncover it's alien mysteries, and in the triumph of good over evil, shape the fate of the future?",
