    "description": "<strong>Note: This is the exact same simulation of the A-10A as featured in DCS: Flaming Cliffs 3.</strong><br><br>The A-10A Thunderbolt II, also known as the Warthog, is a 'flying gun'. The aircraft was used extensively during Operation Desert Storm, in support of NATO operations in response to the Kosovo crisis, in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The A-10A is a high-survivability and versatile aircraft, popular with pilots for the 'get home' effectiveness. The mission of the aircraft is ground attack against tanks, armored vehicles and installations, and close air support of ground forces. The Warthog is famous for its massive 30mm cannon, but it can also be armed with Maverick guided missiles and several types of bombs and rockets.<br><br>The A-10A is the forerunner of the A-10C and has much in common with the A-10C. Although the A-10A lacks the glass cockpit some of sensors and weapons of the A-10C, it is more simple aircraft to operate. <br><br>A-10A for DCS World focuses on ease of use without complicated cockpit interaction, significantly reducing the learning curve. As such, A-10A features keyboard and joystick cockpit commands with a focus on the most mission critical of cockpit systems.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Detailed and accurate 3D model and animations<br></li><li>Six Degrees of Freedom (6DOF) capable cockpit<br></li><li>Advanced Flight Model (AFM)<br></li><li>Campaign and missions<br></li><li>A-10A skins from a wide array of squadrons<br></li><li>Both Simulation and Game modes</li></ul>",
