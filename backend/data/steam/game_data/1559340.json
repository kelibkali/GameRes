    "description": "Qubie is a Community driven platformer about a rectangular alien (Qubie) who is on a mission to take over the galaxy one world at a time. Defeat the various &quot;Squares&quot; and collect all the coins to clear levels and progress. Keep an eye out for special enemy characters. These special enemies are twitch streamers who have helped me and continue to help me throughout the development process. All music that is featured in qubie are original works by myself or my development team, so you can stream Qubie without fear of copyright infringement. We at CodeBreaker Studios encourage community input so please, if you have an idea, share it In the community discussion and we will do our best to implement it.",
