So many tricks–he can stick to walls and run on the ceiling. He shoots kunai instead of bullets that he (or his opponents!) can retrieve and re-fire. He can tilt the kunai in unpredictable directions. He’s kind of slow, but he has a fast-fall mixup to catch opponents off-guard. Try him once you’ve mastered the basics.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong><i>REGULAR UPDATES</i></strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > See the Roadmap above for the full list of updates: completed, in progress, and planned.</p>",
