The only thing the three characters have in common is the first person view, which fully immerses the player in every character’s life.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >THEMES</h2>The Way of Life DEFINITIVE EDITION tells stories about several serious themes: from euthanasia to the death penalty, from war to love, from bullying to discrimination. Every one of them is tied to the other by the game’s main themes: personal growth and the different ways of perceiving reality.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/404960/extras/e45bfaef6009af085ca847635837e6f8.poster.avif?t=1560770171\" width=600 height=110 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/404960/extras/e45bfaef6009af085ca847635837e6f8.webm?t=1560770171\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/404960/extras/e45bfaef6009af085ca847635837e6f8.mp4?t=1560770171\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >CHARACTERS</h2>The player chooses how to face every experience, so every playthrough can be different depending on what decisions the player takes. The characters are extremely different, both visually and control related. The child sees the world in vibrant colors, eager to explore it, while the adult has a narrower, desaturated view except for the things he really cares about. Control wise, the old man moves slowly, with a shaking camera, to simulate how an elderly person moves; while the child can run and jump freely.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/404960/extras/225592b2784375d8099410f009f9d9e9.poster.avif?t=1560770171\" width=128 height=128 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/404960/extras/225592b2784375d8099410f009f9d9e9.webm?t=1560770171\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/404960/extras/225592b2784375d8099410f009f9d9e9.mp4?t=1560770171\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/404960/extras/d1ceee0ee028292af4a273b04c30a963.webp?t=1560770171\" width=108 height=1 /></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/404960/extras/d85dd51bb014debba87118c5b84fa839.poster.avif?t=1560770171\" width=128 height=128 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/404960/extras/d85dd51bb014debba87118c5b84fa839.webm?t=1560770171\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/404960/extras/d85dd51bb014debba87118c5b84fa839.mp4?t=1560770171\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/404960/extras/d1ceee0ee028292af4a273b04c30a963.webp?t=1560770171\" width=108 height=1 /></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/404960/extras/688bd72f3a346b11698749cb50078beb.poster.avif?t=1560770171\" width=128 height=128 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/404960/extras/688bd72f3a346b11698749cb50078beb.webm?t=1560770171\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/404960/extras/688bd72f3a346b11698749cb50078beb.mp4?t=1560770171\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >CONTENT</h2>The Way of Life DEFINITIVE EDITION will feature 10 Experiences, 30 Levels and more than 70 Significant Choices.
