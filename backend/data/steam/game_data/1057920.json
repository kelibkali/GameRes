    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >D&amp;D Classics: Monstrous Manual (2E)</h2>Need a monster? Look inside, where more than 300 new peices of full color art show what the monsters really look like!<br><strong><br>This book contains more than 600 monsters including all the creatures from the MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM Volumes 1 and 2! In addition, there are monsters from the other MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM Volumes, and some creatures never seen in the second edition of the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game before.<br><i> We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today. Some older content may reflect ethnic, racial, and gender prejudice that were commonplace in American society at that time. These depictions were wrong then and are wrong today. This content is presented as it was originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed. Dungeons &amp; Dragons teaches that diversity is a strength, and we strive to make our D&amp;D products as welcoming and inclusive as possible. This part of our work will never end.</i></strong><br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Mike Wilson</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the D&amp;D Classics - AD&amp;D 1E/2E ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
