    "description": "Era of Combat: Boxing is a multiplayer VR experience that strives to reward physical and martial prowess. Grab a friend, or a complete stranger, and face-off for a heart-pumping, head-thumping good time! <br><br>Make 'em sweat! <br><br>************************************************************<br>READ BEFORE YOU PURCHASE EARLY ACCESS<br>************************************************************<br>Warning: This game is focused on the PvP multiplayer experience only. Solo play is in alpha and NOT currently recommended. PLEASE read through our materials in the discussions including &quot;What to Expect From Early Access&quot;. You can also watch our casual walk-through on YouTube (and above) with the Dev and remember that this is an EARLY ACCESS game. If you are interested in getting in early and helping with feedback about a multiplayer VR boxing game then this is for you! Join our Discord and make sure you have some friends to play with because finding unscheduled PvP matches is still sporadic as our player base grows.<br><br>BE AWARE BEFORE BUYING:<br><br>- NO THUMBSTICK CONTROLS - this is intentional. Use your body to move around your space, to dodge, weave, etc.<br><br>- THE SINGLE PLAYER MODE IS UNDERDEVELOPED - we've focused almost ENTIRELY on PvP thus far. So please don't buy this game in Early Access if you just want to test yourself against the AI/Bots - you WILL be disappointed. Bot polishing is ongoing but secondary to the PvP experience.<br><br>- MULTIPLAYER WORKS WELL AND IS NEARING COMPLETION - but finding random players is unlikely at this point. Bring in friends to play with / join a community of fighters online, or it's unlikely you'll find PvP matches yet. A match scheduling system is now available, and crossplay is coming soon.<br><br>Finally, if you are purchasing this because you expect the feel of a boxing game that has many YEARS in development then please PASS for now. This game is less than EIGHTEEN MONTHS through development (with one dev). If you're joining us for Early Access, expect ROUGH, but please don't hold that against us in your reviews at this point - we have gone to great lengths to warn you. We're building this game because we love boxing and PvP, and we are learning as we go. <br><br>*NOTE that a dedicated Oculus/Meta/Quest2 version is now available in AppLab. Search &quot;Era of Combat Boxing&quot; or see our Discord for a link. Crossplay features between AppLab and this Steam version are also now available. <br>************************************************************<br><br>Use the solo training exercises, take on the AI, or jump right into what EOC Boxing was designed to do and challenge your friends to three different match types including exhibition, amateur or professional ranked fights where your reputation, stats, virtual cash, and boxer’s title is on the line. <br><br>EOC is a physically demanding game that will push you to improve your cardio and your core. But you'll need some space to add this energetic workout to your routine. Make sure you have at least 1.5m by 2m of unobstructed space to swing and then tell your family members to stand back - WAY back. Or better yet, pick up another headset and challenge them to a no-impact, no-holds-barred grudge match to prove your unconditional supremacy! (separate VR rooms <strong>highly </strong> recommended)<br><br>We want to stress once more that EOC is currently <strong>Early Access</strong> and we are looking for <strong>your </strong> feedback, so if you love boxing and don't mind giving us a glove (er hand), we're all ears about how we can make this game the best that it can possibly be. <br><br>What’s coming up in the very near future? We’re glad you asked! Greater player customization, multiple avatars of gender and race, server moderated multiplayer cash, careers, and titles. A large expansion of the single player mode (we started with multiplayer in mind and need some AI polish during Early Access to give you the solo challenge you deserve). We'll be launching a number of AI opponents to make you sweat on your way to the top in upcoming free content upgrades as we move toward completing our Early Access roadmap. You’ll progress through different venues and earn your place in the hall of champions. <br><br>EOC Boxing was designed from the ground up to support multiplayer VR and we want to ensure that EOC strives for realism while striking the balance in playability. We trust that Early Access already offers players a stable and challenging multiplayer experience that is above all else, entertaining.",
