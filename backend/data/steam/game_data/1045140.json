    "description": "ESKO assigns the player the role of an intern who is tasked with fixing the computer’s processor and writing code for the machine to read. These tasks are simplified in a manner that is enjoyable for all ages. The gameplay environment was modeled in co-operation with the Museum of Technology to match 1960’s Finland as closely as possible. All of the models were made by in-house graphical artists and reviewed for authenticity by the museums’ history professionals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers are tasked to fix ESKO’s central processor by changing broken electron tubes, writing code on a punched tape and inserting it into a code reader. If the code is written successfully, a miniature cannon will fire upon one of the three targets. The ESKO game incorporates a simplified version of the actual programming, where the players have to pull a lever and play a mini game instead of actually punching holes in a sheet of paper. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe development of ESKO is part of Stories to games project, which is coordinated by the Finnish Museum Association and funded by European Social Fund..",
