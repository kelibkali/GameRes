    "description": "Enter the world of Cirque du Soleil for an up close and intimate look at their most provocative shows. Swing into a dreamlike realm in ‘Through the Masks of LUZIA’, where light quenches the spirit and rain soothes the soul. Dive into a hypnotic underwater universe in ‘DREAMS OF ‘O’’ where you are submerged into a universe full of daring dives, aerial stunts, and surreal amphibious characters. Challenge your visual perceptions and conceptions in ‘Inside the Box of KURIOS,’ as you find yourself in the midst of a fantastical world of acrobats, jugglers and steampunk mechanisms. Watch a battle unfold in the mythical world of ‘KÀ: The Battle Within,’ where two rival clans confront each other in a furious clash of vertiginous acrobatics and breathtaking combat. Cirque du Soleil VR blurs the line between stage and audience, bringing these fantastical experiences to life as you’ve never seen before.",
