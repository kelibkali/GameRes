    "description": "During the 1960s the newly independent Congo was the scene of constant warfare. Congo Merc puts you in the middle of that fighting with a task force of elite commandos. You conduct breakneck advances into the heart of enemy territory, seize critical objectives and, just as important, return to home base.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBased on the board game by Decision Games, Congo Merc includes everything from hostage rescue to tracking down Cuban cadre. You recruit from a variety of unit types, including jeep-mounted commandos, light armor, sappers, air support, paratroopers and many others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce a task force is organized, you maneuver it into the Congo. The map covers the entire country, and when a force enters certain points an event occurs. Events can include anything from UN intervention to ambushes by enemy fighters. Combat is resolved via a quasi-tactical procedure in which both tactical superiority and firepower play their parts.",
