All that viewers have to do is type !play and they'll be entered into the lobby!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay loop</h2>Once the streamer decides that there are enough players in the lobby, they will start the game. <br>Players are then placed into random positions in the maze, and will automatically start navigating. No further interaction is required from the viewers end!<br><br>This is not a game you will play for hours on end, but it is sure to deliver a lovely distraction for anyone who is watching your livestream. <br>Live Maze can also function as a raffle system! Have the first person to reach the center of the maze win something, or host a grand-prix.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Find randomly placed weapons and fight off other players<br></li><li> Find bombs and other power ups!<br></li><li> Start rounds manually or have mods do it when you're AFK<br></li><li> Each maze will be procedurally generated, with the size based on the amount of players in the lobby<br></li><li> Lots of customisation options for the streamer to create a unique experience every round</li></ul>",
