    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > <i> Tropical Islands (Map Pack)</i> </h2>It’s important for me as a GM that my gamers encounter varied areas and islands when they are sailing across the high seas, searching for treasures or revealing hidden secrets. If you are also among those who like to make these visible on your tabletop, then you know that sometimes it’s simply hard to find the right map if you need a small island, a coast or a group of islands; and it also isn’t worth it (neither in time nor money) to seek out or create a new one every single time your players want a small-time raid. You can sketch them up anytime, but if you are not an artist or you need a more spectacular solution, well, you had to go for a map. Until now...<br>This set includes:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>1 sunlit map </li><li>1 night map </li><li>28 sunlit mini-maps </li><li>28 night mini-maps </li><li>Works with any ruleset! </li></ul><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Antal Keninger</strong><br><i> Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i>  AAW Games[/b]<br><strong> Requires:</strong>  The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and any ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
