These people have needs too. Basically, the mechanics of the game are about growing the kingdom and meeting the necessary needs with it.<br><br>For example, fish should be consumed as food. Employees are needed to operate the Fisherman building, which provides this. Just like the automation buildings in Factorio need energy and this is provided by coal consumption, in this game, the buildings need employees, and these employees also need food, etc. <br>consumption must be ensured<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >NEEDS</h2>The people's shelter in the kingdom and the structure of the building Let's look at the House building. There are two kinds of needs as resources and buildings. <br>Keeping the resource requirement constantly Needs such as Fish, Cheese. These needs change their boundaries. For example, in a kingdom with 50+ population, there is a need for Bread. <br><br>Buildings solve these needs according to their own spheres of influence.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >PRODUCTION</h2>Resource production is limited and infinitely diversified. Limited resources such as trees are found in a certain number on a tile. These resources are collected manually by tapping on the tile, or automatically by the building that collects the relevant resource. <br><br>Cheese and Dairy Farm are examples of those who produce unlimited resources. This building first produces Cheese and then carries the source it produces.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2001720/extras/9df146769d4059c177882856d2ddfc8d.poster.avif?t=1753623822\" width=600 height=124 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2001720/extras/9df146769d4059c177882856d2ddfc8d.webm?t=1753623822\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2001720/extras/9df146769d4059c177882856d2ddfc8d.mp4?t=1753623822\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >PRODUCTION CHAIN</h2>Some resources are used as raw materials. For example, Bread production is provided by the Bakery building. Flour is required to produce bread. This is provided by Mill. Wheat is required to produce Flour, which is provided by Farm. <br><br>Production can be achieved by arranging these buildings correctly. If the distance between buildings increases, production slows down. In addition, the production rate varies according to the number of workers inside the buildings.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >RESEARCH &amp; TECH TREE</h2>Research and Tech Tree mechanics were heavily  influenced by Factorio. First of all, an item from the Tech Tree should be selected for the research. The research task is done by the Academy building. You can think of it like the Lab building in Factorio. The source for research is books.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2001720/extras/0652bc9d1064d6515c001e1f83190cd9.poster.avif?t=1753623822\" width=624 height=346 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2001720/extras/0652bc9d1064d6515c001e1f83190cd9.webm?t=1753623822\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2001720/extras/0652bc9d1064d6515c001e1f83190cd9.mp4?t=1753623822\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
