    "description": "“HELLO PUPPETS!” is a horror-comedy adventure that turns your hand into a living, talking puppet named Scout. Years ago, a bad Sesame Street knock-off called “Mortimer’s Handeemen” was canceled and forgotten, but the puppets from the show have come to life, they’re pure evil, and they have plans for you. Your only chance of escape is the somewhat-less-evil Scout. Work with Scout to escape the evil Handeemen puppets before it’s too late!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1426280/extras/4ad4f25f1b8f443585e92dea8d3f3e6c.avif?t=1658766989\" width=500 height=265 /></span><br><br>In 1986, a fire destroyed the studio where “Mortimer’s Handeemen,” a failing children’s show starring hand puppets, was filmed. Eight people died, including the show’s creator. Ever since, rumors have swirled that the burnt-out shell of a warehouse was haunted. You play as a college reporter who broke in to see if the rumors were true. You’re about to get more than you bargained for. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1426280/extras/70568d6014cfbbcc040b5cfcc747a811.poster.avif?t=1658766989\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1426280/extras/70568d6014cfbbcc040b5cfcc747a811.webm?t=1658766989\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1426280/extras/70568d6014cfbbcc040b5cfcc747a811.mp4?t=1658766989\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>“Hello Puppets!” is an immersive VR horror game with a twist: stuck on one of your hands is a sarcastic, foul-mouthed sentient puppet named Scout. Scout isn’t your usual companion character: she doesn’t like you and you don’t like her, but you’ll have to work together to escape the evil cast of “Mortimer’s Handeemen,” brought to life by a magical spell gone wrong. You’re on the run from psychotic puppets, and your only friend is a puppet who is, by her own account, “slightly less evil.” <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1426280/extras/10b516a59c8d970e6abda0ce78136477.poster.avif?t=1658766989\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1426280/extras/10b516a59c8d970e6abda0ce78136477.webm?t=1658766989\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1426280/extras/10b516a59c8d970e6abda0ce78136477.mp4?t=1658766989\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Unique horror-meets-comedy tone.
