Since it is a bullet hell game in a endless scenario, just torn everything down while trying your best to survive to get the highest score. Longer survival will increase enemy spawn rate and consequently the difficulty. Hard and insane mode awards more score points per kill, but will have a lot more enemies spawning.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/757700/extras/c0eb9bd3c17cfe821c6440ebfbadfce8.webp?t=1515639725\" width=616 height=32 /></span><br>The controls are pretty simple for most characters:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> AWSD: Movement <br></li><li>Left shift: Special (a powerful spell).<br></li><li>Space: Look further.<br></li><li>E: for most other classes specialties (priest blessing, for instance)<br></li><li>The engineer is a special case since it uses the right mouse button and left control to spawn a damage buff and attack speed buff respectively.</li></ul><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/757700/extras/8ac8b0ef809ffeff8a8281aa59529eb1.webp?t=1515639725\" width=616 height=32 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Engaging fast-paced combat!<br></li><li>Simple, eye-catching low poly action!<br></li><li>Two normal difficulty levels and the Insane mode for the most daring of players!<br></li><li>6 Different classes with varying gameplay!<br></li><li>Challeging pastime while queueing for other games!<br></li><li>Op characters with lots of RNG involved!<br></li><li>Op characters with low RNG!<br></li><li>Leaderboards</li></ul><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/757700/extras/b8cb4df9cf2bea9a784eff11cf975999.webp?t=1515639725\" width=616 height=32 /></span><br>Expect Dungeon's Barrage to basically be a replayable pastime for long queue games or try to enter the top 5 of the leaderboard or to just kill things with your favorite class after a long day at work.
