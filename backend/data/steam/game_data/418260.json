    "description": "Based on the classic arcade racing style and console kart racers, this Fast Paced racer brings you into the track in virtual reality. With both utility and sport vehicles, Gumball Drift takes you on a tour of the world. Racing both on and off road, gain powerful pickups and added awards while you hold the lead and leave your opponents in the dust!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGumball Rally is an arcade racer that takes you back to the fast paced action of top down cart racing, now in virtual realty! Take to the track with a God like perspective, with complete control of your racing vehicle with a joystick controller. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAvoid contact with the other racers to keep your car in one piece, or else you might find yourself in a fiery wreck. Use helpful power ups found around the track, like car repair packs, protective force fields, and even speed boosting nitro. But watch out, your opponents can use those pickups as well, and might fight you for them. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRace either by yourself against some competitive AI, or with friends via online multiplayer in a virtual reality race room, where you can talk smack and watch the other drivers in a remote racing league. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor those brave enough to join the battle with the Oculus Rift or at Room Scale with the HTC Vive, a VR version of the game will put you directly in the race as you experience remote miniature car racing. Complete VR immersion can be experienced with in-game VR menus, HUDS, stats, controls and gauges.",
