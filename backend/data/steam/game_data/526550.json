    "description": "On a road trip for Halloween, your car breaks down on the side of the road.  A strange set of circumstances follows, as a young child appears screaming for your help and then disappears into the corn fields.  Now that you've been stranded here in the middle of nowhere, you must wander into the cornfields to save this child - whoever she is. You will encounter many challenges along the way that may surprise and frighten you. This game is specifically built for VR and contains realistic graphics that will immerse you in the environment. Pitchfork is both terrifying and enjoyable, with a story line that will keep you guessing.",
