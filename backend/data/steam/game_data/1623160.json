    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >   D&amp;D Classics - MC15 Monstrous Compendium Ravenloft Appendix II: Children of the Night (2E)</h2>The moon is full. The mists have risen. The terror is upon you. Step into these swirling clouds of fog, and you will come face to face with creatures more terrible than you can imagine. Be careful, for those who are embraced by the mists seldom live to tell the tale. Children of the Night presents complete descriptions of 20 unique individuals for use in the RAVENLOFT campaign setting, Ideal for use as important NPC or major villains, these creatures are certain to linger in the nightmares of player characters for year to come.<br><i> <strong>   We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today.
