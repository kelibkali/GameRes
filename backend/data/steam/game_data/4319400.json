    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This soundtrack is the result of a collaborative effort by many composers over quite a long stretch of time. Long enough that we aren't even sure who exactly wrote some of these tracks!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >I won't even attempt to define the genre of all this chaos, nor will I try to master it – this time capsule must remain untouched.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Some tracks were written specifically for the game, while others came from completely different projects. There is even one that was a composer’s actual treatment for insomnia! Yes, we clearly lacked skill, and to some, it might sound like we just rolled our faces across a MIDI keyboard, but we genuinely tried to convey the atmosphere.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Development took place back in the distant 2015 – during the heyday of <i>doujin culture</i>, so to speak. We tried to emulate that specific Yume Nikki mood, where texture prevails over rhythm and tonality.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >So, I invite you on this excursion to a &quot;pseudo-2007&quot; that is actually 2015.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Composers: Penguinum, Firiat, dsp2003, Okamisen, Mr. RK, Nekomata</p>",
