    "description": "ACROSS is a roomscale VR game, where you are tasked with a simple objective : cross the room.<br><br>Each level has a start portal, an end portal, ... and things in between. <br>You can count on two things to help you defeat each level : a glowing katana that cuts through everything and reflect projectiles, and a furry B.E.A.R. that you must protect at all costs.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 25 levels - about 1 hour of playtime.<br></li><li> Change the color of your weapon at will.<br></li><li> Not a wave shooter : ACROSS makes you think and observe before acting (well, except for that one level).<br></li><li> Roomscale VR : Makes full use of the HTC vive capabilities. ACROSS is played standing, and without pressing any button.</li></ul>",
