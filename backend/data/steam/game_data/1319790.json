    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Do you have what it takes to make the ultimate yogurt commercial of all time?</h2> Are you willing to travel to the ends of the earth and beyond? Do you know how to kill a ghost or vanquish a vampire? Can you find creative uses for household chemicals, power tools, and ancient tomes of magic? Will you stop at nothing to realize your goals, not even great personal risk, or murder? Being an actor in a yogurt commercial will test you in all these ways, and more.<br><br><br>Yogurt Commercial 3 is a sandbox puzzle adventure game. As the new star actor in town, it is your job to collect the items and abilities you need in order to film commercials of increasing complexity. The client (Bob Yogurt™) is tough to please, and they know no boundaries in the search for the Ultimate Yogurt Commercial of All Time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Redefine the nature of the yogurt advertisement industry</h2>A yogurt commercial might go off the rails. Whether you are attacked by a gang of greasers, assault a clown, poison your co-star, or set off a vomit chain reaction, the focus group will dutifully react to whatever you have captured on tape, providing honest reviews and constructive criticism. Will your commercials push the boundaries of taste and decency? Will the lawyer need to get involved? What <i>will</i> it take to please the client?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Enlarge your power</h2>Craft potions, collect tools, choose your perks, and learn the tactics required to walk through an active volcano or survive in a vacuum, like yogurt commercial actors are frequently required to do. Knowledge is power, like the knowledge of how to make a flamethrower out of a squirt gun and household chemicals!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The most accurate yogurt commercial simulation since Yogurt Commercial 2</h2>Characters dynamically react to your in-game actions, by putting out fires, fleeing from danger, greeting strangers, delivering pizza, fighting back with weaponry, vomiting uncontrollably, flying into a mob of violence, while reacting to each other and creating emergent chaos. Your own character will react to and remember the occurrences they witness.<br><br>Hurl procedurally generated insults and threats in order to provoke those foolish enough to stand in your way, or assume control of any other character in the game to take their abilities and collect their items!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Explore the limits of space and time</h2>Your quest covers a large game world full of puzzles to solve, items to collect, characters to meet, and potions to craft. Travel deep beneath the Earth's surface, to distant worlds, and maybe even open an ancient forbidden gate to the underworld in order to shoot on location.",
