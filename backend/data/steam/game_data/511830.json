    "description": "Go on a journey through vast, ornately decorated halls into deep, dark caverns full of glittering treasures and gaze upon wide open vistas of unparalleled beauty in stunning virtual reality... Is how the description of a pretty little VR experience game might start. <br><strong>However</strong>, this is a game about paintball guns and shooting waves upon waves of robots, a dash of story is thrown into the mix and I hope you like it! But remember it’s mainly just inane senseless robot murder, target shooting and leader boards.<br><br>Created for VR using HTC Vive and Unreal Engine 4 <br><br>VR Ultimate Paintball: Heartbreak, Regret &amp; Paintbots focuses on an arcade like style of gameplay.
