    "description": "Are you fed up with arcade strategies with units fighting in almost hand to hand distances? <br>Bored with slow-paced simulators with UI that could be used as torture tool?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Steel Rain</strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Why?</h2>We are accustomed to the idea that realistic war games almost always lack in graphics, audio, UI department and need lot of time to play.<br>But they don't have to. They shouldn't….. and that's why Steel Rain idea was born. <br>We believe that's because war game developers usually aren't players and lack passion for their products.<br>Time to prove that you don’t need to choose between fun or realism!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Who?</h2>Founded and designed with passion by long time war games player raised on classic series like Steel Panthers, Sudden Strike, Blitzkrieg, Combat Mission, Soldiers: Heroes of World War II, Company of Heroes etc. who believe that the best WWII themed game has yet to come :)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >How?</h2>Thanks to vast experience and passion with war games we could take the best from both worlds: casual strategies and realistic war games, without neglecting audio and UI departments that we believe are as important as good visuals for truly immersive and fun wargame experience.<br>Not less important is also community engagement with game and it's development.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What?</h2>Steel Rain is designed at the very foundation with modding support and multiplayer game modes.
