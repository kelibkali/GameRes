Check it out!<br />\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-S7nP-ojqo&amp;list=PLjQh_Yi8CoBzW3k1QavOOaseD7XeN_xK_<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEver wanted to learn vector calculus? <br />\r\nSee some crazy parametrized functions? <br />\r\nDid newton invent or discover calculus? Are we living in a simulation? <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese are all questions this VR experience may be able to answer. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCalcflow is here. Open your mind to mathematics. <br />\r\nExplore the secrets to the universe. <br />\r\nEverything starts with the math. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCalcflow features intuitive ways you can learn the foundations of vector calculus. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can finally explain the complexities of vector calculus to your friend! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nManipulate vectors with your hands, explore vector addition and cross product. <br />\r\nSee and feel a double integral of a sinusoidal graph in 3D, a mobius strip and it's normal, and spherical coordinates! <br />\r\nCreate your own parametrized function and vector field! Don't worry, if these mean like crazy mumbo jumbo, you can always explore some of our awesome presets and sample problems! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can also create your own notes while you're exploring these amazing mathematical properties! Simply push the track pad and write away in 2D or 3D!",
