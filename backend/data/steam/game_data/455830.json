Every Thursday night at an old local theater you could come see the wonderful and amazing; the bizarre and obscure. However, this all went awry one night when a cloaked warlock came to see the show. During the final act, the warlock, known as Xonolox, performed an evil spell that was meant to steal the eyes of the entire audience. But the spell was too powerful, he couldn't control it! It backfired, ripped through space and time,  and created a multi-layered universe that left the performers of the FrightShow taking the side of good or evil.<br><br>Now trapped in the FrightVerse, where anything is possible, these FrightShow Fighters must do battle in hopes of finding a way out, and back to the normalcy they once knew.  The fighters must do all they can to defeat whomever chooses to go into battle against them.  Now YOU must prepare for FrightShow Fighter!",
