I currently live with my wife, two cats, and one dog. <br>This is my second game so far.  I’m a life-long gamer, (growing up with two brothers, we played a ton of different games) and an RPG lover. I worked on this by myself, but had input from testers, family, and friends.  Big thanks to the creators of many useful plugins too!<br><br>So you know where some of my influences come from, some of my favorite games are; Castlevania, Mario RPG, Panzer Dragoon Saga, Smash Bros., ‘Tales of’ games, Zelda, and Albert Odyssey.</h2></li></ul>",
