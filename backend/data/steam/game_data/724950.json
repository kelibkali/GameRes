Without warning they began killing anything in sight some even having the power to turn humans to slaves burned by fire. A mysterious group from this newly connected dimension granted 23 individuals power to help combat the enemy.No one knows why they were sympathetic towards humanity or why only 23 were granted power, but it helped give humanity a chance, up until the 23 were overrun. Now, the people who survived either are in hiding, or captured and sent to numerous islands around the world, and as for the 23, they are either dead, capture or missing.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/724950/extras/a62e31b7e2832383565d31dd3fad04a9.poster.avif?t=1562801911\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/724950/extras/a62e31b7e2832383565d31dd3fad04a9.webm?t=1562801911\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/724950/extras/a62e31b7e2832383565d31dd3fad04a9.mp4?t=1562801911\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/724950/extras/7a65eb496c5989a7ac51ed8b37c92e53.avif?t=1562801911\" width=616 height=108 /></span><br><br>Venture into the island fighting several enemies, and staying away from traps!. it is your job to find out what the enemy knows, where you friends are, and how you, and the rest of the 23 can once again try to save humanity.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/724950/extras/bf690f88d085db69476c0325ae1fb7f9.poster.avif?t=1562801911\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/724950/extras/bf690f88d085db69476c0325ae1fb7f9.webm?t=1562801911\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/724950/extras/bf690f88d085db69476c0325ae1fb7f9.mp4?t=1562801911\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/724950/extras/87445b5179c55f22c930021943ca96b2.avif?t=1562801911\" width=616 height=108 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Uniquely crafted story that will unravel as you play providing context for why the world is the way it is.<br></li><li>Read and listen to audio logs and notes to get a feel for the atmosphere and plight of the humans on the island.<br></li><li>Explore an artificial cemetery that houses deadly traps, enemies hunting any and everything, and humans trying to survive, looking for hope.<br></li><li>A Single player focused experience, no micro transactions, no season pass, what you see is what you get.<br></li><li>Straight forward Combat that should lend itself well to the gameplay.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/724950/extras/56d655765888c7df635132235ab7f106.poster.avif?t=1562801911\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/724950/extras/56d655765888c7df635132235ab7f106.webm?t=1562801911\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/724950/extras/56d655765888c7df635132235ab7f106.mp4?t=1562801911\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/724950/extras/a2466da9e6c69caa24c215345e2df80a.poster.avif?t=1562801911\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/724950/extras/a2466da9e6c69caa24c215345e2df80a.webm?t=1562801911\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/724950/extras/a2466da9e6c69caa24c215345e2df80a.mp4?t=1562801911\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
