    "description": "This original soundtrack by Rafael Langoni Smith comes in an innovative post-chiptune style. Each song combines digital with an analog post-process, for a warm result that is as unique as, and an integral part of the Stone Story RPG experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a special rendition of the game's music, remixed and sequenced specifically for a better listening experience. Included are 28 .mp3 tracks plus bonus compositions that cannot be found in the game.",
