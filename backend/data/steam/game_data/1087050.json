When Piet Mondrian awakens in a run-down art museum, he finds he's able to use an artwork smuggled out of the Canvas to travel back through time and find his other lost works. Join him and his friends on their journey through art history, as you spin your paddle around dynamically painted fields of blocks in a unique twist on classic arcade gameplay. Build your Museum, compete for global leaderboard glory, and create your own levels using the <i>Mondrian Maker</i> level editor. The Canvas is waiting.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1087050/extras/0138c7fea8abd869684ac2750bc61a0c.avif?t=1771870988\" width=600 height=156 /></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A New Twist on Arcade Classics</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Mondrian</i> features orbital block-breaking gameplay combined with dynamically generated elements to create a wholly unique, modern arcade experience. Bounce your ball into the field to pop all the blocks and collect the gems that come flying out. Grow the Stretch Paddle, heal the Breakerball, or slow the Speed Ball by grabbing gems. Grab three gems in a row to earn bonuses, trigger powerups that randomly spawn in the field, avoid obstacles, play as five different artists in seven game modes, and keep the ball from escaping or it's game over.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1087050/extras/df47b80a1c365ee85a6524418b67caf7.poster.avif?t=1771870988\" width=780 height=222 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1087050/extras/df47b80a1c365ee85a6524418b67caf7.webm?t=1771870988\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1087050/extras/df47b80a1c365ee85a6524418b67caf7.mp4?t=1771870988\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Dynamic Creations</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >While all levels are hand-crafted, you'll never play the exact same version of them twice.
