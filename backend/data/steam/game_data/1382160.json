In Monolithic you guide a pantheon of gods and their followers through time. From the dawn of creation to the fires of the apocalypse. Raise your civilization from the sand, build your forces, and grow your influence over humanity. Siege enemy settlements with armies of your followers and break their monoliths with devastating abilities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Play against your friends on Steam.<br></li><li>6 Unique gods each with unique abilities.<br></li><li>Powerful ultimate abilities.<br></li><li>Vibrant visual and sound effects.<br></li><li>Single player tutorial.</li></ul><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1382160/extras/4f9eebd2e14378cd35e037f666031f78.avif?t=1611087748\" width=612 height=136 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Command Deities, Build a Civilization</h2>The power of the gods is at your command. Select three gods from a roster of six to be your champions. Each god has unique traits and abilities that support domain and character of the deity. Different combinations of gods open new play styles and strategies to experiment with. The players start the match with their selected monoliths and a small cult of followers. From this small group, you will lead your followers to expand to new settlements, fight against your foes, conquer territory, and brave the flames of the end times!<br><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1382160/extras/a3565b213faf9b346b94d5a1ea5a0553.avif?t=1611087748\" width=612 height=136 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A focus on Strategy</h2>Monolithic emphasizes strategy over fast reflexes. As centuries pass both players methodically grow their civilizations and use their abilities to gain the upper hand. The game is won through proper use of devotion, cities, and time. Monolithic is less about actions per minute and more about how resources are managed. The focus for the player is when and where to use an ability, rather than on landing skill shots.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1382160/extras/1f24c48fca2e26266e201b8b371c85fd.avif?t=1611087748\" width=612 height=136 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The End Times</h2>All beginnings must have endings. The world and its inhabitants are fragile compared to the power of the gods, and the war they wage will tear the world apart. If the conflict is not ended swiftly, the world will end, and all of humanity will perish in the flames of the end times. As the last follower dies, so too does the deity, for a god is nothing without devotion. But perhaps even the end of the world can be leveraged with the right strategy.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1382160/extras/b7513a6a5c51aa7c90765b418fcb1165.avif?t=1611087748\" width=612 height=136 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About Fowl Machinations</h2>Fowl Machinations originated as a team of Champlain College graduates and Monolithic is our capstone project, but we found that there were more features and content we wanted to add even after graduation.
