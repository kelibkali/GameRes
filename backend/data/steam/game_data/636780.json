What at first appear to be simple bandits turns out to be more frightening when they discover the raiders are not mere brigands, but foul Orcs. Worse, they have taken captives. With the help of several locals, the PCs must chase down these Orcs in an attempt to return the villagers.<br><br>The PCs chase the Orcs all the way back to their village.
