    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>MiniShips Mode</strong></h2>The Fastest Game Mode on PiraCrash. Here you control Miniships so you will shoot 3 projeticles from the sides of your ship. You can throw grenades and use special likes &quot;Radial Attack&quot; and &quot;Dive Special&quot; which is like a shark surprise attack. Don't blink for a second or you will lose. You will need to jump and parry a lot to avoid getting hit.  When you master this mode it will look like professional Tennis in terms of speed and agilty. It feels so good.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1220200/extras/f53716050d61a1d0b4d9e9a55c80ab3a.poster.avif?t=1677892403\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1220200/extras/f53716050d61a1d0b4d9e9a55c80ab3a.webm?t=1677892403\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1220200/extras/f53716050d61a1d0b4d9e9a55c80ab3a.mp4?t=1677892403\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>SnookerPaddle Mode</strong></h2>Pong mixed with Tennis. Protect your Chests. The first player to destroy the 3 chests from your opponent wins. Here you have 2 ways to bat the shots. Light Bat and Heavy Bat. You need to choose the best timing for those 2 styles and also take care with specials attacks and multiple shots. The direction you are facing also influences the direction so you need to pay attention and master the movements. It feels great batting on this mode.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1220200/extras/b52eff6870fd05bc7b1456e14e11cb69.poster.avif?t=1677892403\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1220200/extras/b52eff6870fd05bc7b1456e14e11cb69.webm?t=1677892403\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1220200/extras/b52eff6870fd05bc7b1456e14e11cb69.mp4?t=1677892403\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>360 Mode</strong></h2>The most friendly and weird game mode. Here your Rubber Duck will be rotating all the time and you need to move and shoot at the right timing to hit your friend. You can also throw grenades, parry and use specials. Seems simple but let me see how you handle this game when both players are on Hit Kill.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1220200/extras/220f35d8a603632b585d9ac3f0678bfd.poster.avif?t=1677892403\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1220200/extras/220f35d8a603632b585d9ac3f0678bfd.webm?t=1677892403\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1220200/extras/220f35d8a603632b585d9ac3f0678bfd.mp4?t=1677892403\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Customize your Rubber Duckies</strong></h2>More than 30 Hats for you customize.
