    "description": "The original soundtrack for the video game DRILLY WILLIS, a Metroidvania starring a character with a drill for a head and powers unleashed by playing songs on their guitar. Written and performed by the solo developer and owner of Private Pook Games, Mike Grosso.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDrilly Willis features 15 dynamic post rock tracks filled with pulsing, layered guitars that will charge you up while playing the game and inspire you when listening to the alone. While it may at times sound like many instruments were used, everything you hear was made by either a guitar or bass played and manipulated in a variety of ways.",
