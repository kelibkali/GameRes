    "description": "Fourzy is a board/puzzle game where the goal is to connect four or more game pieces called Fourzies. The game is played in a variety of different worlds with obstacles on the board that create ever changing gameplay. Game boards can be both procedurally generated or carefully crafted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe experience is short, intense, logical, and each game feels like a new puzzle to unwrap and solve. An entire game can be completed in just a few minutes. Play through hundreds of levels in the puzzle adventure or play casually with friends face to face or online.",
