He just needs a break. Perhaps one good case could help him turn things around. <br><br>Then one evening, he gets a call from a Doctor Offenhauser who wants to hire him. The Doc doesn't give many details over the phone, but insists it's an urgent matter that can't wait. <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/963730/extras/67a2e278c9c053dde0864db2d37b1472.avif?t=1674037636\" width=296 height=294 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Some Game Features: </h2><br>* An exciting turn-based and interactive battle-system. Quick reflexes and a strategic use of actions can help you to overcome dangerous foes. Weapons include a .38 Special gun which can be a Detective's best friend when in a tough jam. It shoots fast and deals a lot of damage, but ammo is limited so choose to use it wisely. There's also a trusty Combat-Knife used for melee attacks. Plus you'll have skills and items that can also help. <br><br>* Walls in the foreground will become solid as the Player-character moves away from them, and become translucent when nearing them to help you better explore an area. <br><br>* Fitting music and sound-effects used throughout the game. <br><br>* Some sounds (fire in the fireplace, clocks-ticking, etc...) will become louder or softer as the Player-character nears or walks away from the source. <br><br>* A dark story and a creepy manor to explore. <br><br>* A nice looking menu-system. <br><br>* Use of lighting and other cool effects.",
