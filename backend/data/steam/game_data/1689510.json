With the pre-set cameras of each scene, GMs can view and show their players the surrounding from several angles. All the parameters set in the application are animated, including the weather, sunlight, and moonlight effects. Now the players can actually see the dark bushes swaying in wind, in the light of their campfire, or the scattered shine of the sun dancing on the surface of the flowing river they are planning to cross at the ford.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1689510/extras/e086da6e6ace210fcec9f4772b3a1c8c.poster.avif?t=1647465398\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1689510/extras/e086da6e6ace210fcec9f4772b3a1c8c.webm?t=1647465398\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1689510/extras/e086da6e6ace210fcec9f4772b3a1c8c.mp4?t=1647465398\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>And when push comes to shove, the battle maps of the same scene tell them exactly how far they can move in a round, which enemy they can’t shoot at behind the rock, and tell the GM what their moves are going to be simply by pointing.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1689510/extras/7152fd8f10fe5d75ca220dc38405ccb7.poster.avif?t=1647465398\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1689510/extras/7152fd8f10fe5d75ca220dc38405ccb7.webm?t=1647465398\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1689510/extras/7152fd8f10fe5d75ca220dc38405ccb7.mp4?t=1647465398\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>For more info please read our FAQ: ",
