Like all attempts to be immortalized, there was a curse attached: the three were caught in an endless cycle of rebirth and death. Only one of the three could be alive at a time so as soon as one of them died, the other sprang back to life.<br><br><br>You play as the warrior: a melee-based fighter who only uses weapons such as swords, spears, and crossbows. Depending on the enchantment on his/her weapon, the warrior can charge at an enemy at a high speed, pulverize the ground, and summon swords back to their hand. <br><br><br>Trailer Music: The Fat Rat Infinite Power<br>Music used in game: The Fat Rat Xenogenesis and The Fat Rat Unity",
