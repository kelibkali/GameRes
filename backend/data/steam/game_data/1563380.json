    "description": "Play as a former captain (of a space ship) on the run in the frist part &quot;painful days at home&quot; when your ship crashed and you had to hide inside the home of some unknown guy. Enjoy a gameplay with no hassle, as time doesn't matter here, promise. Just combine items you find to make your way back into space. <br><br>This is a promotional shortgame where you can expect a playtime of around <strong>25 mins</strong>. But it heavily depends on you. If you're a hardcore progamer, experienced in all historical p&amp;c adventures, this is a simple walkthrough for you. If so, be our guest and consider yourself a patron of the next part, which shall have a playtime of 10-20 hours estimated. Your comments will greatly help us making a much more accurate guess about that as well.<br><br>For the not-so-hard coregamer, just enjoy clicking around and guess what to do next. There are some hints and some &quot;hidden&quot; items to combine. Have fun and post your thougts about it, as they will influence the next part quite a bit which is planned to come this year.<br><br>What's in the game:<br>*graphics<br>*animations<br>*sounds<br>*music<br>*story<br><br>What's not:<br>*lootboxes<br><br>Medium important note: Be sure to check the &quot;manual&quot; included, especially about using the inventory by clicking the top black bar in the game... !",
