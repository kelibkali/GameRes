    "description": "Fight with a small team through floors of hostile machines, tweak your team to overcome increasingly more powerful enemies, learn from your mistakes as you are overwhelmed and plan better for your next attempt.  Be careful though, there is no going back after you end your turn. You will have to live with the consequences of your actions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBroken Metal is a tactical roguelike, each floor is randomly generated along with what enemies appear, each unit has a random skill tree, and if a unit dies, there is no getting them back.",
