The tower is filled with different types of locks and keys that are scattered across the environment. <br><br>To <i><strong>unlock the mysteries of the tower</strong></i> and solve its challenges you will need to <i><strong>use your magical gloves</strong></i>. These gloves disable the gravity of objects, enabling you to make them fly anywhere you want. Allowing you to continue exploring the tower.<br><br>However, this journey is not without danger. The <i><strong>corruption is spreading</strong></i> through the tower and will corrupt anything in its path. Contact with the corruption will disable your gloves' powers, and any object that it touches will immediately be destroyed.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1248270/extras/a131a371fe3f561d5209f7ecd38f5d70.avif?t=1593690189\" width=600 height=104 /></span><br><br>The non-euclidian portals allow for smooth seemingly-impossible movement from one location to another.<br><br>By combining non-euclidian level design and room-scale movement we enable you to<i><strong> walk through the entire game in one continuous path</strong></i> while <i><strong>staying safely within the bounds of your playspace</strong></i>. This creates the feeling that you are exploring a large environment while avoiding the shortcomings of other VR movement solutions.
