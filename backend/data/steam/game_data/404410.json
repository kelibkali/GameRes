Work your way up from a relatively wimpy shuttle, cargo ship, or fighter, to a highly upgraded and customized flagship. Grow your fleet while exploring an expansive galaxy with hundreds of systems. Earn money by carrying passengers or cargo, escorting convoys, bounty hunting, mining asteroids, or plundering and capturing enemy ships.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Write Your Story</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/404410/extras/851aa02115d296b81156f71365307773.avif?t=1769891345\" width=600 height=400 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Enter the 31st century and choose from one of multiple starting locations and backgrounds where you set out on your own journey as the captain of a new ship. Take sides in a civil war, or ignore the story line and just enjoy exploring the galaxy at your own pace. The main story line alone takes about 8-16 hours to play through, with over a hundred hours worth of story content spread across the galaxy in the form of other story lines both big and small.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Extensive Plugin Support</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/404410/extras/50b4f33d07b4356fe19fd6b14746581e.avif?t=1769891345\" width=600 height=400 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The game's content can be added to using the plugin system, which allows anyone with a text editor and a paint program to create new ships, weapons, missions, and more to the game. All of the game's content is built using the same system, so anything you see in the vanilla game can be done in a plugin. The capabilities of plugins are fully documented on our GitHub wiki.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A FOSS Labor of Love</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/404410/extras/3b04916c7f02a2283212f2d14bf65cb9.avif?t=1769891345\" width=1280 height=544 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Endless Sky is free, open source, and cross platform (Windows, Mac, and Linux). The game has been developed for over 10 years as a labor of love from hundreds of volunteer contributors. Updates occur regularly with three major updates every year. Over time, the game will continue to expand as contributors add new missions, story lines, alien species, places to explore, sound effects, artwork, gameplay mechanics, quality-of-life improvements, and more.</p>",
