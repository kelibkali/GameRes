These are important to control. Each of them gives you more actions you can do in the state.<br><br><strong>Buildings</strong><br>In each city, you will find different buildings with different benefits. However you need to appoint key members in the management of the buildings first.<br><br><strong>State laws</strong><br>The state laws determine the rules and the course of the entire state which everyone, including the player, must follow.
