    "description": "Vision becomes reality – after the first battery electric buses of the type eCitaro have been standardly put in operation in Hamburg in summer 2018, this modern city bus now finds its way into OMSI 2 as well.<br><br>Currently, there are already 20 vehicles of this type in use in Hamburg (state April 2020) and you can find them also in other German cities like Berlin.<br><br>All the special features of the original can be virtually discovered here like cornering light, automatic light, rain sensor, the new interior design, features of the high voltage electrical system and much more. Of course, compressor, air-condition, and power steering are completely operated by electricity, too. You will notice this in the bus’s behaviour and sound. In comparison to the add-on “Hamburg Buses”, 44 new sounds have been added.<br><br>In addition to the known Hamburg ticket printer and LED destination display, the e-buses have a two-part widescreen passenger display and the Validation- and Sales-System (PVS) with which the passengers can check their digital tickets.<br><br>The vehicle’s implementation into the game is based on original training documents of the HOCHBAHN and on experiences in the regular service. You can even charge the bus in the bus depot by using the standard “refuel” button in OMSI 2. This looks best if you are standing under a carport with a charging cable like in the map Hamburg HafenCity. Of course, the add-on also includes some close to reality versions of paint from all over Germany, as well as 4K repaint templates for your own advertisement.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1317200/extras/1a793997ff716d4975eae772eaa367ae.avif?t=1591257593\" width=616 height=68 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>New 2019 interior design<br></li><li>High detailed mesh with 2K and optionally 4K textures<br></li><li>Realistic high voltage system with power and SOC display<br></li><li>SOS lighting function<br></li><li>44 new sounds<br></li><li>Animated passenger interior display<br></li><li>Functional PVS for passengers and driver display<br></li><li>Cornering light, automatic light, and rain sensor<br></li><li>Numerous realistic advertisements<br></li><li>Templates for own repaints<br></li><li>Rechargeable battery system</li></ul>",
