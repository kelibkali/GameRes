    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Welcome to the SCP-087 VR Survivor.</h2> This is a small indie survival rogue-like horror game based on the SCP foundation lore. My name is AlexTheCreator and I am the author of this game. I'm gonna quickly explain o you quickly what this is game about.<br><br>The original SCP-087 story is based on an infinite stairwell. If you are SCP-fan like me, you might remember the first SCP-087 game which was just basically a walking simulator. It was unique when it first released, however it isn't that much now. Nowadays you can't just enjoy a game where you walk down some stairs while getting scared by simplest jumpscares. Even in VR... Trust me, I made the first version of this game just like I've described above. Nothing special, very simple and not entertaining at all. So I havedecided to turn the tables!<br><br>SCP-087 can have a huge effect on the subject's mind... So now you are one of the SCP Scientists which, for unknown reasons, had gotten inside SCP-087. You start off by regaining consciousness and see different corridors in front of you. The setting is like a basement. You recall that something similar was written in one of the classified documents on SCP-087, and you understand that there is no other solution for you than begin looking for a way out. SCP-087 is afraid of light and noise, that's why you'll have to collect all the objects that can make noise, help craft torches, repair lamps and prevent SCP-087-01 from getting you. Your goal is to survive in a procedurally generated world filled with danger and loneliness.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >There is 2 games inside</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/808220/extras/83c41a7a8fcf9b6062c043d42f80e354.avif?t=1548767499\" width=306 height=254 /></span><br>I decided to publush &quot;stairwell&quot; version too, if you pusrchase the game, second one located in same directory.
