    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Scarred Lands Player's Guide</h2><strong> A Land Where Legends Walk</strong><br>Drawing enthusiastically on Greek mythology, the revised and re-imagined Scarred Lands nonetheless retains its place as a modern fantasy RPG setting. This is a world shaped by gods and monsters, and only the greatest of heroes can expect to be counted among them. The most populous continent of Scarn, Ghelspad, plays host to vast unexplored regions, hides unsolved riddles from ancient cultures, and taunts adventures with the promise of undiscovered riches hidden among the ruins of older civilizations.<br>Yet the myths of the Scarred Lands are relatively recent events. The effects of the Titanswar still ripple through the world, and the heroines and villains of many of these stories are part of living memory, if not still living.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong> The Award-Winning Fantasy Setting Returns</strong></h2>Scarred Lands has been a favorite fantasy setting since the release of the Creature Collection for the d20 System in 2000. In subsequent years, over 40 titles were published for Scarred Lands, making it one of the most fully supported fantasy RPG settings ever and the premiere product line of Sword &amp; Sorcery Studios.<br>Now, Onyx Path Publishing and Nocturnal Media have partnered to bring this cherished fantasy setting back to your gaming table!<br><i> Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by:</i><br><strong> John Waite</strong><br><strong> Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included 5E Compatible ruleset.",
