Build yourself a new home high up in the sky using materials you collected. Make it look cozy with decorations but it has to be functional too. Your airship will hold the most important parts such as smelter, crafting station and all your farms. Take good care of it and it will last your whole journey.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2007480/extras/118b06f3d70f2d1b09e8af132e847f06.poster.avif?t=1671106703\" width=608 height=342 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2007480/extras/118b06f3d70f2d1b09e8af132e847f06.webm?t=1671106703\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2007480/extras/118b06f3d70f2d1b09e8af132e847f06.mp4?t=1671106703\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Crafting</strong></h2>Crafting is used to make tools to help you get resources quicker. You can find new recipes on islands so exploring them really pays out. <strong>Upgrade your tools</strong>, use iron you found to make iron pickaxe, use gold to make a gold axe. Every tool has its durability, so keep an eye on that. When the tool breaks you need to jump onto your airship and craft a new one.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Exploration</strong></h2><strong>Explore a randomly generated world</strong> with a huge variety of islands. Different biomes like a desert island, grass island or even ice island will hold valuable resources and each biome has their own crops you can take and farm on your ship. Airdrift encourages <strong>exploration </strong>with story and also with discovery of new crafting or building recipes.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2007480/extras/1160c0c0c69b495d1e91ce1918c42057.poster.avif?t=1671106703\" width=608 height=342 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2007480/extras/1160c0c0c69b495d1e91ce1918c42057.webm?t=1671106703\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2007480/extras/1160c0c0c69b495d1e91ce1918c42057.mp4?t=1671106703\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Resource gathering</strong></h2>You will need materials to build your airship with. This is why you need to visit islands near you to gather some wood, iron or other materials you need to expand and craft. You can use hands to gather some smaller resources like rocks on ground, sticks or flowers but for a larger one you need to craft proper tools on your airship.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2007480/extras/5bece278019b141689c007f2fdf2bc25.poster.avif?t=1671106703\" width=608 height=342 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2007480/extras/5bece278019b141689c007f2fdf2bc25.webm?t=1671106703\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2007480/extras/5bece278019b141689c007f2fdf2bc25.mp4?t=1671106703\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Combat</strong></h2>Not all islands will be peaceful.
