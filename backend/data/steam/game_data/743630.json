    "description": "NOTE: <strong>This DLC includes the main game, The Lord of the Rings: Living Card Game.</strong> <br><br>The Shire Founder's Pack is the entry level pack for purchasing into the Early Access period of The Lord of the Rings: Living Card Game.  This pack will give you access to the game as well as the extra content listed below.  You may purchase this pack and later add The Istari and/or Steward of Gondor packs to gain additional levels of content and exclusives.  All three packs are separately stackable so buying one and later adding the others will not overlap content.  Or you can buy all three packs at once and additional exclusive content in The Mithril Bundle.<br><br>Similar to the table top game which inspired it, The Lord of the Rings: Living Card Game follows a unique game economy where you purchase only the items in game that you wish to own.  There are no random packs to buy.  <br><br><strong>The Shire Founder's Pack includes:</strong><br><br><strong>The Lord of the Rings: Living Card Game Core Set</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>4 Heroes<br></li><li>68 Player Cards<br></li><li><i>Classic</i> and <i>New</i> Sauron Card Backs<br></li><li><i>Classic</i> and <i>New</i> Player Player Backs<br></li><li>3,000 Valor Points</li></ul><br><strong>And these additional Shire Founder's Pack Items:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>5,000 Bonus Valor Points (for a total of 8,000 points)<br></li><li>Exclusive <strong>Shire</strong> Player Tag<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/743630/extras/2c2b9080df9a65c6a34952aafede56eb.avif?t=1694003378\" width=250 height=64 /></span><br></li><li>Exclusive <strong>Shire</strong> Player Avatar and Frame<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/743630/extras/e617d0367e6366698733eed14eb0e6ae.avif?t=1694003378\" width=114 height=114 /></span><br></li><li>Exclusive <strong>Shire</strong> Card Back<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/743630/extras/92e51d60875dbce6ca810073c8ebe7f1.avif?t=1694003378\" width=428 height=600 /></span><br></li><li><strong>Frodo</strong> Avatar Unlocked<br></li><li><i>A Friend in Need</i> (Uncommon) Card Unlocked</li></ul><br>Valor Points are the in-game currency which can be used to purchase new Valor Cards. <br><br><i><strong>Please Note</strong> that this pack is included as part of the <strong>Mithril Bundle</strong>.</i>",
