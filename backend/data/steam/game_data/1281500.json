    "description": "Through forsaken groves and drowning skyscrapers, Resolutiion’s soundscapes cover the calm, the storm, and everything in between. Melancholic vibes and extensive synths alternate brutish beats and industrial riffs: Alice in Wonderland meets Blade Runner.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese 57 tracks by artist and composer Gerrit Wolf are split across two records, each with their own distinct character.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Ambient” encapsulates the mesmerizing moments of a new, emerging world: foreign strings vibrate from the ocean floor while a floating city’s engines exhale soothing white noise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Assault” is where the claw strikes the sword. Enemies clash, and their energy transforms into a rhythmic thunder of electric noise, drums, and violent guitars. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe only way out is to dance.",
