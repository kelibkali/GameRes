    "description": "<i>Deleveled</i> features an original chiptune soundtrack composed by Patrick Nance. Jazz, blues, and funk form the basis of each track, which creates a distinct downtempo sound not often heard in the realm of chiptune.<br><br>The entire soundtrack was composed with FamiTracker, a tool designed to emulate the sound capabilities of the NES. In addition to high-quality MP3s and lossless WAVs, the FamiTracker source files are included as a reference to anybody interested in how every sound on every track was made.",
