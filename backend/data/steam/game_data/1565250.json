    "description": "Rising Spire is a turn-based RPG that breathes new life into a long loved genre, putting a fresh twist to the classic turn based combat system, story progression, and exploration, while delivering the feel-good and fun spirit of the ‘90s golden titles.<br><br>Born from our love for timeless names such as Final Fantasy and Persona, Rising Spire takes you on an epic journey through the harsh world of Malus - a world that seems keen on rejecting any and all gods. Learn what it takes to survive in these untamed wilds, form unexpected alliances, find the balance between humanity and angelic powers and try to survive the divine army trying to kill you at every step.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1565250/extras/cdbe890ddee96f9373f568342bba3911.avif?t=1748982657\" width=616 height=180 /></span><br><br>Rising Spire ditches the traditional class system in favor of a weapons switch system. As you progress through the game, you unlock new weapons, each with its unique abilities, runes and style of gameplay. Tweak your build and find the best combination of weapons to fit your style and lead you to victory. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1565250/extras/e6d5f72184b935c782d135f3866daf2a.poster.avif?t=1748982657\" width=616 height=180 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1565250/extras/e6d5f72184b935c782d135f3866daf2a.webm?t=1748982657\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1565250/extras/e6d5f72184b935c782d135f3866daf2a.mp4?t=1748982657\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>You, Atlas, are a Nephilim. Not quite human, not quite Divine, you can walk both worlds the same - you can see a soul and you can also touch it.

Some secrets are only revealed in the moonlight, but take caution - while you may see (and avoid) your enemies during the day, the night brings forth random encounters and powerful enemies! <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1565250/extras/88000c07529a27b560efa0e4a297954d.avif?t=1748982657\" width=616 height=180 /></span><br><br>Malus is a living world with a rich but dark past. While Rising Spire explores the classic JRPG themes of adventure, growth, and friendship, it also gives you a glimpse into darker themes such as loss, betrayal and revenge. Between unexpected twists and heavy subjects, you can also expect silly and lighthearted events to pop up. It is a <i>real world</i>, after all.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1565250/extras/a16884d361a9075bd4b47c33c79b645b.avif?t=1748982657\" width=616 height=180 /></span><br><br>The story of Rising Spire is told by those around you, and the relationships you form shape your journey. Each character in Malus is created with a rich and full existence - dreams, fears, quirks and bad days. While you have the liberty to go straight forward and rush to the Spire, the full story can only be uncovered by spending time with those you meet, learning about them, helping them and creating powerful bonds.
