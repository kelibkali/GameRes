Strategy is your weapon.</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Sky Is Arrows</i> is a real-time tactical roguelike where every second counts. Control a powerful hero, command five unique army groups, and adapt to a battlefield that changes as quickly as you can think. The deeper you go, the stronger your enemies become—and the more decisive your choices must be.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Final Boss returns every five Acts. You cannot stop him.
