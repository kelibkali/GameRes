    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >This app is removed from Steam and the owner has requested the data removal of it from any third-party sites.</h2><br><strong>Unlimited is a new generation voxel world game in a mysterious world.<br>Together with unlimited possibilities and an immersive story, we aim to make the best voxel world game.<br>If you enjoy any other voxel game, you will probably enjoy this game even more.<br>make the best voxel world game. If you enjoy any other voxel game, you will probably enjoy this game even more.</strong><br><br><strong>Build Whatever Is On Your Mind</strong><br>The building system in Unlimited is very simple to use but has unlimited possbilities. Build a hole in the ground, a small house, a town, a castle, a huge sky base or whatever else is on your mind! With a huge amount of blocks and helpful tools for building, the space is the limit.<br><br><strong>Explore The Universe</strong><br>Wanna live on Mars? Wanna live in the middle of the Ocean? Wanna live in a middle of a blue trees forest? Wanna live in hell? You can!<br>With the Dimensions system you can travel between dozens of Dimensions, each one different and unique from the other one, different blocks, resources, structures, biomes and more. Every different save with a different seed will cause the Dimensions to change a lot, from trees to ocean height - this way the game is a lot more replayable.<br><br><strong>Automate Everything</strong><br>Use the Action System to automate everything you want! We aim to make almost everything in the game farmable using different and interesting mechanics. From a small hidden entrance to your base to a huge building machine, your ceativity is the limit! Also, we might add some &quot;intended bugs&quot; for players that like doing stuff differently, so keep your eyes open for that!<br><br><strong>Creatures Nests</strong><br>Did someone say creatures spawning everywhere from thin air? Nope, not in our game.<br>The Nests act as basically spawn zones in the game, they spawn creatures in a random range near them, and each Nest has a random creature it spawns. You can destroy it to stop the spawns but it wont give you the spawner. If you want to farm mobs, thats probably the best way you can currently do it.<br><br><strong>End Game Progression: (Still Heavily Under Progress)</strong><br>- Without too much spoilers, the player founds himself in a mysteries universe and he slowly progresses into finding out more about this universe, including how it was made and whats threatening it...<br>- We believe that when players get to the end of a game like this one, they should be a lot more powerful and have a lot more tools to make things less grindy and easier for them so they can just create stuff easier. We are going to include things like super armor that lets you fly to help you building and fighting, tool that gives you higher range for placing and destroying blocks, more interesting ways and things to farm and more!",
