Furthermore, small kites are a lot more hectic than big ones.<br><br><strong>Maps</strong><br>Explore your environment in one of the three main maps with different themes: Caribbean-style, lake and an icy world.<br>To bring more variety to the visual appeal of the maps, you can kite from morning until sundown with clear sky or overcast weather.<br><br><strong>Competition</strong><br>For the more competitive players there are two main modes: Freestyle and Time trials.<br>In either of those modes you can beat the high score and compare yourself to the world's best ranking players.<br>After completing certain goals you will be rewarded with bonus kites and boards.<br><br>Due to the nature of kiteboarding you will need to master not only the board controls but also the kite, too. <br>In the beginning, for new players, it can be tricky to control the kite and navigate the board at the same time.<br>Just like in real life, the sport is hard to pick up but once you get going, you will be hooked immediately!",
