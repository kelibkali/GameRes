There are 2 civilizations on the continent of Lauren. Above the civilizations are seas, and below them, vast forests. There is magic here, there are secrets waiting to be discovered and many surprises waiting for those who step outside the borders.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1483820/extras/1ce8d36af1858b28ab61cdfcdb11b0ec.avif?t=1661373024\" width=596 height=150 /></span><br><br>     You will portray a character who begins his life on one side of the continent, at the very corner. Once upon a time, there was a pikeman with a yellow hoodie. He's after his own shadow, not the rules of others. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1483820/extras/5a816a7bdf4c94a208041f2690e46a50.avif?t=1661373024\" width=600 height=150 /></span><br><br>     What would you do? That's the question! Puzzle structure inspired by tabletop role-playing games will be waiting for you. The story will put you in a position and after that you are as free as can be! There will be a game master under artificial intelligence control. You will progress in your adventure with the method or choices you have discovered, not the solutions that the producer puts you under conditions.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1483820/extras/ab67538f2f41d2d2ee0206704a179673.avif?t=1661373024\" width=598 height=150 /></span><br><br>     This is where the situation is most enjoyable! You are in a kind of theater play. There is a character and scene assigned to you. Hundreds of props depicted in the book will be thrown at you. Gameplay comes into play here, we promise a world where we code in a way that goes beyond the written rules and where you can interact in many ways. So this theater play will feel a little different and comfortable.",
