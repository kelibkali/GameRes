Also this will add a <i>visual distortion effect</i>. The higher your score, the higher is the intensity of the effect. There are about <strong>20</strong> such visual distortion effects. You will get to see all of them by the score of ~<strong>3000</strong> if you collect all.<br><br>The wider your circling radius, the more colorful the sounds get. Also, the more colorful the screen gets. Having a small radius will make the screen almost black and white.<br><br>Use headphones for best experience.",
