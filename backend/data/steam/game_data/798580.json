After years of torture, former elite soldier Ian lives in a safe house with his brother, struggling with memory loss and the effects of the experiments he was forced to endure.

Driven by his desperate need for the truth and a thirst for revenge; Ian, aided by his brother, sets out on a thrilling hunt for the masterminds of this conspiracy, hoping to uncover exactly what was done to him and why? As Ian plunges into a criminal underworld in pursuit of his only lead, he is forced to use his powers more and more to survive. But with each use, his mind becomes ever more detached from reality, revealing the presence of an even darker force at play. <br><br><strong>Gameplay Features</strong> <br>- A story driven supernatural thriller <br>Past Cure is a cinematic, story driven experience where the player follows the struggle of a broken man searching for the missing pieces of his mind.
