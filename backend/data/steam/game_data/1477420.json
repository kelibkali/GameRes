    "description": "Neo-Zero is a role-playing game which takes place in a hi-tech, dystopian, computer-simulated world. Neo-Zero features highly unsafe <strong>lab tests</strong> (puzzles) and <strong>rhythmic battles</strong> against husky military recruits.<br><br>In the 1990s, a scientist created the Neo-Zero™ Simulation Software to simulate a real world with real people. Their intent was to perform experiments on these virtual people. Shockingly, the simulated world devolved into a dystopia controlled by a single, abusive government. The world had started to build an artificial intelligence that could break itself out of Neo-Zero, so the scientist shut the Neo-Zero project down.<br>... two decades later, the (now broke) scientist decided to sell Neo-Zero as a video game.<br><br>As you boot up your copy of Neo-Zero for the first time, you will be entered into the world that the scientist had shut down.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1477420/extras/298f1e19d7f04f7e5962cd4042ffd5b0.avif?t=1619193521\" width=534 height=212 /></span><br><br><strong>You play as Apollo</strong>, an aspiring junior scientist at Oxylabs who is forced to perform tests using Oxylabs’ Propulsion Gun Prototype. During a morning of testing, Apollo finds himself stuck in the middle of a sticky situation: a military-enforced shutdown of the unethical Oxylabs.<br><br><strong>Aela </strong>serves as the overseer to your tests on the day of the Oxylabs shutdown. She assists you on the journey to escape the facilities and prevent the government from laying their hands on Oxylabs’ most powerful device: Project Foxtrot.<br><br>After Oxylabs researchers determined that their world had a 99% chance of being a computer simulation, they developed <strong>Project Foxtrot</strong>, an artificial intelligence designed to exploit a glitch in the simulation. However, leaving Foxtrot powered on for more than 5 minutes has resulted in the simulated world falling apart...<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1477420/extras/330b4ea5cb99dde70108ee3c9debea76.avif?t=1619193521\" width=534 height=212 /></span><br><br><strong>Ferdinand</strong> is a coworker who led Oxylabs' Project Foxtrot.
