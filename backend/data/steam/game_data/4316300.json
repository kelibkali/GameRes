Each character harnesses their Spirit Power to use a unique set of class-based abilities associated with one of five flavor profiles. Match enemy flavor cravings to break down their defenses and leave them stuffed. With each round, build up your Ultimate meter to use special group ultimates and serve up some devastating damage. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >MECH-SPLORATION</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Traverse unique villages in a customizable and upgradable ancient spirit-mech named Goddess.
