    "description": "<strong>Create music - with lasers in VR !</strong><br><br>Play on a simulation of the Laser Harp from the 80's, with original samples taken from an Elka Synthex for an authentic experience.<br><br>Change octaves and scales from the controller to provide a full keyboard from C1 to D4 that you can control on-the-fly, this is a close simulation - including the limitations of that original 1980s system with just a few tweaks for convenience (the original didn't have multi-coloured lasers!) .  This is aimed at enthusiasts so isn't a game, just your opportunity to play a Laser Harp.<br><br><strong>*** Tracked Controller Support Note ***</strong><br>The controls are optimised for the HTC Vive however Occulus Touch controllers do work, improvements to customise the UI and responsiveness for starting the Memory Game mode will be in a future update along with Touch controller specific instructions.",
