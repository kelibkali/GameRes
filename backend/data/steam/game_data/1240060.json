Royalty of the festival circuit, these two bands combine virtuosic instrumental playing with fast, inventive rhythms, to produce new tunes in traditional styles played with beauty, energy and swagger.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Accessibility and Settings</h2>The following settings area available and may help depending on your needs:<br><br><strong>Narrative</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Reading speed setting: How long the dialogue gives you before it animates out again.<br></li><li>Allow mild profanity: On by default.<br></li><li>Unfortunately we don't currently have any font or text size settings, although it is planned for a future update. Our text size is however relatively generous - we we suggest you look at screenshots full screen where you intend to play to get a sense of how readable it is for you.</li></ul><br><strong>Controls</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Alternative gamepad controls: By default choices and interaction is on the A button, and jump is on the Y button. But for those that find it more natural for jump to be on the A button there is an alternative control scheme.<br></li><li> Remap keyboard controls: Full remapping of all controls in game is possible. Mouse buttons are assignable although general mouse movement control isn't supported.</li></ul><br><strong>Gameplay</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Trip less when running to music: Normally during the rhythm running mechanic 3 stumbles will cause the music and momentum to stop. With this setting on you are allowed infinite stumbles. (However some types of platforming mistakes may still cause failure.)<br></li><li> Never flail while climbing: Occasionally a quick time event may occur during climbing that requires you to quickly press a button to re-attach to the wall. This option disables the mechanic completely.<br></li><li> Easier music rhythms: During the rhythm run mechanic, use less complicated rhythms to make the game easier.<br></li><li> Single jump button only: After the first few rhythm runs the game will introduce a second jump button to introduce difficulty and complexity. This option will mean you only ever require a single jump button during the rhythm mechanic.<br></li><li> Weather and Environment: How strongly poor weather will affect your health and recovery.<br></li><li> Lightning: By default switched on, this is a strobe effect during thunderstorms that can be disabled.<br></li><li> Highlight routes when looking further: By default switched on, when using the &quot;Look Further&quot; mechanic (zooming out), this will highlight the available surface that can be walked and climbed on for easier navigation. For players that prefer more of a challenge and to look at the raw art only, this can be disabled.</li></ul><br><strong>Audio and Vibration</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The following volumes can be independently controlled: master volume, ambient music volume, rhythm music volume, speech volume.<br></li><li> Gamepad vibration can be disabled.</li></ul>",
