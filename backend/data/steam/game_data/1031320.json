There is really nothing I can do about that. This game has been tested and does not include any malware. If the problem persists, please start the game with the &quot;engine.exe&quot; in the &quot;bin&quot; folder instead, perhaps using compatibility mode. I am sorry for the inconvenience and hope you will still find enjoyment within the halls of the castle. Sincerely, Ezekiel Rage, Developer</i></p>",
