    "description": "The Goblins have been driven out of their homeland by man, chased through the mines by the Dwarfs and enslaved by the Orcs. Tech, Heavy, Tiny and of course the formidable King Hung Ree embark on a journey home – but before they can set out, Tech first needs to escape from his Orc prison and then round up the rest of the group. Only by joining forces will they manage to cross the territory of the Orcs. Along the way, they'll encounter all kinds of obstacles and puzzles that they'll only be able to overcome together.<br><br><strong><u>Tech:</u></strong> He is the nerd and genius of the group. Give him a plan and some materials and he'll build a helicopter out of bubble gum and a chicken.<br><strong><u>Heavy:</u></strong> There's nothing that Heavy can't move – apart from King...<br><strong><u>Tiny:</u></strong> He is small, inconspicuous and can get into everywhere.
