WHO'S GETTING OFF THE TRAIN TO-DAY?! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is the question players will be asking themselves each morning in The Kingdom of Gardenia. You play as Roman, an orphan and former soldier, who travels to Gardenia in search of meaningful employment. There you will meet King Theseus IV, who has set you four objectives, which you will need to complete in order to help him restore the kingdom to its former glory:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFame - Earn stars from visitor reviews, which they will post in the train station post box as they depart. Visitor reviews are broken down into four categories, with one star awarded for each category: Food - feed them enough of their favourite food in the Tavern, Flora - place their favourite flowers, plants or trees in the West Garden, where they are likely to see them, Florints - impress them with the wealth of the kingdom, the local currency is Gardenian Florint, Fondness - get to know them, by finding the right time and place to talk to them, as they peruse the garden during their visit. Don't forget to collect your 'meet and greet' and 'bon voyage' bonus stars by greeting visitors at the station as they arrive and wishing them farewell as they leave.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFortune - Earn money each day when visitors buy a ticket to visit the kingdom as they get off the train. You can also earn money by selling flowers, plants and trees to visitors from the Flower Shop and Tree Nursery, and selling food and drink to them in the Tavern. The more stars you have earned, the more items will be available to order in the shops, and the more visitors you will receive each day, giving you a better chance to earn more money.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFlowers - Earn Garden Points (GP) by filling the West Garden with flowers, plants and trees. These can be ordered in the Flower Shop and the Tree Nursery, your orders will arrive by train the following day. In order to place objects in the world you will need to discover the Neural Lace device, which is powered by the precious mineral gardenium, this can be obtained by mining in the caves.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFamily - King Theseus is all alone, but for a number of autonomous beings who run the shops and help service. Help him find his son Prince Felix by tracking down, and dealing with, the nefarious Bat King, whose presence is currently casting a dark shadow over the land.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrailer Music for Update 0.2.0.0: https://www.bensound.com/",
