    "description": "This is a puzzle game, in which you take tiles from a pile of mahjong tiles according to the rules.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnjoy level 1 to 100 puzzles with a unique definition of difficulty.<br />\r\nThe game gets more and more difficult as the number of tiles increases with each level!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnlike other games, there is no &quot;shuffle&quot; in this game.<br />\r\nThe reason for this is that the game is arranged in such a way that it can be solved by thinking, not by luck.<br />\r\nWe hope that you will use your failures as a food for thought and arrive at the right answers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n■The rules are very simple<br />\r\nWhen you select 2 identical tiles (*1) from a pile of mahjong tiles, you can obtain them.<br />\r\nThe objective of the game is to take all the tiles, and leaving some of them behind is a failure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are 2 rules for the tiles you can choose.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1. You cannot choose a tile that is sandwiched between other tiles on the left and right.<br />\r\n2. You cannot choose a tile with overlapping tiles on top of it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to these rules, the same tiles should be erased from each other.<br />\r\nDo not erase tiles at random, but choose them carefully.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInitially, the tiles that cannot be removed by default are marked with different colors.<br />\r\nOnce you have a good understanding of the rules, it is recommended to turn off this feature.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(*1) Seasonal and flower tiles are exceptions; the patterns do not have to be the same for the pair of both seasonal tiles or the pair of both flower tiles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n■Help Function<br />\r\n1. Clues (up to 3 times per level)<br />\r\nIf you can't find a tile to choose from, use this feature.<br />\r\nHowever, the clues only show the combinations of tiles that can be taken at that point in time, not necessarily the correct answer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2. Undo (up to 3 times per level)<br />\r\nWhen you make a mistake in erasing a tile, you can undo the operation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3. Selection assistance<br />\r\nIt changes the color of the unselectable tiles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4. Time display<br />\r\nYou can choose to display or not to display the time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n■Do you care about the time?<br />\r\nThe time it takes to solve this puzzle does not affect the progress of the game.<br />\r\nHowever, we use time as a guide to help you solve the puzzles.<br />\r\nIf you solve the same puzzle again, and your time is faster than before, you will be notified of your best time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf course, if you don't want to pay attention to the time, you can hide it from the settings.<br />\r\nYou can change it according to your own playing style.",
