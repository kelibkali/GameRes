    "description": "Sometimes solitude isn't a choice, and the past is hidden in a cruel twist of fate. <br><br>Brothers Apart is an action adventure RPG where the protagonist Leiyn has no recollection of his past. Adventure through the wilds with your wolf companion &quot;Monster&quot; and piece together the events that led you where you are. <br><br>Be ready to get pulled in by the 16 bit scenery, and a cast of characters that will keep you on your toes. Visit 4 different towns, cook, fish, eat, drink, and try not to fall victim to what hides in the woods... especially when night falls. Discover secret places, secret enemies, and try to collect 15 unique fish. Delve even deeper and you might discover where it all began.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Keep in mind that this is still in development and is getting better visually and functionally every day!
