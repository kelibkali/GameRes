    "description": "You are the protagonist of an unfinished 1st person fantasy game, trapped in 'development hell'. The designers (played by<strong> James Urbaniak</strong>, <strong>Ashly Burch</strong>, and <strong>Karen Dyer</strong>) are god-like, but so indecisive that they've given you no powers whatsoever. With the help of a mysterious disembodied voice (<strong>Stephen Russell</strong>) you must seize the tools of game development from these &quot;gods&quot; in order to explore and master the world, uncovering more of the darkly comic story as you go. Rather than traditional puzzles with a single solution, the incomplete state of each environment is a question that you answer in your own way. By trapping the designers' creations, stealing their behaviors, and re-mixing them to your own purposes - you will either ship the game from the inside ... or cancel it.",
