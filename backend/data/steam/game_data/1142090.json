    "description": "In a world of magic, run by idiots, there is the Lawless Sea. A place where piracy rules. Where the omnipresent Patriarchy has dominion in every country, but a growing Resistance is moving the upset the established order.<br><br>In this world a privateer named Eric will upset his girlfriend's mother, be transformed against his will, and made to join the Resistance. What will follow is a bizarre comedy of interesting circumstances and characters as chaos reigns. Will he/she embrace their new identity or oppose it? The choice is up to you!<br><br>Playing Both Sides is an RPGMaker game in the JRPG style. It features artwork lovingly crafted by an unemployed mathematician, and other much better artwork made by an actual artist. The game features mechanics and a combat system built by aforementioned mathematician, with a few nods to real life swordsmanship. What this games lacks in visuals, it makes up for in mechanics. Tactics will usually be the deciding factor in every fight.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Other features include:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Gender Bending<br></li><li>Witches<br></li><li>Pirates<br></li><li>Title IX Investigations<br></li><li>Trolls<br></li><li>Lessons on the safe use of explosives<br></li><li>Chosen Ones<br></li><li>Lots and lots of cats<br></li><li>Math<br></li><li>More Witches!<br></li><li>Pop culture references to things from before you were born<br></li><li>And fetch quests!</li></ul>",
