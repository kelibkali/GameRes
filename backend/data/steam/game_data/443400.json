    "description": "<strong>This DLC contains no extra in game material</strong>. Instead you get an art book with over 60 pages of concepts and illustrations that we have created during the making of <i>Medusa's Labyrinth</i>. Buying this DLC is also a way of supporting us, which would be very much appreciated and also sends a signal to publishers that people are willing to pay for this kind of game. Who knows? Maybe your contribution will help tip the scales in our favor.",
