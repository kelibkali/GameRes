As the Bot TOM and his companion robots BRI, RED, and STU defend Innovation Robotics, they encounter and rescue helpful robots called Robofriends. The Bots must embark on a rescue mission to save their home, save the Robofriends, and track down and defeat the sinister G.A.R.D captains who have taken over Innovation Robotics. <br><br>As you explore Innovation Robotics, you will find helpful robots called Robofriends.
