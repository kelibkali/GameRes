    "description": "<strong>Story</strong><br>Fifty years ago, the face of the Earth was permanently changed when it came into contact with a mysterious force known as the “Alpha Nebula.” As a result, humans developed various supernatural abilities and divided themselves based on those traits.<br>The main factions include: The Tonitrui, the Excedente, the Praecantator, the Permuto, and the Northmanni. Each has their own unique set of abilities that came with the collision – with the exception of the Northmanni, who remain largely unchanged. <br>Among these races, however, existed a special group of people who managed to retain all the other races’ abilities. They were a very powerful - but small and isolated group - known as “Emulators.” <br>Arin Arlento was one of these people, living in a remote village with his grandfather and other members of their race; everything was peaceful until the Northmanni Empire massacred the Emulators and kidnapped his childhood friend, Aria. <br>The only other survivor, Arin escaped into the Northmanni’s home continent of Rakos, hiding and plotting his revenge – that is, until he found out that Aria was still alive and was being experimented on. <br>Loathing the world that took everything away from him, Arin begins his quest to retrieve his friend and exact retribution on those who destroyed all that he held dear. <br>It’s one misguided man against the world…  <br><br><strong>About</strong><br>Betrayed, defeated, and left alone in the cruel wilderness, the story follows our protagonist, Arin Arlento, and his quest for retribution; one that questions friendship, revenge, and human nature itself. Surrounded by a cast of quirky heroines, the story features a selection of scenes which range from slice of life to heart-breaking sadness to nail-biting action.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br>Volume one features roughly 5-10 hours of play arising from a word count of more 150K+, more than 40 CGs and 20+ music tracks. The first volume contains the common route progressions through the tribes of Fulgur and Tribus, as well as Aniam and Alacria's routes.",
