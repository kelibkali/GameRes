They must face their past in order to move forward and unravel the mystery of what happened in Deckner.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is our first demo of the game, which contains the introduction, as well as the first level in the game, and we are aiming to have the complete game published in April of 2021!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you enjoyed our demo, or even played it all, we'd love to hear your feedback.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince this is very early on in development, we expect there to be bugs.
