In her arsenal was a very special living weapon. A murderous insane creature kept deep in the bowels of the castle. Captured by her father, Gloomer the Greatrat was rightly feared by all. In these ancient days lived mighty heroes such as Martin the Warrior and Gonff Prince of Mousethieves.<br><br><br>Now our would be champion, Gillig directed by the otter leader Skipper, has been given a very special solo mission.
