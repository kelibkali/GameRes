    "description": "Freeze climbing puts you into a surreal frozen dreamscape, where there's only one way to go: up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou're just a head and some hands, so to get around you'll need to climb. Freeze Climbing uses a novel locomotion system inspired by rock climbing. You must use your hands to pull yourself up, and throw yourself across gaps. WARNING: This method of movement can cause severe discomfort in some users, some anti-sickness settings are implemented, however user discretion is advised.",
