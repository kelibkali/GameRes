However, the challenges you'll face here are much less puzzle-like, and a lot more emergent and surprising—so your strategies will have to be as well. In this original turn based tactical war game, you take your army through a series of battles in which you’ve gotta capture the flags before taking too many losses!<br><br><i>Take tight, puzzle-like tactics in the vein of <i>Into the Breach</i> and <i>868-HACK</i>, add a big <i>Fire Emblem</i>-style overall package, and wrap the whole thing up in a nintendolicious candyflake aesthetic, and you have the new @keithburgun game, and it's great.</i> - Frank Lantz, Director of the NYU Game Center<br><br><i><i>Gem Wizards Tactics</i> is a whimsical and approachable turn-based tactical game, much like <i>Into the Breach</i>; 3 asymmetric factions, procedurally-generated maps and enemies, excellent synergies.

Better yet, there's cross-pollination between the factions, so maybe you can find some neat combo for your Azure Knights sliding over a bunch of freshly fracked oil slicks! Or, choose the Neverending Party, a raucous group of high-energy, hard-rockin' Skeletons!<br></li><li> Twenty-six unique unit types, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and unique special abilities!
