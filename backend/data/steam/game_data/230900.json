    "description": "Be warned, Succubus and Warlock! A new deliciously deadly duo enters the dungeon – one whose reflection you cannot see along with one you shouldn't ogle except in a mirror. The Vampire may seem like an easy target, but a word of advice: don’t snuggle with her undead poodle! And the Medusa has returned to Ardania with a vengeance. Rub her scales just right and she will silently slither up on your enemies and fill them with quarrels!",
