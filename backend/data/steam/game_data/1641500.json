    "description": "This game is a story-centered visual novel equal in length to a paperback novel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSynopsis:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the near future with the invention and adoption of the Electron Corneas, augmented reality is now the only reality humanity knows.<br />\r\nBut for Seejay, 'the blindness' has stripped him of his ability to exist in this new reality and has cut him off from the rest of the world.<br />\r\nOne day, as he is walking through this bustling city of monotony, moving through the crowds of people all dressed exactly the same...<br />\r\nSomething actually stands out—a girl dressed in a traditional school uniform from ages past…<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecome one of the blind as you live through this story with our protagonist and his classical-minded heroine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame features:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1) Updated and reworked for the Unity engine, this port of the 2017 mobile hit was met with praise throughout Korea for its romantic story and dystopian sci-fi themes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2) Written by the award-winning visual novel author Kil-ke (Winner of the Novel Engine free topic story award)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3) An emotional story and a rich soundtrack (6+ hours playtime, 100k word count): Your choices lead you to one of four endings. As such, there is no &quot;gameplay&quot; in the normal sense of the word.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4) Both female leads are fully-voiced by professional Korean voice actors (Mi Jang &amp; Yoomi Jeong)",
