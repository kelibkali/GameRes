The city of Seattle is hosting a gathering of the leaders of the World Trade Organization, one of the arms of American capitalist imperialism. You and your comrades have descended upon the city in order to intervene with some good old fashioned direct action. While many protested in peace, the police were ordered to silence all protestors with force. The political violence of the capitalist class must be met with a little political violence of our own!<br><br><strong>Battle For Seattle</strong> takes elements from classic arcade beat 'em ups and modern indie rougelites and combines them into an exciting anarcho-punk package! You play as an anarchist that must run through the streets of Seattle and smash symbols of capitalist exploitation in order to gain cultural capital while defending yourself from a violent and militarized police force. The game contains many items, secrets, characters, and endless gameplay to ensure thrilling replayability for hours!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><br><strong>5 Playable Charaters</strong> <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1295140/extras/820e67d4c0965e55a460311534a066cc.avif?t=1615223487\" width=616 height=155 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Spend your cultural capital to unlock and play as one of five unique characters each with their own ability and playstyle!</li></ul><br><strong>3 Different Neighbourhoods</strong><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1295140/extras/1b2ad2a7c38135ef337e4df108ebdbc1.avif?t=1615223487\" width=616 height=100 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Run through the grungy streets of Seattle as you experience the class divisions of modern America and play through endless levels!</li></ul><br><strong>10+ Items and Ugpgrades</strong><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1295140/extras/60b0151c150479f8c3c824b71fb3ef86.avif?t=1615223487\" width=616 height=121 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Purchase items and discover secret items to increase your strength and abilities!</li></ul>",
