    "description": "Travel trugh space with a big laser gun, and lot of wacky enemies and obstacles. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nJobous the alien R is an addictive space shooter with a cute alien named Jobous. its just like an old-school arcade space shooter , but with an insane difficulty. <br />\r\nthe goal of the game is to get from point A to point B without crashing in anything or anyone. luckily its many power ups to help you stay alive. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is the type of game you will never complete. It is so hard that not only will your hand sweat. It will also fall off in the process<br />\r\n. you will cry for your mother and praying to god, just to complete one level. Are you up for the challenge? <br />\r\n<br />\r\n(in other words a rage game) <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSTORY:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story is sweet and simple. Jobous and his wife is living the dream in outer space. When suddenly ( dramatic music ) his wife want some new shoes. Oh no she is going to use all their space money (jup she is kinda a money spender). Jobous <br />\r\n<br />\r\nImmediately panics. What should he do? Jobous takes his ship and travel after her. Can he save his wife from spending all their space money on shoes?",
