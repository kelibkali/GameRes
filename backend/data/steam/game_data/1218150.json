    "description": "Love is such a silly feeling. Can you really live for it? Why would you die for it? Empty words... But what if someone's life can really depend on your love?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis story isn't just about the world, that suddenly turned into a dream. It will also make you decide fates of others as well as your own. So be careful, because every step you'll take, every choice you'll make may become the one to turn this dreamland into a real nightmare.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- 4 possible romantic interests (or maybe you'll still prefer to be friends? The choice is yours!);<br />\r\n- 20~ beautiful CG;<br />\r\n- nice music and colourful backgrounds.",
