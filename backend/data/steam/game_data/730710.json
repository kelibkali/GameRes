Our badass energy axes and special abilities are similar to popular MOBA mechanics<br><br>Choose 1 of 4 Space Vikings, raid other dimensions and engage thousands of aliens in intense futuristic combat. Launch your destructive onslaught with 10 devastating abilities that will obliterate enemies and landscapes alike. Use brute force and aggression to smash through enemy waves or pick your moment and strike with tactical precision. Once you’ve vaporized all foes in your path you must destroy the enemy base with it’s spawners, energy shields and defensive turrets. In the center of each base, the “heart building”, destroy it, the base crumbles and you’ll claim it’s precious Elementium. <br><br>Play online or locally with up to 4 people. Take advantage of different play styles and abilities using complimentary weapon systems to line up the best combos. When you and your fellow raiders run out of Energy, you’ll have to maneuver and melee, timing your attacks just right to keep the enemies at bay. Navigating the alien worlds will be a perilous venture and require careful platforming skills. As you move through canyons, over archipelagos and across the sugary desserts, you’ll have to bounce over cliffs, carefully maneuver moving platforms and avoid destroying the very ground under your feet.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/730710/extras/96632f368d1fa4e2837ff0ae0552c1d9.avif?t=1549826012\" width=600 height=391 /></span><br><br>The 10 level campaign you will play through follows the story of legendary Space Viking Raider, Dredrick ‘Deadeyes’ and his ruthless and irreverent crew of Space Viking misfits. Nakano ‘Zica’ Zicarus, the audacious munitions expert and technical prodigy. Tommy K., the crew’s resident Berserker, brain damaged, and suffering from frequent bouts of memory loss and psychedelia. And Athelia, the crew’s 2nd in command and pilot, her competence and measured personality paired with a fierce loyalty to Dredrick. After raiding a science vessel and looting inter-dimensional portalling technology they begin raiding alien worlds. The arid canyons of the sluglings. The lush archipelago of the Federites. And the sugary desserts of the Sugarfiends. <br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/730710/extras/ec6f43dab5ef256ae3caec8f4f1bdfcd.avif?t=1549826012\" width=600 height=169 /></span><br><br>We play on hard.<br><br>Based in Vancouver, Multiball Studios was created by Adam Thompson and Scott Banducci. Using their complementary skill sets and funded with their own money, they set out to build an indie game studio from the ground up. <br><br>Despite having minimal time and resources, Multiball was able attract some of the best talent from Vancouver's rich game and film ecosystem. Sound engineers from feature film productions, artists from AAA gaming studios and modelers and animators from the indie game scene. Using a network of connections locally in Vancouver and from around the world they've pulled in music and voice acting from places like New Zealand and Scotland.<br><br>The idea we believe in is both simple and difficult: the best way to become a successful indie game studio is to start making games. If our games are good, the money will flow. With veteran lead developer Adam Thompson at the helm we expect this first game will demonstrate the tremendous potential of Multiball Studios creativity and network of talented individuals.",
