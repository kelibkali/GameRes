    "description": "Making food on Earth is so complicated and boring; who has time for that? On this planet, you can pull it straight from the ground! All your favorite foods - pizza, tacos, cake - are ripe for the plucking. Collect them and build stores to sell them (what an original concept!). As you search more of the planet, you'll eventually come across more 'exotic' foods that you can collect and sell for more money! Smash passing 'food comets' for a little boost. And one last thing, don't miss out on the key step to making money here: spin the planet! If a planet spins faster things happen faster, right?, so you make more money! Now get eating!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a solo developed game, so there will likely be bugs or hang-ups. If you encounter any bugs or have any suggestions, use the 'Report Bug' button in game or contact the support email and let me know!",
