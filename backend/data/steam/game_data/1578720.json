You can explore the world in whatever direction you want, but may be blocked from some pathways until you learn a new spell to help you get by. Or you can just turn around and head somewhere else first instead! Nearly all spells, bosses, and regions of the game can be found in any order.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >While exploring, you’ll come across tons of hidden secrets and challenges, characters with their own storylines to progress, mysteries about the world to slowly piece together, and endless things to study and write about in your academy notebook.
