    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Legendary Villains: Dark Druids</h2><strong> When the Woods are Wild and Wicked, Beware!</strong><br>Druids have long been an afterthought in RPGs, relegated to the sidelines of adventure as harmless hermits or tree-hugging environmentalists.<br><strong> NO LONGER!</strong> Though little noticed, evil alignments have been open to druids since the dawn of 3rd Edition, and in a wilderness-based campaign they make magnificent and malevolent menaces. This product discusses the role of druids as villains and introduces the concept of the Umbral Wood, a transplanar wilderness that reaches across the Shadow Plane, the Fey Realms, and into the Material Plane. Deep in the heart of this blackest forest lies the realm of the Midnight Master, a debauched and debased deity that embodies every awful possibility that might darken the heart of a corrupted warden of the wilderness. What follows is a collection of archetypes, richly detailed and thematic feats, and druid spells. With over 30 new rules elements, including spells like<br><i> bloodspear, drought,</i> and<br><i> nightwing host</i> and feats like Tidalwave of Rot and Unhallowed Shade of the Umbral Wood, alongside the Darkwolf and Unseelie Ovate druid archetypes, this 26-page sourcebook offers a bevy of options for making your druids dangerous and deadly!<br><i> Converted by:</i>  <br><strong> Connor Bates</strong><br><strong> Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included Pathfinder RPG and D&amp;D 3.5/ OGL ruleset. Compatible with Fantasy Grounds Unity",
