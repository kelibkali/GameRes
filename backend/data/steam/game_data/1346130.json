We've put over 150 Killer Queen machines into arcades, bars, and rec rooms across the country, with millions of games played. Our games are all about physically bringing people together, face to face—which at the present moment, is obviously not possible.<br><br>When COVID-19 started sweeping across the globe, the arcade scene was (and continues to be) heavily impacted by the closing of bars/arcades and the implementation of social distancing. This left both our company and the <i>Killer Queen</i> community in a rough spot, so we set out to create something unique that would help bring our players closer together while we all navigate the difficulties of quarantined life.<br><br>That's how we came up with <strong><i>ZOMBEEZ: A Killer Queen Remix</i></strong>, the fast-paced, high-flying, single-player 2D platformer based in the Killer Queen universe. We hope you enjoy our first single-player <i>Killer Queen</i> adventure!",
