Instead of pushing blocks, throw them - and yourself - across entire levels, and stack them vertically to open new routes. Instead of fearing death, embrace it by killing your character to respawn her in better locations. Many more hazards and contraptions await, to be dodged or turned to your advantage.<br> <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449570/extras/890820eda7b7967585102a253b762e06.poster.avif?t=1641520693\" width=640 height=360 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449570/extras/890820eda7b7967585102a253b762e06.webm?t=1641520693\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449570/extras/890820eda7b7967585102a253b762e06.mp4?t=1641520693\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br> <br>You will play as Emm, a newly-dead soul who is greeted by God himself. God's plans conflict with Emm's independence, and she swiftly collects enemies.
