Discover the secrets, situations, and people that await you in this surreal universe while trying to deal with the guilt and grief caused by the disturbing unforgettable past. <br><br>This game talks about serious issues such as guilt, grief, trauma, drug abuse and suicidal thoughts in a new and different way that will hopefully be interpreted better by the new generation. This game is also personal to me. It is a small universe I created to make my zone-out thoughts and stories a reality.  <br><br><br><br><strong>Story:</strong><br>In Introvert: Consequences, you are one of the four survivors of a tragic school shooting accident in your hometown. You all leave town and the past behind in hopes of moving on and letting go.

All while trying to deal with the guilt and grief caused by the painful past. The city is full of secrets and places ready to be explored. Pretty simple.<br><br><strong>About me:</strong><br>I am Faris, one of the Euphoric Brothers. Addicted to overthinking, lo-fi, and making video games, I decided to merge all three hobbies into one project, thus, Introvert: Consequences was born after Introvert: A Teenager Simulator. I have developed this game completely by myself except for some audio and songs. Oh, and I am also 19 and a first-year university student. After releasing a lot of failed commercial games, I realized that I don’t care about money and that what I really want is to create my own universe and community 😊.",
