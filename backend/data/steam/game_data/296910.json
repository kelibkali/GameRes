Then he suddenly remembers all the good times he had as a kid, playing his trusted 8-bit console. Deep down in the far and darkest corner of the basement he finds it along with a strange looking cartridge. He plugs in the cartridge right away, and get sucked into a vivid, but decaying world of platforming. And this is where your adventure takes off. <br><br>8BitBoy is the platformer I always dreamt about playing as a kid. <br><br>It's a fantastic mash-up of the greatest of the late 80's and 90's and a complete game on it's own terms. This is a true tribute to old school gaming and by no means a walk in the park, but it's also never unfair. With big challenges, the sense of accomplishment is always bigger and better. <br><br>To me, 8BitBoy is the ultimate classic platformer on PC and Mac. and a symbol of my love and passion for gaming. <br><br>Yours Sincerely,<br>Rasmus Kønig Sørensen<br>Indie developer and sole creator of 8BitBoy<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/296910/extras/657c8f15f27392c7a09d1deab43ad105.avif?t=1621505818\" width=614 height=90 /></span>",
