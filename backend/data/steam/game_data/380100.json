And even primary school teachers without a musical background can use it in the classroom. It's the result of a worldwide awarded project, which was developed with the collaboration of over 200 primary school students.<br><br><br>Q: Why is it called <i>Flute</i> Master if it teaches the recorder?<br>A: In some European countries - namely Portugal, where Classplash was born - &quot;flute&quot; (<i>flauta</i>) refers to the recorder flute. Only when talking about other flutes do we specify the type of flute (ex: transverse flute). This felt easier to understand for some non-english languages. In addition, &quot;Recorder Master&quot; was taken. ;)",
