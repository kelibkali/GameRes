You try to look around and get your barring, but can only see the inky blackness of the void surrounding you. The holes where your eyes should be begin to tear, as you scream out for help. Will you be able to escape and solve the mystery, or will you be doomed to join the other's fate?<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2074540/extras/c64ed43b24a35c94373782e9804f0c0d.avif?t=1668651603\" width=800 height=80 /></span><br>Ocular Deprivation is a game (go figure) where you, the character, are blind. You need to make it through a labyrinth that you captors have put you in through the use of echolocation-type seeing. Move through the labyrinth that you have mysteriously found yourself in, and attempt to unravel the mysteries hidden throughout it.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2074540/extras/bdfb5bf393b7bf3c31cc792d01917877.avif?t=1668651603\" width=800 height=80 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2074540/extras/325d804d5260ecc4a140a9ee32bf05d9.avif?t=1668651603\" width=432 height=126 /></span><br>Ocular Deprivation provides a unique gameplay experience, in that YOU, you as in you the person not the player, are able to see all sound produced in the game through balls that appear at the origin. These balls then proceed to bounce off every wall and surface, allowing you to understand and get your bearings.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2074540/extras/240901064ff3f17975e51820a01a8dca.avif?t=1668651603\" width=800 height=160 /></span><br>While this may seem beneficial on the surface, they may just lead to you downfall. The reasoning for this being enemies may just be attracted to the origins of these sounds, meaning you have to choose, either get complete understanding of your environment and lure your captors towards you, or stay hidden in the shadows, but not know what surrounds you.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2074540/extras/46a992f75f4d18a0eb068d372e133645.avif?t=1668651603\" width=800 height=160 /></span>",
