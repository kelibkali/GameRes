    "description": "The main aim is to survive until a chopper with the rescue team arrives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe gameplay: the player shall monitor the health indices; look for the items like food, water, medications, burner gas in the possessions other fishermen left behind. These items will help him last for another several hours.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe player’s dreams will feature the challenges, determining his spirit and state of mind. The worse the latter are, the tougher it is for the player to survive, while the challenges will become more and more complicated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe events unfold in the abnormal weather conditions, the temperature can drop unexpectedly, putting the protagonist’s life at risk – if he is far from the tent, it would be difficult to come back in poor visibility conditions and survive the extreme cold.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are also other risks, for instance, slipping during running or jumping, causing an injury preventing the protagonist from providing for himself, and, consequently causing his death.",
