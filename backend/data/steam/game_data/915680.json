There was Clark — once a farmer, now a jaded husband, and future bounty hunter of <i>The Hive Pandemic</i>. After losing everything to a tornado and a divorce, Clark becomes one of the first human colonists on Mars.

All characters, organizations, and corporations—especially &quot;X-Corp&quot;—are fictional and were developed as part of an original sci-fi universe prior to the formation of any real-world entities with similar names.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Any resemblance to actual persons, corporations, or organizations is purely coincidental. No association is intended or implied.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >In Memory of Clark Andrews</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Lead Artist, Musician, Friend, and the Soul of this Game</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Jaws of Hell</strong> was born from tragedy. My dear friend, bandmate, and creative partner Clark Andrews took his own life after a long battle with alcoholism and heartbreak. His fingerprints are on everything I make—from the way the colors burn, to the sound of chaos in silence. This game is named for him, his struggles as well as my own. Clark Andrews, the artist is now Clark the mechanical engineer. His pain, his fire, his humor, his flaws—they live in this story. My own struggle with alcoholism and the impact it had on my wife Angela and our family is also woven into this story. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >If you are reading this and feel like the darkness is swallowing you whole, please know: <strong>you are not alone</strong>. There are people who love you, even if it doesn’t feel that way right now. <strong>You matter.</strong> Drinking isn’t the way out, and neither is ending your life. There is help, there is hope, and there is a tomorrow where you are still here and still creating something meaningful—just like Clark did, and I continue to aspire to.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >If you or someone you love is struggling, please reach out to a mental health professional or a crisis line. Or take the time to be there for each other. You're not weak for asking for help—<strong>you’re brave</strong>. If you know someone in need make a phone call to a friend or family that is struggling, words really do have an impact.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >*The relationship between Clark and Angela is based on what happened between my wife, Angela, and myself while I struggled with drinking. I don't know everything that happened between Clark and his wife. I asked my wife if it was okay if I used our past as a reference. I have been sober for almost 3 years at the release of this and the game is very much about my struggles with suicide, longing for connection and peace as much as what I assume Clark's struggles were based on our talks. Grief is overwhelming and I know this is a strange way to express it. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >*Also this game has been approved by Steam for years, I keep working on it, changing it, expanding it but I could not bring myself to release it until now.</p></li></ul>",
