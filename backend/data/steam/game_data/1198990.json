Hans Heimer in his own personal vendetta against &quot;the system&quot;.<br><br>The current demo features the first 25 turns of the Campaign (or the first 5 conquered provinces) with the full dialogs, events, research, etc. It also provides unlimited access to the first 5 maps of the arcade mode, including our famous &quot;Map 26&quot;, where you can briefly test the full game features (abilities, towers, buildings, units, etc).<br>The demo is taken out of a pre-release beta, so while it has been undergoing now more than 400 hours of total testing, it's still possible to find some bugs of issues. In that case, don't hesitate to use the ingame tool to report them!<br><br>If you like it, don't forget to wishslist it, it's coming soon!<br><br><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Plot driven campaign - betrayals, diplomacy and nasty twists<br></li><li>Turn based strategy - quell the rebellion, kick back the enemy and restore the law.<br></li><li>Empire management - conquer back the provinces, strengthen your command, chose your best governors and grant your military campaign a steady flow of resources<br></li><li>Arcade play mode. Because... FIGHT!<br></li><li>Tower defense-based combat - fight your battles in a new, advanced tower defense style that winks at advanced real time strategy<br></li><li>Dark humor, dark humor everywhere! - Don't smile, it's punishable.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1198990/extras/ZepCrash.gif?t=1616693831\" /></span>",
