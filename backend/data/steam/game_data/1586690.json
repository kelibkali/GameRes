    "description": "The ULF (short for Ultra-Low-Floor) is the first generation of low-floor trams in Vienna's tram network and has been in operation since 1995. The special features of this vehicle type are the unique design of the vehicle with axle-free bogies and one of the lowest boarding heights worldwide for tram vehicles. <br><br>The low-floor articulated railcars are used in two different vehicle lengths. They are called &quot;ULF-A&quot; in the short version with 5 sections and &quot;ULF-B&quot; in the long version with 7 sections. <br><br>The running gear arrangement of both &quot;ULF types&quot; consists of pairs of independent wheels with independent suspension, which form a unit in a so-called running or drive portal (LP or AP). Together with the front, passenger and rear modules, these gantries form the respective vehicle type.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1586690/extras/c828af511731150f5920b553be5417d3.avif?t=1646649140\" width=600 height=114 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>New vehicle generation Type ULF<br>- Long version (7 parts) Type B<br>- Short version (5 parts) Type A<br></li><li>Vehicle details<br>- Repaintable<br>- Authentic sound backdrop<br>- Realistic driving behaviour<br>- Complex animations and many details<br>- Complete set-up and dismantling procedure<br>- Driver's cab operable with key, BAWS<br>- Windows operable, air intakes as on the original<br>- Extended IBIS functions<br></li><li>Use in AI traffic<br>- ULF A and B in circulation on AI lines for Vienna map </li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1586690/extras/b77de00b8a4c480f8e97947f0cd91597.avif?t=1646649140\" width=600 height=848 /></span>",
