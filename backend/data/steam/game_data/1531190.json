    "description": "Paper Glider is a construction-paper-styled game in which you control a gliding paper triangle through a series of 70 colorful levels. The controls are simple but difficult to master, leading to a challenging and rewarding gameplay experience. Learn to master your momentum to complete all 7 worlds!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe goal is simple: reach the end of each level. As you progress through Paper Glider's 7 worlds, this task becomes increasingly difficult. From avoiding objects with gravitational pulls and dodging past projectiles, to teleporting around levels and cloning yourself, there are many different challenges and features to discover on your journey to complete each world!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlong with 70 unique levels to play through, you are also able to view various stats about your gameplay. Find out how many times you have died on each level and how long it took you to beat them. Track your fastest times or your slowest, and which levels you have died on the most. There are all kinds of statistics to see!",
