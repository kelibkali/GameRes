    "description": "DawnWander is a cold and dark shooter about the survival of a nameless soldier in a rough winter. There is no room for weakness, fear, and doubt. You are a wild animal in the wild environment. Your basic instinct is to survive at any cost under any circumstance, to adapt to the harsh tests of the environment. Your enemies are bone-chilling cold, enemy manpower, and wilderness. Your constant companions are hunger, thirst, fatigue, and illness. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGet animal meat, kill lost enemies to rob their corpses, look for supplies left in the ruins of a military performance. There are no standards of morality and ethics here. There are no friends here, and any person you meet will shoot a bullet in your forehead without hesitation...",
