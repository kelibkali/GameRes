Draft an odd squad of warriors, with names like Kittyclops, Pompaduck and Killgor the Conqueror. Each card has its own preposterous powers, so you'll need strategy -and a bit of luck of the dice -to survive! Knock out the competition and become the beastie boss! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > <br>Based on the hilarious, critically-acclaimed card-battling game. Battle bizarre and ridiculous cards in both single-player and online PVP multiplayer modes. Rumble against a horde of odd opponents created just for the videogame, such as Tutufly, Picklepuss and Beatknock. Easy to learn how to play... but with wild and varied strategies to keep play interesting for up to 92 years, 163 days, 8 hours and 22 minutes! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449620/extras/1d37e54bfc8d1e1c19304c1efce06340.poster.avif?t=1764522319\" width=616 height=352 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449620/extras/1d37e54bfc8d1e1c19304c1efce06340.webm?t=1764522319\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449620/extras/1d37e54bfc8d1e1c19304c1efce06340.mp4?t=1764522319\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >SQUIRMISH IS NOT JUST WEIRD FUNNY, AND NOT JUST HA-HA FUNNY, IT IS SNORT-HYUK-GUFFAW-MILK-SHOOTING-OUT-OF-YOUR-NOSE FUNNY</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Squirmish has more crazy cartoon buffoons than you can fit in a clown-car, with some of them shouting their insane battle cries, others chattering incessantly about all sorts of obscure nonsense, and some just hypnotically wiggling their sausage-arms, seemingly summoning a chortle from deep in your guts.
