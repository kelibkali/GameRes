    "description": "Expand your Steel Division 2 experience with this free Reinforcement Pack, which features the new Rules of Engagement mechanic. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new Rules of Engagement allows you to set your units’ default behavior when executing certain types of orders, reducing the amount of player micromanagement and improving accessibility. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe feature is displayed as an add-on to the standard Steel Division 2 tactical user interface and can be used in every game mode, including in solo, coop and multiplayer. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Rules of Engagement mechanic is an in-depth new feature that further expands the control you have over your units on the battlefield, telling them exactly how to behave when moving, what to do when idle, or when to engage enemy targets. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Rules of Engagement update can be used by both new players and veterans alike. If you wish to opt-out of his mechanic, switching off Rules of Engagement can be done in the Steel Division 2 options. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Rules of Engagement feature comes as part of a free Reinforcement Pack, available to all owners of Steel Division 2.",
