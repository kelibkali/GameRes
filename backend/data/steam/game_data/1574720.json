    "description": "<strong>Diorama Tower Defense: Tiny Kingdom</strong> (Prologue) is a cute tower defense game with currently three different dioramas (tiny rooms), as well as three difficulty levels.<br><br>Your task is to stop the enchanted fantasy creatures like elves, goblins, trolls, rainbow unicorns and so on from reaching the king of the little kingdom, King Arthur, because he is allergic to those cute creatures. Because the evil witch Samira has turned the creatures into sugar-sweet beings. Now strategically build towers on the playing fields to fend off the hordes.<br><br>You have the following towers at your disposal for defense: <strong>Archer Tower, Cannon Tower, Fire Tower, Ice Tower, Ballista and Poison Tower</strong>. You can also upgrade them further. By neutralizing enemies you can earn money to buy more towers or upgrade them as you wish. You also have the power to manipulate time, so you can rewind time but also make it move faster, thanks to Merlin.<br><br><strong>Join our Discord</strong> server and follow the further development of Diorama TD. <strong>Have a lot of fun!!!</strong>",
