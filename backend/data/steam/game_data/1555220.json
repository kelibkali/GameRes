What we plan to represent:<br><br>- Ailments: breaking bones, altered stances from injury, scars, disease, sickness, and even paralysis. Your creatures survival story, their fights and struggles, will be told through the visible wounds and tattered conditions.<br>- AI: realistic creatures with complex behaviours able to be hunted.<br>- Mod Support: steam workshop will allow for custom maps, settings, creatures etc.<br>- Snatching: birds of prey will be able to snatch the small young of other animals.<br>- Destructible environment: you will be able to interact with the land around you and alter it within reason.<br>- Adding more feature packs for other eco systems such as Safari, Ocean, Jungle etc.<br><br>This is our current list for planned updates, this is up for expansion and alternating as time continues. Feedback is a necessity, community input will be needed for Artemishea's wonderful transformation.",
