    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Ripped From Time: Outpost</strong> is a first-person, drone-led strategy RPG set on a Dyson ring surrounding a contained rupture in space-time. It’s only one fracture among many—and while this one is stable for now, the larger rupture crisis is accelerating. Left unresolved, this breach will become another catastrophe.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You arrive at a functioning outpost and decide how it evolves. Expand the base with the structures you choose, build out production chains, and advance from stone tools to laser-era technology through crafting and research. Recruit and command historical figures pulled through the anomaly—each with stats and personality-driven traits that shape roles and squad synergy—and direct them in real time while you remain on the front line through your drone’s camera.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Your drone’s gun is both weapon and tool. Toggle it to fight hostile enemies and to power towers and devices that keep the outpost operational and push your capabilities forward. Build the economy, hold the perimeter, and assemble the terrain-scale energy systems required to seal the breach—before the wider rupture crisis catches up.</p>",
