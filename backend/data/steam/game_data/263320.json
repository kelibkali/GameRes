    "description": "<i>Saturday Morning RPG</i> is an episodic JRPG set in world heavily inspired by 1980s Saturday morning cartoons and pop culture. Players take the role of Martin &quot;Marty&quot; Michael Hall, an average high-school student who has just been granted an incredible power - a power that ultimately leads him to attract the ire of the world's most notorious villain, Commander Hood! <i>Saturday Morning RPG</i> features a full soundtrack by legendary composer Vince DiCola (<i>Transformers: The Animated Movie</i>, <i>Rocky IV</i>) and his composing partner, Kenny Meriedeth (contributor for <i>DuckTales</i>, <i>Power Rangers</i>, <i>X-Men</i>, and others).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>TECH SPECS:</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Episodic Gameplay: </strong>The story and gameplay of <i>Saturday Morning RPG</i> takes place across several episodes, each of which tells a complete self-contained story. Players can play any episode in any order, at any time! All of your stats and items carry between episodes. It’s a unique spin on the tried and true New Game Plus mode. On top of that, small decisions made in some episodes will carry forth into others – adding a layer of replay to each episode. Five episodes are included!<br><br></li><li><strong>Active Turn-Based Combat:</strong> <i>Saturday Morning RPG</i> draws quite a bit of inspiration from games like Nintendo’s <i>Paper Mario</i> series. Battles in the game are turn-based, but the player is always participating by actively defending against attacks and completing reflex tests to power up their own assaults.<br><br></li><li><strong>Defeat Enemies With Regular Stuff:</strong> Marty fights all his battles in the game by channeling magic through everyday objects. Use a pack of striped gum to summon rainbow zebras that trample your foes – or call upon a transforming action figure to morph you into a semi-truck!<br><br></li><li><strong>Nostalgia Fueled Everything:</strong> Everything in <i>Saturday Morning RPG</i> centers on nostalgia. Marty receives his magical abilities thanks to a certain kind of garish plastic notebook, he can equip scratch ‘n sniff stickers to get statistical boosts, and he’ll traverse worlds inspired by the entire gamut of Saturday morning cartoons. <br><br></li><li><strong>Endless Battle Mode: </strong>Take on wave after wave of enemies in an endless survival mode where resource management becomes everything!<br><br></li><li><strong>Optional Arena Battles: </strong>Take on powerful enemies in optional arena battles. Two fights are currently included, with more coming as free updates.<br><br></li><li><strong>Controller Support: </strong>Full support for game controllers.<br><br></li><li><strong>Steam Achievements and Trading Cards: </strong>Earn over 70 achievements and collect 8 trading cards. </li></ul>",
