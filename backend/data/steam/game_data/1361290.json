    "description": "<strong>SPLASH KING'S TOURNAMENT</strong><br>- Is an <strong>Exhilarating </strong>fast paced tournament style multiplayer third person shooter, where the last player standing wins the match. <strong>(!Battle Royale!) </strong><br><br>Select one of <strong>Ten Fun Characters</strong> to choose from, then choose betwen <strong>Quick Match</strong> mode where you only play one match, or <strong>Tournament</strong> mode where you can create or join tournaments consisting of at least 3 matches played consecutively. You can <strong>Create Private Rooms</strong> for you and your friends, or join/create an open room for anyone to join.<br><br>When everyone is ready and done using the <strong>Chat</strong> while they wait for everyone to join, you hit the &quot;Start Match&quot; button and the <strong>HEAT IS ON</strong>!!! <br><br>You spawn into one of <strong>Ten Beautiful Levels Teeming With Wildlife</strong> in an inviting closed off segment of the ocean just begging for you to jump in and <strong>SPLASH, THRASH, FRAG, DASH</strong> and... <strong>SPLASH!</strong><br>On your back, you carry an engine like a backpack that allows you to propel yourself under water at <strong>Three Different Speeds</strong>. If you build up enough momentum, you can breach the surface of the sea and <strong>Fly For a Short Period of Time</strong>, aded by your engines <strong>Air-Booster</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1361290/extras/da32d7ed1e23963db546ebda1caa9a17.avif?t=1684277675\" width=640 height=360 /></span><br><br>You are now flying high above the surface of the sea where you have the best lay of the land, your enemies and the <strong>Upgrade Crates</strong> that spawn in the air. Shoot your enemies with your handy standard weapon that never runs out of ammo but deals low damage, or fly into an upgrade crate and hope to get the <strong>Homing Missile</strong> or the <strong>RAIL GUN</strong> for example. <strong>But BEWARE</strong>... not all crates contain an upgrade you'll want or need and you never know what you're going to get! Along with this random variable, the fast paced action packed is accentuated further when you <strong>Hear the Horns Blow</strong> after a while. For when the horns sound, the walls making up the contours of each level close in, making the available space to live and thrash, smaller and smaller...<br><br>With <strong>5 Lives per Match</strong>, it's imperative that you remain within the confines of the walls. If you fall outside the walls, <strong>Your Engine Explodes</strong>, you loose all 5 lives instantly and will be relegated to watch your friends finish the match from the outside until you <strong>Re-spawn in the Next Level</strong>. For you, the walls closing in, are a blessing in disguise. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>*Note: If the Desktop Icon appears blurry, follow these steps:<br><br>Right click on the blurry icon on your desktop and choose Properties<br><br>Look for the button &quot;Change Icons&quot; in the &quot;Web Document&quot; fan<br><br>Then click &quot;Browse&quot; and select the game in your Steam Library folder<br><br>Your icon should now not be blurry anymore",
