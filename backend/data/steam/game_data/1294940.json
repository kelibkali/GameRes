    "description": "The command gave the task of downloading information from the servers of the impregnable enemy base at any cost. How to do it? First you need a good plan. You need to be as close as possible to the borders of the enemy and to land in a safe place. Turn off the air defense system and call for reinforcements. Together with reinforcements, you will need to capture the command post and download information from the server. Then leave the enemy territory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn each segment of the path there will be traps and obstacles, strong points of the enemy. Using different weapons you need to complete tasks.",
