    "description": "<strong>27.08.2014</strong><br><br>What if I could invent a way to change identities, becoming a different person almost instantly, choosing a new self, as though from a catalogue? Just pop a pill—and new identities emerge in your memories, as though you were looking into the future rather than the past. They would stay on your mind, swapping and switching, until you make a choice. Then you pop one more pill, and the future you like, the future of your choice, becomes your present in a couple of nights. Another thing required would be a program capable of scanning the subconscious and recording everything that happens there. All you would have to do for it to work is lock yourself in a small room to produce a dense aura—required to transfer data from the subconscious to the program. Think about it: it only takes two things, a program to scan the subconscious and a pill to activate the identity changing process. Two things pave the way to my dream. What would happen if I did create such things…?<br><br><strong>10.11.2014</strong><br><br>Information about our future selves, our identities, and what life holds in store is hidden away in the depths of our subconscious mind. We have to spend our entire lives trying to drag just a single one of these up to the surface of our consciousness. Is this really fair? Ready-made identities—musicians, actors, athletes, writers—they’re all alive and well in our subconscious. All we have to do is play a little trick on nature so they pop up on command; so we can become the person we’ve been dreaming of. How much happier would we be? How much more could we manage to do and experience in our short lives? Aren’t we all just looking for the meaning of life?<br><br><strong>13.04.2015</strong><br><br>A thought is a living organism. It might at first seem disordered and absurd, but our mind organizes it and gives it meaning. But this process only happens in our conscience mind; we remain forever cut off from our subconscious thoughts. To read them we need the Writer. He converts thoughts into text, writes the story of the subconscious mind and helps people touch and interact with it. <br>When you destroy a living organism, the soul departs from it. With a thought, it is a sound. The death cries of thoughts tell us their story of what is happening in the subconscious.<br><br><strong>26.12.2015</strong><br><br>If you’re reading these words, I’m no longer alive. Everything changed when I invented the Writer—I could never have imagined what worlds would be revealed by my subconscious. In the blink of an eye I could decide my fate, choose who I would be today, tomorrow, in a week. If you’ve received this letter, then I’ve dared make this final step. I have no idea if you should be congratulating or pitying me. I can never know what has become of me, but you can.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Use the Writer program to see what happened in the subconscious during the identity change.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You collect the texts of stories, just the way you collect thoughts in your head.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>It is only when you have read all 4 stories, and compared them with the diary of the experiment, that you will understand what has happened to me.</li></ul><br>The thoughts are locked away in the story and it is only you that can set them free, give them meaning. The story of the subconscious is in your hands.",
