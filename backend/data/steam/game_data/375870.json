    "description": "In some platformers you die a lot. Not because you are being killed by things you could not possibly know - you perfectly know what's what but you still can't pull off the moves. In some platformers you spend 10 minutes on a level that can be passed in under 15 seconds. <br />\r\nYou might look at SLIDE's  footage and think that it's an easy game. But you would be wrong.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSLIDE is a hardcore 2d platformer where you run, jump and (often) die. No enemies, no blowing stuff up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat makes this game stand out - for better or worse - is a system of contextual jumps which allows to perform dozens of jumps simply by combining direction keys with the &quot;jump&quot;. You can even jump down.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis feature not only makes for a unique paltforming experience but also adds a puzzle element where you need to figure out what jumps are available to you and which ones to perform in certain situations.",
