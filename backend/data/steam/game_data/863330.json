As its name suggests, it contains everything necessary for doing so, all packaged together &quot;in a box&quot;. The software is designed with a fun, beginner-friendly approach in mind as to not require any programming or modelling knowledge, while still providing a wide range of customization and openness. You can export your game to a standalone format for Windows and MacOS, allowing others to play it without needing to own RPG in a Box!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/863330/extras/current_features_en.png?t=1766026499\" /></span><br>While <strong>RPG in a Box</strong> is constantly being expanded with new features and functionality, you can refer to the list below for a general, high-level look at what's currently possible in the engine.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Voxel Editor</h2>Build tiles, objects, and characters from 3D pixel blocks (i.e. voxels) and easily animate them with the editor's frame-based, stop-motion animation system.
