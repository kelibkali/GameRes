He’s grown from a tiny sprocket to a full grown machine and I couldn’t be happier. But those propellerheads at DroneCorp don’t like it one bit, a monopoly on artificial smarts is what they got. Now they’re comin’ to dismantle the lil feller, but i just can’t let em’ do that. With Scrappy buildin’ weapons and traps, all I gotta do is shoot em’. I can blast a gnat off a squirrel’s butt from 100 feet away, so I reckon a couple of big old drones will be no fuss at all.”</i><br><br>Home A Drone is a <strong>Tower Defense</strong>-inspired <strong>VR FPS</strong>, where you use skill and strategy to defeat the DroneCorp menace who threatens to take away what you love.
