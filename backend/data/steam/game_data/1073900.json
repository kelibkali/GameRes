    "description": "<i>You are trespassing in the abandoned childhood home of your 92-year-old grandmother. You have been fascinated by the stories about her youth years for most of your life, but last summer you finally decided to record her reminiscing so that you can share these stories with the online world. Now all you need are some pictures of the house and maybe some of the objects that are still in there. If only the owners would have replied to your phone calls...</i><br><br>Brukel is a first-person exploration game that is centered around the memories of Bie Verlinden, the grandmother of Belgian game designer Bob De Schutter. Players visit the abandoned Brukel farmhouse and use their smartphone camera to illustrate Bie's authentic stories. As time passes, the house takes players on an emotional journey through some of the traumatic events that Bie lived through.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1073900/extras/cff84418e61e2fd685f991690aac0e42.poster.avif?t=1745956880\" width=600 height=336 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1073900/extras/cff84418e61e2fd685f991690aac0e42.webm?t=1745956880\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1073900/extras/cff84418e61e2fd685f991690aac0e42.mp4?t=1745956880\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><i>The game’s primary mechanic is using a camera phone to take pictures of various items in the house.
