New railways are cheap when laid across bare fields, but can be expensive when demolishing forests, villages and other existing structures.<br></li><li>Manage increasing traffic by constructing, switches, sidings and spurs so that multiple trains can run without delays, at the same time.<br></li><li>Stay accident-free by precisely controlling trains during crucial moments, using pause for planning (you can build railways and schedule trains while on pause).<br></li><li>Play through 4 seasons: Europe (1830–1980), America (1840–1960), USSR (1880–1980) and Japan (1900–2020). (*The Early Access version currently offers 3 seasons, the Japanese levels are still in development).<br></li><li>Complete the story mode featuring such real-life events as the Gold Rush of 1849, the construction of the Florida Overseas Railroad, World War II, the Cold War, the launch of the first manned space flight Vostok 1 and more.<br></li><li>Explore the game in different game modes: in story mode (5-10 minutes), in random mode (15-20 minutes – the level looks and develops differently every time you launch) or in sandbox-like regime (can be turned on for both story and random modes. It allows to play without time and money limits).<br></li><li>Discover 15 types of trains – from early steam-powered locomotives to modern high-speed trains (*the Early Access version currently features 10), driving 18 types of cars – from old-time passenger cars to hoppers and cisterns and to military-use tank and gun platforms (*the Early Access version currently features 14).</li></ul>",
