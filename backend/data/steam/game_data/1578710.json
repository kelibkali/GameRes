Although you are able to go anywhere you want, you can't actually go.<br><br>REDITUM is a short first-person puzzle platforming game.<br>You can change the gravity. You can walk the walls. You can swap the boxes. You have to solve puzzles and pass levels.<br><br><strong> Walls: </strong> If you press (E) to a wall, you rotate the simulation.<br><br><strong> Boxes: </strong> There are 2 kinds of boxes. On the arrow, they fall on the wall they show. You can open the doors by moving them.<br>Empty boxes are not affected by gravity. You have to use them to overcome obstacles.<br><br><strong> Lasers: </strong> You can reflect the lasers by placing the Reflectors in appropriate places. You must carry the power and open the doors.<br><br><strong> Portal: </strong> You must activate the portal by finding the Pieces of Power in the simulation.<br><br><br><br>Thanks for the music: Abstraction Music",
