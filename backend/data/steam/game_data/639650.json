Unlimited energy, but each hit reduces your score multiplier</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >POWER-UPS - Kill, Catch or Collect</h2><br>Each power-up has 2 uses, one when collected by the players ship and the other when shot and destroyed. <br>If you catch a power-up before it hits the ground then it's effect is increased. (ie. More energy is regained or lasers, rockets or shield last longer.)  A successful catch is indicated by a heart.<br><br><strong>Kill, Catch or Collect?</strong><br><br>The 4 types and uses are as follows:<br><br><i>1. Energy Power-ups (green)</i><br>Kill - creates a large explosion<br>Catch or Collect - restore player energy<br><br><i>2. Laser Power-ups (red)</i><br>Kill - deploys a temporary horizontally firing laser turret <br>Catch or Collect - grants the player a temporary weapon increase<br><br><i>3. Rockets Power-ups (purple)</i><br>Kill - deploys a temporary rotating rocket launching turret<br>Catch or Collect - grants player a temporary rocket power-up<br><br><i>4.

To do this string a lot of kills together quickly.  Failing to kill anything causes the gauge to drop.<br><br><strong>Abductions...of Man &amp; Multipliers</strong><br>When a certain number of enemies reach the ground a Man will be abducted by a yellow saucer.  As well as abducting Man the saucer takes x3 from your multiplier.<br><br>Kill the saucer and allow Man to fall safely to the ground and your x3 multiplier is returned.<br><br>The number of enemies reaching the ground needed to trigger an abduction reduces as your multiplier increases.  High multipliers are hard to defend.<br><br><strong>Coins</strong><br>Many in game actions such as killing certain enemies trigger a coin drop.  Pick up the coins for extra points (5pts x multi), catch them for a further bonus (10pts x multi).  Caught coins are indicated by a heart.<br><br><strong>Bonuses</strong><br>Complete any of these in game actions to trigger a bonus coin drop...<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Arcadia - Survive a level<br></li><li>Astro Blaster - get a new high multiplier for your current game<br></li><li>Major Havoc - trigger 2 Astro Blasters within 5 secs<br></li><li>Missile Command - have 2 remote missile launchers active at the same time<br></li><li>Laser Zone - have 2 remote lasers active at the same time<br></li><li>Bomberman - kill lots of enemies in an energy power-up explosion<br></li><li>Defender - stop any enemy reaching the ground for 30 secs<br></li><li>Repulsar - Ram an enemy with your shields<br></li><li>2084 - rescue Man from the saucers 3 times in a row</li></ul><br>If you like 1982 then checkout this other game made by Binary Zoo:<br>",
