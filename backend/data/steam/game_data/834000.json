    "description": "Welcome to Cross Country Skiing VR! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour task is to finish before your opponent in a virtual, cross country skiing race. But watch out! You're ski poles are very short so squat down and really get moving with your arms to get a head start and cross the finish line first. You choose if you want to face off your opponent in a 500 or a 1 000 meter track. Get your heart rate going in the snowy, virtual forest tracks!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis version of Cross Country Skiing VR is a first release created to explore how VR can be used to motivate and promote physical activity. It's a short and straight forward race of cross country skiing ideal to be a part of e.g. a workout warm up. Please share any feedback for future development. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for playing!",
