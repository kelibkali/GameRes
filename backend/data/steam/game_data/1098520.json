    "description": "Immerse yourself even more in the world with the VR compatible version of Explore Fushimi Inari. I was happily surprised with how well the scene runs in virtual reality, the quality is almost on par with the desktop version and it still runs great. Compatible with Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.<br />\r\nEverything from the desktop version is here, including a few enhancements for VR:<br />\r\n- Elaborate DSLR Camera with zoom and auto focus capability<br />\r\n- Teleportation and Locomotion movement options<br />\r\n- Optimized UI and menus including quality settings and music player<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Please note that the HTC Vive has some limited functionality. You cannot use the DLSR camera/viewfinder mode but you can still take photos in an alternate camera mode. Access to the menu has also been disabled, meaning that there are no video adjustment/music settings (like there are on oculus).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMusic Licence for this DLC Provided by Chillhop Records.",
