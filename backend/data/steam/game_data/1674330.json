This woman; you know her, don't you? But wait, who are you? Everything feels so familiar, but none of it makes sense. And still, there's something wrong here, like a low hum of warning, droning beneath the eerie silence of this place. Maybe you should leave.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674330/extras/6637623e074cb244e5d182115bda80d3.avif?t=1634214235\" width=600 height=200 /></span><br>Sometime in the late 1970's a small, isolated town is plagued by a masked lunatic. You find yourself at the door of a vast home nestled in the mountainous outskirts of the lonely forest surrounding the town. Experiencing a bizarre lapse in understanding, you are left to your own wits to find an answer to a question you don't even know to ask. Meanwhile, you are being hunted, and perhaps a narrow escape is as good an answer as you are going to find.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674330/extras/1a60b24205e5ca07b0907bc646619ff9.avif?t=1634214235\" width=600 height=200 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Immersive first-person exploration<br></li><li>No HUD<br></li><li>&quot;Implied&quot; inventory that manages itself without needing to sift through clunky menus (simply interact with things of note)<br></li><li>Claustrophobic hallways and tight corners<br></li><li>Panic room with sealable door for guaranteed safety<br></li><li>All original assets and soundtrack, including 4 tracks produced in the style of classic 70's rock</li></ul>",
