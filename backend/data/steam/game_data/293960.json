    "description": "Strategy, trade and empire building on the old Silk Road. Spice Road is a town building, social and economic simulation game full of original challenges.<br><br>&quot;Deep in the mountains and deserts of central Asia, where life is hard and death is sudden, thin trails of gold, silk and spice trace a web between the industrial forges of the West and the exotic climes of the East.&quot;<br><br>You are a colonial governor in the 18th Century, building a town on the Spice Road in a time of war and discovery. More than spice travels your roads – musket armies, philosophies, and power plays that span the globe are at your control. From palace to monastry, trade post to smugglers den – your town is worthless without the nobles, monks, merchants and rogues that chose to live in it – and keeping them all happy at the same time is never simple.<br><br>Spice Road uses the StormRaid™ engine to deliver a beautiful fully 3D rendered world on high-end DirectX® graphics cards.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>    Advanced economic and trading simulation. 3 tiers of industry provide goods and services for populations of citizens, slaves and nobles with full control over wages and taxation.<br></li><li>    Build a network of farms, mines and caravan routes. Scout the map to find rare and exotic goods to export to distant lands.<br></li><li>    Defeat Bandit raiders, or pay them tribute to keep your routes peaceful.<br></li><li>    Compete against cunning corporate rivals. Choose diplomacy or raid their caravans and wage war on their cities.<br></li><li>    Meet your citizen's social and religious needs. Attract visiting explorers or pilgrims by developing the entertainment or spiritual side of your town.<br></li><li>    20 Campaign Missions + generate new maps in Sandbox mode. </li></ul><br><strong>Player Comments:</strong><br><br><i> &quot;I think it's genuinely fantastic. I play many strategy games, and it's hard to find a mid-level title that is as solid as Spice Road in terms of gameplay.&quot;</i> - Colin<br><br><i>&quot;This must be one of the best indie titles I've ever played. I really love it how new features that you unlock bring new challenges... the deep gameplay is something that I enjoyed most in Spice Road!&quot;</i> - Pawel<br><br><i>&quot;An excellent game... Having TONS of fun&quot;</i> - Unchayned",
