    "description": "WHEEL TRAVEL is a game about traveling in &quot;your&quot; car.<br />\r\nOwn and customize cars, earn money by transporting cargo and more, and explore a vast off-road world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt has been in development for a very long time, but it still lacks content and has many bugs and problematic features. See the release notes for details.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn example of an element implemented in the current game<br />\r\n・Car customization: In addition to changing bumpers and increasing tire diameter, you can also swap engines, replace suspensions, and set decals.<br />\r\n・Vehicle type: There is only one type. We are planning to add light four-wheel drive vehicles, and we are also considering adding two-wheeled vehicles.<br />\r\n・Off-road vehicle behavior: It's not a perfect physics calculation, but we're working on it.<br />\r\n・Travel: You can travel seamlessly on a 15km north-south map. However, the current density is not sufficient. It's a post-apocalyptic world view, and there are meaningful buildings, but you can't know the background even if you explore.<br />\r\n- Cargo Transport: Currently, only 3 types of cargo are implemented.",
