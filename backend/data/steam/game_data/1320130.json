Ninja robots Robyu and Bytron race to recover the golden skulls that have been stolen by each of Giorqio's 6 Hench-bots. Slicing everything in their path, they must reach their destination quickly. The Hench-bots grow stronger with time and exposure to the skulls. <br><br>But Robyu and Bytron have counter measures. In each level, collect gears enabling JetJump, DashBlade, and Shuriken. Maintain all 3 at once and subsequent gears engage HyperSpeed! But it's not that simple - take damage, and you lose whatever you have. Will you play slow and risk a tough boss fight? Will you play fast and risk taking damage? The faster you finish, the better UPGRADES you earn! Acquire permanent augments like triple jump, infinite dash, spread shot, extra lives, drill attack, and much more!<br><br>Play along with a friend for a new twist on a classic formula! Teleport to your partner at any time to balance out any skill disparities. No Bot Left Behind: the trailing player is always equipped with recovery speed to close the gap. Deploy awesome tag team moves like BotSwat to even the odds. You've never played co-op like this!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1320130/extras/d9ef44f780b6ae88062a78469f578cac.avif?t=1622731996\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Vibrant, hand-drawn, comic art style<br></li><li>Large, colorful character sprites<br></li><li>Travel to exotic locales all over the bot-globe<br></li><li>Detailed cinematic cutscenes with a retro feel<br></li><li>Screen-filling boss fights</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1320130/extras/c8dca959a7cd4827a44dca79be3f99cf.avif?t=1622731996\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Challenging difficulty level<br></li><li>Single-hit kills; no grinding<br></li><li>Full-view camera; keep focused on the action in front of you<br></li><li>Gears and upgrades to increase speed<br></li><li>Many different types of enemies coming for you at all times<br></li><li>Hard driving metal-meets-8-bit soundtrack performed by renowned artist Daniel Tidwell</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1320130/extras/e7d82824d68661ecab1efb3892cad532.avif?t=1622731996\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Executing faster leads to rewards<br></li><li>Rewards allow you to go even faster<br></li><li>Non-linear level progression<br></li><li>Beat your best times in 6 harrowing Hench-bot levels, plus the ultimate endgame gauntlet<br></li><li>Play with a friend in local co-op</li></ul><br>Watch for  full release in 2020!<br><br>Follow our progress on twitter: ",
