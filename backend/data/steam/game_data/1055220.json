    "description": "<strong>THE TOOL</strong><br>Paint any of the available tanks with unlimited decals to fit it to your style.<br>Start with the many preset decals and brushes or import your custom ones,  simply place theese on a directory and they'll appear in the editor.<br><br><br><strong>PAINT OR SUBSTRACT</strong><br>Paint with desired opacity and substract the painted surfaces at your will, you can simulate wear by substracting with grunge for instance.<br>You can paint a base cammo pattern, bake it so that coating layer is permanent and paint decals such as dirt on top, erase theese while keeping the baked cammo intact.<br><br><strong>COMPLETE CONTROL</strong><br>Paint the whole tank at a time or isolate desired parts for a finely crafter skin. <br><br><strong> FULLY INTEGRATED </strong><br>When done, simply frame a representative area and the skin miniature for menu is generated at the same time the skin files are exported, you need not to deal with any folder or files, the skin is inmediatelly available for you to use it. Skin files are exported to an external folder so you can share theese with other players.<br><br><strong>SHIBUYA CROSSING</strong><br>In addition to the editior tools you get a superb model of the Shibuya Crossing where you can move the tank around different spots to get you neat shots. Editor photo button will hide when taking a picture, also, for you to get the desired shots a number of camera options are available such FOV, DOF among others.<br><br><strong>DEVELOPER NOTES</strong><br>Hey&gt;&gt; So, finally... a feature I've dreamed for loOOong time is finished,  developing this tool has required me to put my very best and several attemps, its a pretty complex thing to build up and make it run smooth as it does, hope you all have the same fun experience I had while using it. Thanks to IRobi Dev Team for the very core of the tool in its raw state.",
