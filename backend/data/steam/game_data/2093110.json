    "description": "Set in the wild west, you are a bounty hunter out for the rewards. Your task is to eliminate the monsters that has recently appeared. But there is a catch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn each level you find yourself in a small area. Your opponent is somewhere there but does not reveal itself visually. Therefore, you must track it down by listening for the sound it emits when you are close. When you have located it, you shoot, before it attacks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSet out on a quest in 30, short, hunter vs hunter levels, where you will duel these beasts across multiple different maps, and eventually eliminate the source for good.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHeadphones strongly recommended.",
