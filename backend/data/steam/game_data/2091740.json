Hell no. His tunnel vision and stubbornness will force him to fix his reality and face the main subject arising in each level of the Metaverx: should he stop trying for the sake of his friends?<br><br>A quest where each level presents itself as a challenge.<br><br><strong>Unfinished business</strong><br>Not everything must be solved in the Metaverx. You faced the Rex, now it is time to face the Queenx.<br><br><strong>Featurex</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Old school point and click adventure - <i>Monkey Island, Beneath a steel sky, Hollywood Monsters</i>... You know what I´m talking about. Simple mechanics, some challenging puzzles and pixel hunting <strong>(you´ve been warned)</strong>.<br></li><li>Standalone Story – Set after <i>From Lex to Rex</i>, features some recurring characters and themes in addition to new ones. Can it be played independently? Be my guest!<br></li><li>Logical nonsense! - Does cotton candy count as cloth? Of course, it is cotton, it says it on the name! Rest assured, just follow the clues, listen and sharpen your eyes: all puzzles adhere to a consistent internal logic.<br></li><li>Decissions matters: will you take the fast way or you´ll take your time to solve things the other way? There might be some rewards ahead...<br></li><li>Nice crisp retro pixel art work - which makes the game even more indie.<br></li><li>A love letter to pop culture - books, movies, music, etc. Look for those Easter eggs!<br></li><li>The Truffle Shuffle - The short prequel to the game (or the pre-sequel, whichever you prefer). Help Lex open his truffle business and the plot of the incoming game.<br></li><li>In numbers: 22 stages, 20+ scenarios, 100+ inventory items, 4500+ text lines, 200+ animations (characters, objets, scenarios...), 20+ ambient and music tracks, 40+ achievements (some of them depend on your actions), 1 developer.</li></ul><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2091740/extras/45b06051ade8d6e7b1621633424f84a5.avif?t=1768299383\" width=800 height=152 /></span>",
