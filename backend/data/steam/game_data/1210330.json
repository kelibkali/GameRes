Responsive controls and crisp, bright low-poly/pixel art visuals at a smooth framerate, with the sole exception of the final boss, which goes all in on the bullet hell elements teased in prior levels.”<br><br>“Really solid, clean, and fun arcade-action title with a lot of charm… one of my favorite action games I've played this year. ”<br><br>“…I can certainly see how this would be a speedrunner's delight.”<br><br>“Fast Paced Old School Fun at a Great Price”<br><br>“‘Mega Man meets Crash Bandicoot’. Hidden gem is right. This is a fun behind the back shooter platformer that takes you down corridors of baddies. The bad guys are mixed and matched to make each scenario unique and increasingly challenging.”",
