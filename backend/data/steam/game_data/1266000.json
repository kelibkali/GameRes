    "description": "Wildfire’s soundtrack is dynamic on implementation. These arrangements demonstrate progression through four games states; ambience, caution, alert and death. Sampled, orchestral instruments combine with synth elements to create a spiritual, otherworldly palette. Melodies are modal, mostly Aeolian and Lydian, and explore an evocative tritone motif, to depict forbidden magic. When cymbals start up, something’s alight! When you hear cellos and basses, a guard is nearby. By the time a pipe organ is added, you’ll be in for the fight of your life. Take an aural journey through this immersive, stealth experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n17 tracks in MP3 format, totalling 27 minutes in length.",
