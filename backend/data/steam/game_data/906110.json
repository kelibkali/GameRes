    "description": "Minotaur Arcade Vol. 1 brings you two arcade-style games in a classic yet modern style. You can even play in VR to get that Tron-esque feeling of being inside an arcade game.<br><br>Vol. 1 comprises two classic Llamasoft titles: Gridrunner, an exhilarating shooter; and Goatup, a fun platformer.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/906110/extras/0f5826db34218f3bcc76a35b0fc6b545.avif?t=1742484205\" width=640 height=360 /></span><br><br>Gridrunner is a classic Llamasoft title that was created in the days of the Vic 20 and which has evolved across many platforms over the intervening years. This implementation strips away complexity and is an attempt to imagine what an arcade game of Gridrunner might have looked like had it been implemented on arcade hardware of the time. (Well, we do allow ourselves some modern comforts, like being able to model every pixel of the display as voxels, and that whole thing of being able to play in VR).<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/906110/extras/08eb490b40e2930e425e43995557f25f.avif?t=1742484205\" width=640 height=360 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><i>Simple beginnings: shoot the baddies on the grid with your little green ship.</i></h2><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/906110/extras/2ca310e43e0b5d2a167931de77e40822.avif?t=1742484205\" width=640 height=360 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><i>Celebrate Britain's newfound global chumpery by blowing up the Union Jack on level 2.</i></h2><br><br>The result is pure score-chasing fun.
