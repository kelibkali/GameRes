It blends physics-based gameplay, pixel-perfect controls, and mad level design into a game that lives from all the faceplants, uncountable retries, and relentless breaking of records.<br><br>The path to the new record is simple. You hit a section, and try to improve it.<br><br><i>Land too far.</i><br><i>Crash.</i><br><i>A little out of balance.</i><br><br>Forty attempts later, you're consistently two tenths faster. Do the same for the last loop in the level, then string it all together for a time that—by some small miracle—ends up just under 37 seconds. That's #4 overall. And there's still that early section to work on!<br><br>This game is perfect for those who just <i>know</i> they can squeeze one tiny fraction more out of their run.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Dozens of extraordinary tracks. Varying in difficulty, style, and pacing, each 30-120 seconds in length, some of them quite outrageous.</li><li>Ghost runs. Not only to know how fast you're going in comparison, but also to get a look at how others are making their records.<br></li><li>Leaderboards. See where you stand in a competition between friends or—if you're that good—among the world elite at the very top of the standings.</li></ul><br>Grab your helmet and let's start breaking records!",
