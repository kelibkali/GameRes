    "description": "<strong>Strategically build your base &amp; defend it from players and bots; in a world where anyone can meet up.</strong><br><br>The world is one where every player can meet up. The game is developed to support a seamless world which can grow in size as player demand increases. This allows you to compete against other players &amp; also work together with friends.<br><br>Build your base &amp; develop it further as you find blueprints to craft more durable and more efficient items. Anything you see in the game can be broken and collected. Thus, resource gathering is a big part of the game. As you use gathered items to craft new items to defend yourself &amp; your base. As it develops with time.<br><br>If no players are online. Don't worry there are bots which regularly attack your base. To challenge your strategic thinking. Your base also slowly decays. So make sure to upgrade things to keep them durable and make them last longer. You can also improve the efficiency if your base's development by focusing on crafting technologies which help you get resources faster.<br><br>Most of the weapons in this game are strategically based. They can be placed to defend your base. Perhaps hidden behind a bush. Rather than having guns which you use actively to shoot with; You use more of a tower-defense kind of thinking to defend your base.<br><br>If you so happen to connect with other players. You can easily exchange items in the world or maybe even share electricity between your bases if you are neighbors.<br><br>Grow plants with unique genetics to keep you fed &amp; craft clothes to endure extreme temperatures. Keep your plant's safe from rats by keeping them inside your base.<br><br>The world has a temporary world border. Meaning the world grows larger as the player demand for the game increases.<br><strong>Currently the world is almost 1 KM * 1KM(0.62 miles * 0.62) in size.</strong><br><br><strong>The current server(s) is in North America</strong>. However, the plan is to add a EU server in the near future. As a EU player it could still work okay on the current server.<br><br>More things will be added with time to the game. Feel free to give suggestions!",
