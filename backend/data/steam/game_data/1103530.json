    "description": "Cascadia Quest is a reboot of the classic adventure games from the mid eighties. You'll take on the role of an eager but incompetent junior ranger in the lush forests surrounding Foreboding Spire. You'll be sent on a wild adventure into deep forest, up snowy mountains, into mysterious caverns, all the while trying to uncover a mysterious plot to sabotage the wilderness. The game is infused with lore from the Pacific Northwest region of the USA.<br><br>Before point-and-click games came along, adventure game characters were controlled by typing. Frustrating? By today's standards, yes it was! Cascadia Quest brings this back this freedom, but with a modern contextual parser including <i>futuristic</i> features like autosuggest.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1103530/extras/b0685ec74cbd37a6fa327cf054f15505.poster.avif?t=1699201946\" width=500 height=374 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1103530/extras/b0685ec74cbd37a6fa327cf054f15505.webm?t=1699201946\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1103530/extras/b0685ec74cbd37a6fa327cf054f15505.mp4?t=1699201946\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1103530/extras/38cda7823268c71d8360ca610af4fa50.poster.avif?t=1699201946\" width=500 height=374 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1103530/extras/38cda7823268c71d8360ca610af4fa50.webm?t=1699201946\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1103530/extras/38cda7823268c71d8360ca610af4fa50.mp4?t=1699201946\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>If you ever miss your time spent as a space-faring janitor, a teenager imprisoned by a terrifying wizard, or a young journalist investigating a murder in a mansion, then Cascadia Quest is ready to welcome you back.<br><br><strong>Key Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Location-aware text parser with both auto-suggest and auto-correct - fat finger your way to puzzle glory.
