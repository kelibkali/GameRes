    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Episode 2 Story</h2><br>The Kokurase gang's peaceful days didn't last forever. Soon after the events of the last episode, Kanta reports they got a request from... a GHOST!? The &quot;ghost&quot; turns out to be second year honors student Kotaro Hino, who needs Kokurase's help to confess his love to the popular Madoka Asagaya. Overcoming Kotaro's timidness will be a challenge, not to mention that Madoka might already have a boyfriend.<br><br>Meanwhile, a mysterious group called &quot;TRL (Thin Red Liners)&quot; is secretly working to undo the Kokurase gang. Kokurase's only chance is the school festival, where boys can ask girls they have a crush on to dance. But an extremist group called &quot;Jealousy Encourage Corps&quot; works to abolish the dance. With all this adversity, will Kokurase succeed in their matchmaking or will &quot;the threads of fate be restored&quot;?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/558640/extras/d37d2ac3a3f097c5517240420b7bd348.avif?t=1674468131\" width=600 height=171 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/558640/extras/1ec6b57b90a8c0b61a602fb8cca8626b.avif?t=1674468131\" width=600 height=171 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/558640/extras/366a66874a6a8093fce5172ed258af06.avif?t=1674468131\" width=600 height=171 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Featuring:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A Visual Novel in RPGmaker<br></li><li>Beautiful art by an illustrator Doromizu<br></li><li>Full of humor<br></li><li>Cast of quirky protagonists<br></li><li>Take control of multiple characters to advance the plot<br></li><li>Use Key Phrases to progress conversations<br></li><li>Explore a High School campus<br></li><li>Speech Puzzles<br></li><li>Teenage, Highschooler angst</li></ul><br><u>Episode 1 is free to play</u><br>",
