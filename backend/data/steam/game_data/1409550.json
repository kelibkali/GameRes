Supported by it’s massive list of (112+!) characters, heartfelt story, and uniquely weird art style, Creepslore is here to make you laugh, cry, and question it’s creators' sanity and overall well being.<br><br>The game takes place sometime during the 1970's, and is told from the point of view of a sarcastic character who gets suckered into an adventure after arriving on a monster filled island. Realizing there's no way back, he now has to deal with a bunch of intoxicated creatures with idiosyncratic tendencies (ergo: they’re also stupid) who think humans are the de-facto best gourmet food option. <br><br><br><strong>What this game offers:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>surreal &amp; tongue in cheek humor<br></li><li>a story with 5 completely different scenarios (no forced repeats of dialogues to unlock 'extra' content!)<br></li><li>18 explorable locations, ranging from cities to swamps<br></li><li>more than 110 individual characters<br></li><li>pre-rendered backgrounds created in Quake<br></li><li>even MORE NUMBERS to grab your attention<br></li><li>text, text and some more text<br></li><li>a sad fish</li></ul><br><strong>What this game DOESN'T offer:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>saving the world<br></li><li>cute anime girls<br></li><li>fan-service<br></li><li>a happy fish</li></ul><br>PS: if you've ever wondered <strong>why the Giant Spider in Skyrim carries coins</strong>, and <strong>where the hell it puts them</strong>, we'll, let's just say we have the answer to that.",
