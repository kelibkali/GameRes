    "description": "Just like the game, this soundtrack takes you all over the world: from the beaches of the Caribbean to the Andean mountains and the Transylvanian forests. The Renowned Explorers’ theme song is woven through it all to make sure the tone is set for adventure!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor this soundtrack’s release, Abbey Games’ longtime composer Joni van der Leeuw dove back into the source material to rearrange and remaster the lion’s share of the music from the game into an actual album of twelve tracks. Next to music that you’ll probably recognise from the game, there’s also music from one of the trailers for the game and even a previously unreleased track of music that was used to pitch the idea of the soundtrack within the Abbey Games development team.",
