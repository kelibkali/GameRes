    "description": "<i> PhotoWorld: Smooth Corners </i> is a third person 3D visual game in which the world is created for the player. You can just run, study the map and take pictures of the species you like, which will be saved in the album and on your computer, or you can be a hunter for rare objects that sometimes appear on the way. The game has tasks for the completion of which you will receive achievements.<br>The drone is your assistant in this. It is your constant companion, with the help of which you can get into hard-to-reach places and take a wonderful picture.<br>There are many characters and their assistants to choose from for every taste.<br>The whole game is made in lowpoly, so it looks very calm and peaceful. With a light musical accompaniment, you can simply relax and immerse yourself in a wonderfully created world, which is an island in the ocean.<br><strong> Good luck with your studies! :) [/]</strong>",
