    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Lands of Dream is a classic cycle of point &amp; click adventure games (and one text adventure) that started back before the big indie game boom even began, in the days of freeware and shareware. The biggest and most elaborate one is <i>The Sea Will Claim Everything</i>, which is what this Steam page was originally for, but the other games are now also available here.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Each game tells a story from the Lands of Dream, a place beyond our own world yet profoundly tied to it - a world of the imagination, of death, of transformation. They have serious ideas and bad jokes, and far too many mushrooms to click on. Together the individual stories form a tapestry telling of the war against Lord Urizen, the god-king of false reason, and the struggle to preserve Oneiropolis, the City of Dreams.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Games Included</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Strange And Somewhat Sinister Tale of the House at Desert Bridge</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Book of Living Magic</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Fabulous Screech</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Sea Will Claim Everything</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A Postcard From Afthonia</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Matter of the Great Red Dragon</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Disclaimer</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >These games were made in the DIY spirit of the time, with a focus on design and storytelling, not technical excellence, and some of them are very old now.
