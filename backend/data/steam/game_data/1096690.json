    "description": "<strong>Mighty Fight</strong> is a throwback to classic 3D arena fighters, but with a focus on fighting game fundamentals. Select from a roster of characters each with distinct and deep combo opportunities. Use the game's Hype mechanics to zone, evade, counter and play mind-games with your opponents. Mighty Fight combines the old with the new in a fresh competitive twist on the party-fighter genre.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1096690/extras/3a84e58ff5a5b8c754b5155b98416676.avif?t=1636141782\" width=600 height=100 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Hype Energy </strong></h2>Dealing and receiving damage builds up <i>Hype Energy</i>.
