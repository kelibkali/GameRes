Grow in might as a mage in an open-world RPG inspired by Dragonlance, full of kingdoms that will rise and fall, economies that can boom or bust, and monstrous creatures that can overwhelm the land if left unchecked.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/506480/extras/d24a1d75ff2b592e023aa50b77055437.poster.avif?t=1747408516\" width=616 height=318 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/506480/extras/d24a1d75ff2b592e023aa50b77055437.webm?t=1747408516\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/506480/extras/d24a1d75ff2b592e023aa50b77055437.mp4?t=1747408516\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Immerse yourself in a player-driven story that evolves based on your decisions. Like in pen and paper games, every choice is yours and every choice can change the world. Will you earn the trust of the Conclave only to betray them later? Will you choose a life of crime, stealing from merchants and living on the run? Will you build friendships and rivalries with your companions from mage school? Will you forego a life of magic to pursue the simple existence of a trader? Or will you strive to ascend the heights of power, for good or ill?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/506480/extras/b1705b07536b993e7e188288e0a7f556.poster.avif?t=1747408516\" width=616 height=318 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/506480/extras/b1705b07536b993e7e188288e0a7f556.webm?t=1747408516\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/506480/extras/b1705b07536b993e7e188288e0a7f556.mp4?t=1747408516\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>The dynamic and living land of Vaelun reacts to your deeds, giving you the unique opportunity to shape the story and the world around you. Every choice you make can have real and far-reaching consequences for all those who dwell in this world.
