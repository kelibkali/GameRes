    "description": "Born from 2 mates drinking beers, watching cricket, and believing they could do better than the overpaid Aussie spuds currently doing the rounds in world cricket, Spud Cricket VR is a Virtual Reality cricket game for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Play 5,10 OR 20 overs against a mate, 1 innings at a time. Simple fun, slog it hard, casual cricket game. You will love smacking the bowler over the fence as you try to be the next Davey Warner! But you wont. Your a spud. Might get a game for Australia though...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures include: <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Single or local multiplayer modes<br />\r\n- 3 types of matches - 5, 10 or 20 over match.<br />\r\n- 3 difficulty levels.<br />\r\n- Use of the HTC Vive hand controller for realistic batting action.<br />\r\n- Bat either left or right handed.<br />\r\n- The bat has a sweet spot. Time those shots for the runs. Haptic feedback will tell the story.<br />\r\n- AI fielders that adjust to your big shots.<br />\r\n- Not all batters were born equal. As you go down the batting list, so does the skill of your batters.<br />\r\n- Customisable line, length and speed for the bowler player in local multiplayer - Suprise your friend batting with a sudden slower delivery or a yorker.<br />\r\n- Double up with fielding customisation in local multiplayer - dont just bowl it different, plan your fielding setup as well and entice the batter into the big hit, only to get caught.<br />\r\n- In game crowd noise and reaction to shots, wickets and other moments. <br />\r\n- Scoreboards both in game and for the desktop with detailed batter information.<br />\r\n- Multiple views for Batter and bowler.<br />\r\n- Action replays! You can repeatedly watch the big 6 you just smashed off your friends bowling!<br />\r\n- Money for nothing and your runs for free? Hit the hovering target for free runs!",
