    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > D&amp;D Classics: S2 White Plume Mountain (1E)</h2>White Plume Mountain has always been a subject of superstitious awe to the neighboring villagers. People still travel many miles to gaze upon this natural wonder, though few will approach it closely, as it is reputed to be the haunt of various demons and devils.<br>This adventure contains background information, referee's notes, player aids, a complete map level, and a cutaway view of the mountain complex. White Plume Mountain is form the Special (&quot;S&quot;) series; like others in this series, it is meant to stand on its own and is a complete Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure.<br>For 4-10 characters levels 5-10.<br><strong><br><i> We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today.

This content is presented as it was originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed.
