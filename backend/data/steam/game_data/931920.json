    "description": "Volume 11? Of Hiveswap Friendsim? Eleven volumes, 23 trolls, and you’re still alive, still in an approximation of fighting form, and still kicking it in this hostile alien environment. Hell, you’re barely even an outsider anymore. You know the games, you know the memes, you got this. We can’t even come up with something absolutely ridiculous in this synopsis because you’re on to us—you know what we look like when we’re on our bullshit. So here’s this very normal and totally unremarkable game synopsis that isn’t even really a synopsis anymore.<br><br>Volume 11: There’s some trolls. Impenetrable cultural jargon. You make friends. Whatever.<br><br>---<br><br>You just crash-landed on Alternia, and you’re <strong>DESPERATE</strong> for friendship! Anyone will do...wait, who are those two trolls approaching you?<br><br>The <i>Hiveswap Friendsim</i> is a quick, loosely-canonical visual novel adventure following the efforts of the unnamed protagonist (that’s you!) to survive and maybe even thrive on the harsh surface of ALTERNIA. Set in the time of <i>Hiveswap: Act 1</i>, this episodic visual novel’s opening volume, written by Homestuck creator <strong>Andrew Hussie</strong>, is sure to satisfy <i>Homestuck</i> and <i>Hiveswap</i> fans who are eager for a darker stroll across the Alternian landscape. <br><br>Future episodes will arrive regularly as DLC.",
