    "description": "An action-puzzler where you try to create patterns to damage the various creatures of the Dracolord's domain. By clicking on the arrow orbs, you initiate chain reactions that add damage to your attack. Larger patterns will place new spells on the board, but there is also the risk of awakening the evil dracostones. Think fast, take chances and find the secret way to the final boss to win the game and end the Dracolord's reign forever!",
