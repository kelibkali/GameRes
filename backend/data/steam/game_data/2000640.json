    "description": "<strong><i>&quot;A TEARABLE game with CUTTING-edge gameplay&quot;</i></strong><br><br>The Paper Game is a creation containing all the joys and wonders of tearing paper, with only a fraction of the mess! What more have you ever wanted in a game themed around paper? <br><br>Click and drag your mouse, tearing through classic 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; sheets. Race against the clock, cutting through &quot;objective&quot; stickers, all the while avoiding various enemies and weaving around deceptively eye-catching stickers. Be careful not to cut anything else, otherwise your paper will ignite and your run will end! Doing well will reward you with stars, which unlocks new sticker packs, paper types, and INKredible paper puns!<br><br>This demo includes the tutorial, two levels, a top-down mode for each, endless mode and a few paper puns. In the released game there are more unlockable features, and many more game modes and paper puns.",
