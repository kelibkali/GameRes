    "description": "I believe that gaming should not be anything complicated or diffcult, <br />\r\nbut a relaxing and pleasure experience. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTherefore, I designed this ARPG <br />\r\n<br />\r\nbattle system which requires no attack button to play. <br />\r\nThe simplicity brings a fluent and interesting gaming experience. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEternal Senia is the realization of this concept. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI spent one year developing this game. <br />\r\nIt is a game that can be easily enjoyed by any player. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n●Characters: <br />\r\nHeroine Senia has both her name and the outlook from &quot;Ygnizem Seniar&quot; <br />\r\nin Ragnarok Online. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSenia's sister, Magaleta, also originates from a foe &quot;Magaleta&quot; in <br />\r\nlighthalzen dungeon of Ragnarok Online. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRagnarok Online is, to this day, still my favorite game of all time. <br />\r\nEtneralSenia is a non-profit making game solely based on my enthusiasm for RO and gaming developing. <br />\r\nI wish Eternal Senia can bring up the memory of classic <br />\r\nMMORPG Ragnarok Online to all players who participated.",
