    "description": "Go Outside simulator lets you enjoy the great outdoors without having to go outdoors! No time limits, no bad guys, no puzzles. Simple outdoor exploration. The point of the game is to just get lost in the different environments. If just walking around doesn't do it for you each environment has multiple hidden things to find. This game is currently very early in development and will be improved upon and added too as time goes on. This started out as a joke project but turned into a jumping off point to game development. Learning basics in level design and interactivity for future games. Be them for fun, education, or therapy such as exposure therapy VR programs to help people suffering from mental health issues such as agoraphobia.  It's very basic and simple, think of it as a joke or relaxation aid if nothing else.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you want to explore different environments and look for hidden secrets, or simply play something to calm yourself down and just exists without goals, deadlines, or threats, Go Outside Simulator is for you!",
