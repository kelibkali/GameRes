    "description": "Take control of your own racing drone and fly through a range of hand-crafted environments, each with enemies to race against and fire missiles at. An intuitive control scheme allows you to fly your drone surprisingly easily whether you use mouse and keyboard or controller, and the game's aesthetic but simple low poly style allows you to focus on going as fast as possible. You've raced on a track in 2 dimensions so many times already - are you ready to race in 3D?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a game that allows you to become really skilled in the flying mechanics. They take a while to pick up, but it's very rewarding when you master control of your drone and are able to fly almost impossible-looking lines easily. The game has full rebindable controls so you can control the game your way.",
