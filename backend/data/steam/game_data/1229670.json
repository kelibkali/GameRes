You'll find weapons and combat accessories like the<br><i> toxic scabbard</i> and<br><i> forgetful sap</i> alongside protective devices like<br><i> cryptwarden's plate</i> and the<br><i> roofrunner's buckler</i> . Delvers into the dank byways beneath the city will love<br><i> ratty robes</i> and the<br><i> sewer suit,</i> while those accustomed to high places will love the<br><i> lecturer's staff, senator's stole</i> , and the<br><i> scale of endless bureaucracy</i> ! Criminals will find handy devices like<br><i> pilferer's gloves</i> and the<br><i> cheater's hat</i> , while officers of the law wield the<br><i> mark of the authority, nightwatch crossbow,</i> and the<br><i> inspector's bullhorn</i> to bring them to justice! Wherever your heroes venture in adventures of urban intrigue, they'll find the perfect tools to take down treacherous advisers and bring justice to the streets.
