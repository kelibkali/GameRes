    "description": "The game BridgeFix 2=3-1 is based on the Japanese Hashi-wo-kakero (橋をかけろ, aka &quot;Hashi&quot;) logic puzzles. As with Sudoku, the rules of the puzzles are easy to understand but hard to master and create many interesting problems for the player to solve. <br><br>BridgeFix 2=3-1 extends the base puzzle rules by adding two new interesting mechanics which add a new twist: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Multiple links can have restrictions, e.g. having 3 active bridges in total.<br></li><li> Two connections can be &quot;entangled&quot;, i.e. always have the same state. </li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 5000 puzzles for your enjoyment.<br></li><li> The game can assist you by fading out nodes that are solved and marking those that are obvious mistakes. (Can be disabled in the settings)<br></li><li> Night mode with reduced brightness.<br></li><li> Steam achievements.<br></li><li> Three relaxing Asia-themed music tracks. </li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Rules</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1679200/extras/bcde5c5be88371f3b34a1eabdb897686.avif?t=1653632495\" width=488 height=276 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >How many puzzles are there?</h2>There are 5000 puzzles in total. 50% of the puzzles in each category are classical Hashi-wo-kakero puzzles, the other 50% feature the new entanglement and restriction rules. <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 1000x very small (12 islands)<br></li><li> 1000x small (20 islands)<br></li><li> 1000x middle (30 islands) <br></li><li> 1000x big (44 islands)<br></li><li> 1000x huge (50-60 islands)</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >How difficult are the puzzles?</h2>That is hard to answer objectively and depends on your skill as a player. Please have a look at the screenshots to get a feel for the size and difficulty of the puzzles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Where do the puzzles come from? </h2>The puzzles are generated using an algorithm I have written. So if you come close to solving all of the puzzles, send me a message and I can generate more. :)",
