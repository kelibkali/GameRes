I love create simple, fun and well designed games. My great inspirations are mostly games from the 8-bit and 16-bit era. I like every aspect of the process involved in making video games: pixel art, coding, game design and drawing. I've worked on several indie games. Micro Pico Racers is my last solo developed game project and has been in development for the past 1 year.<br><br>Micro Pico Racers hopes to bring back the blend of pure fun and challenge that was a staple of arcade classics.<br><br>Are you ready?",
