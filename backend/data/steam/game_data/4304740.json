Abandoned locations are filled with hostile factions, unpredictable enemies, and scarce resources. Each area offers multiple routes, constant threats, and rewards for those willing to move forward.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Manage your supplies, explore ruined environments, and adapt to situations that can change in seconds.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Loot, Survive, Extract</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Find weapons, gear, medical supplies, and valuable items. Everything you carry matters—death means losing it all.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Extract successfully, improve your loadout, and prepare to push into increasingly dangerous zones.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Varied Enemies, Constant Decisions</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Every enemy fights differently. Some attack in numbers, others rely on superior gear or smart positioning. Learn their patterns and decide when to fight, avoid confrontation, or strike at the right moment.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Solo or With Friends</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Play solo or team up online with up to five players. Coordinate movements, share resources, and cover each other—because a single mistake can cost the entire mission.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Surviving together is easier… but the risk is shared.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Prepare or Die</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Modify weapons, manage your inventory, and carefully choose what to bring into each expedition. Space is limited, and preparation often matters more than raw firepower.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Every run brings you one step closer to survival.</p>",
