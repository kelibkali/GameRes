    "description": "<strong>All content included is royalty-free</strong><br><br>Recorded at the world-class Bunker Studios in NYC, seven-string guitarist Charlie Hunter and jazz drum master Eric Harland bring the inimitable soul and feel of live musicians, playing together at the top of their game, to anyone’s tracks. <br><br>Vol 1 features two complete sessions (each containing over twenty different song sections) with a focus on laid back pocket and syncopated funk.  Each session is meticulously organized and edited, allowing you to quickly drag and drop the loops and multitrack sessions to create your own custom arrangement.<br><br>The Loop Loft employed a mix of old-world and cutting-edge recording equipment and technology to capture Harland and Hunter’s performances, including boutique and vintage microphones, compressors and premium converters. Harland played a 1960s Ludwig drum set, a range of classic snare drums and a palette of custom Zildjian cymbals, while Hunter played his seven-string guitar into separate guitar and bass amplifiers for discrete tone.<br><br>Multiple Grammy-nominated drummer Eric Harland is widely considered to be among the leading young drummers worldwide. Charlie Hunter is among the most unique musicians alive, performing rhythm and lead guitar parts as well as bass lines simultaneously. Both Harland and Hunter have enjoyed careers performing and recording with a veritable “who’s who” of jazz, pop, and other contemporary music personalities including D'Angelo, McCoy Tyner, Norah Jones, Frank Ocean and Mos Def.",
