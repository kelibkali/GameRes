DoT is powered by machine learning.... and electricity!<br><br>Stick around to play with DoT in VR.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1550280/extras/eaf1cc4211ed421230e1db14b070ca9b.avif?t=1701346444\" width=616 height=188 /></span>.<br><br><strong>RETURN TO CHILDHOOD</strong><br><br><strong>1. </strong> Jamie's Toy Box and its mechanics are heavily inspired by toys and child-like imagination.<br><br><strong>2.</strong> In order to fully utilize the advantages of VR, surreal elements play an important role in the game, some are not obvious at first glance. For example, clicking the light switch causes a change to nighttime, following the roof's opening, revealing a view at the night sky.<br><br><strong>3.</strong> The game tries to capture the innocence and creativity of children, as well as the imaginary world they create for themselves so that adult players can once again experience the aw that can come from interactions with toys.<br><br><strong>PLAY AND BUILD WHAT YOU WANT</strong><br><br><strong>4.</strong> The game takes place in one playroom jam-packed with fun toys and interactive buttons. All of them offer unique gameplay mechanics.<br><br><strong>5.</strong> The player is not strictly limited by real-life physics and has access to a diverse set of toys when building structures. This allows for more abstract and artistic construction.",
