I tried my best to really capture the moment in the scenes and to emphasize emotion in the music (As best as I could).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >How to install/access the Soundtrack</h2><br>There's no installation process. Once purchased and downloaded, the soundtrack will show up in the games directory. The Soundtrack takes a little digging through the game's Steam Directory, which could be located in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Just Ignore Them<br><br>P.S This may not be the case for everyone, others directories may be different but it's in the [ \\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Just Ignore Them ] folder",
