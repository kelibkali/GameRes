Everything costs money in <i>DreamWorld</i> - even your own survival. Money is the standard resource in <i>DreamWorld</i>. Your primary goal as a player is survival and your end goal is to form your online network of players in order to make money to amplify your virtual life. New players spawn into the world with $0, naked and homeless, in a random spawn location on the map. All players have to make money for basic needs such as:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>food- restores various stats. If you starve you die<br></li><li>water- restores various stats. If you dehydrate you die<br></li><li>clothing- protect player from elements. could die if not properly protected in certain weather conditions <br></li><li>housing- offer a player a safe place to do various tasks and stay protected from outside weather conditions<br></li><li>and more....</li></ul> <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1280960/extras/15a412df2fec9320b7221b87e66bd09b.avif?t=1638306844\" width=696 height=254 /></span><br><br>The daily grind in DreamWorld is a lengthy process unless you form a massive team. Grinding for money/experience is time consuming, so it’s always the goal in DreamWorld to have people do it for you, that way you'll be able to spend your time doing other things, such as shopping for luxury items, upgrades, constructing new homes, breeding dogs etc.<br><br><br>Outside of the basic need stores, there are a variety of other stores and shopping centers throughout DreamWorld. Players use the money they've earned from surviving to shop at these stores and horde the extra items in their home or stash house, such as<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Jewelry<br></li><li>Vehicles<br></li><li>Furniture<br></li><li>and many more...</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1280960/extras/8502906969e22d5967dcdb69c5e21df2.avif?t=1638306844\" width=696 height=254 /></span><br><br>Players can buy pet dogs from the pet store. Dogs are your best friend and defense companions; your dogs will protect your territory online and offline. You can even travel with your dogs to be safe from other players or to raid other players. Dog death are permanent in DreamWorld. Players can breed dogs to avoid the financial drain of buying new dogs every time one of their dogs die. Each dog is born with a unique set of stats, which can be increased by training and performing various tasks with your dog. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1280960/extras/28c0d16f206a5792089878f0b3a72871.avif?t=1638306844\" width=696 height=254 /></span><br><br>DreamWorld is a pretty dangerous place. There are a lot of crimes being committed. It is the job of DreamWorld’s police department to keep DreamWorld safe. DreamWorld police are real players, but they aren’t playing the same game as the survivalist. <br><br><br>The police do not have to form a gang like the survivalist, instead they partner with other police and usually travel in pairs or more, never alone. DreamWorld police are very strong compared to survivalists, so the numbers of police allowed on the map is limited but this does not stop their effectiveness.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1280960/extras/5050279010453c4ad76a8dd0cf2484e4.avif?t=1638306844\" width=696 height=254 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1280960/extras/95396a9327f41dfd0f59d2a72bdf7e3c.avif?t=1638306844\" width=696 height=254 /></span>",
