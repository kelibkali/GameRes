Battles take place in over 25 arenas spread across 3 levels with various optional arenas if you're not in a rush to get out. Don't expect enemies to be pushovers, every battle is a boss battle.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/578390/extras/bf0ac9741094afdfc08f322af37333d9.poster.avif?t=1565023549\" width=600 height=286 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/578390/extras/bf0ac9741094afdfc08f322af37333d9.webm?t=1565023549\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/578390/extras/bf0ac9741094afdfc08f322af37333d9.mp4?t=1565023549\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/578390/extras/a2f82e05c92dfc544e3166b9a8821fa6.avif?t=1565023549\" width=600 height=91 /></span><br>There's three enemy types that you'll encounter that'll evolve and use different tactics as you make it through the game. The first enemy you find may feel like a tin can but by the end of the game you'll have the death screen burned into your eyes. Remnith has five difficulty levels. If you don't like dying or want to run through the game quickly then try out the <i>Tin Can</i> difficulty. If you really want a challenge then <i>Doomsday Device</i> is for you.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/578390/extras/11a5535f95db6bc190d999267588779b.poster.avif?t=1565023549\" width=600 height=294 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/578390/extras/11a5535f95db6bc190d999267588779b.webm?t=1565023549\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/578390/extras/11a5535f95db6bc190d999267588779b.mp4?t=1565023549\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/578390/extras/01cc40a1d3d2c73ad05a1ee16e83b75a.avif?t=1565023549\" width=600 height=91 /></span><br>Everytime the environment is shot an Energy Scab is created that feeds energy into all enemies in the area.

When using motion controllers you have a choice of a few locomotion options such as thumbstick/trackpad movement and teleportation. You can play either sitting or standing, the game isn't room-scaled but you do need a 360 setup if you're going to play standing without thumbstick/trackpad turning. There's also a flat mode if you want to play without a VR headset.<br><br>If you're used to quick movements in VR then you'll be able dash around your enemies and jump off of ramps. If you prefer an experience that's easier on your stomach then you can use long range teleportation and snipe your enemies across the map. Teleportation works no matter where your destination point is allowing you to focus on your target rather than finding a valid place to teleport. If you need to teleport out of the way quickly just point in the general direction you want to go without looking. If a wall was selected you'll teleport to the nearest point on the floor.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/578390/extras/343f2789a75d54467ab1d9a7b21d146e.poster.avif?t=1565023549\" width=562 height=198 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/578390/extras/343f2789a75d54467ab1d9a7b21d146e.webm?t=1565023549\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/578390/extras/343f2789a75d54467ab1d9a7b21d146e.mp4?t=1565023549\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/578390/extras/6ccda9a13d0279e5465a0f3f667fc6ad.poster.avif?t=1565023549\" width=560 height=198 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/578390/extras/6ccda9a13d0279e5465a0f3f667fc6ad.webm?t=1565023549\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/578390/extras/6ccda9a13d0279e5465a0f3f667fc6ad.mp4?t=1565023549\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Your cannons are controlled based off of where your pointing when using motion controllers, when using a gamepad or mouse you aim where you look.
