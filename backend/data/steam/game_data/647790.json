You can talk things through or sketch on a whiteboard just like you would in person. You can bring up files on your computer and literally point out the issues and come up with solutions. You can even have a side conversation in the corner when that one loud mouth is taking over the meeting. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCurrent version includes unlimited whiteboards and virtual desktops. Create and move them anywhere in your space.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFuture versions will include networking, room creation, import and export of data.",
