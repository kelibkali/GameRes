    "description": "<i>14 hours from now:</i> Your thumbs mash the smooth buttons of your gamepad, as a bead of sweat drips down your forehead. The smell of pizza rolls burning fills the air. You fire a flurry of moos and herd five enemies together while narrowly dodging a bullet. One extra life left, the funky music steadies your breath and re-focuses you. You press the “slow-moo” button and perfectly position yourself to unleash a massive FART! The gas radiates outward and annihilates the enemies in a satisfying cascade, multi-colored explosions bursting in rapid succession. Your point total grows, inching closer to your highest score.<br><br>The fire alarm goes off. You’ve just won the 43th level. One more and you’ll surely beat your personal best. Maybe you’ll even rank on the global leaderboard. The smoke burns your eyes. Just one more level.<br><br><i>15 seconds ago:</i> The bright colors and funky music of the trailer for Boom Boom Bovine draw you in, but you want to learn more. What does this game offer?
