Your life is yours to live, your choices yours to make, but beware! The world outside is not the paradise the historical Datacubes said it once was. Spores from the asteroid have ravaged the environment, leaving dangerous and horribly mutated wildlife in its wake. Humanity is scattered, divided into factions and gangs who fight with whatever they can find, be it spears, swords, guns or even with the ideas in their head, to shape what remains of the world in their own image. <br><br>If it's dangerous, and everything is, someone out there knows how to use it.<br><br>The choices are yours, but so are the consequences.<br><br><strong>Customize Your Character</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/727660/extras/1fbafd5ebfc5e618b95081e6040f13b3.poster.avif?t=1628562065\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/727660/extras/1fbafd5ebfc5e618b95081e6040f13b3.webm?t=1628562065\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/727660/extras/1fbafd5ebfc5e618b95081e6040f13b3.mp4?t=1628562065\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Who are you? <br><br>In Eden Falling, your character is fully customizable, even beyond their appearance. Customize your hair and skin color, face, gender, clothing, age and attributes, background, and even their politics. Be warned, however, that your appearance matters and will affect those around you. Your attributes will grow and change as your character ages, so choose wisely where to spend your points.<br><br>And when it's all over for your character, the world goes on, shaped by your decisions.

As you explore the post-apocalyptic landscape, terrains, borders, and even the people you meet along the way, won't be the same.
