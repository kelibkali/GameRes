Almost everything is out of context.  A random character, word, or sentence here or there. On the other hand, trying to learn Japanese by watching anime or reading manga is overwhelming (for a beginner).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >We try to strike a balance between these two worlds.  This game strives for <strong>“Mild Immersion.”</strong>  We want to immerse you in Japanese as much as possible, but only beginner Japanese. We want you to feel confident that any Japanese that comes your way is something you’ve been taught and are capable of understanding at a basic level.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Small Step Immersion</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This game also strives for <strong>“Small Step Immersion.”</strong> We want to immerse you in Japanese one small step at a time. After learning a new hiragana, you will soon learn words spelled with that hiragana and immediately start seeing and hearing those words in dialogue and battle.  Slowly, but surely, your vocabulary and reading ability will grow as the game gently immerses you, more and more. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >We believe context, immersion, and fun are key to effective learning.
