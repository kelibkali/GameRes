Chichester 2 - Part II : No Regrets For The Future.<br><br>Whilst playing that game would be advantageous, there is a brief recap at the start of the main story.<br><br><u>The Story</u><br><br>A year previous to this story, the protagonist rescued the megalomaniacal, kleptomaniac Grendel Jinx from a near-fatal tower explosion.  After doing so, the protagonist signs a &quot;<i>Friendship Agreement</i>&quot; with her, not realising exactly how problematic - and financially ruinous - it would be.<br><br>Grendel, annoyed by the protagonist's refusal to do her homework, takes matters into her own hands in order to get everything handed in on time, so she wouldn't have to repeat a year.",
