Check it out.&quot;</i></strong><br>-Giant Bomb<br><br><strong><i>&quot;The concept is ridiculous and it took all of two minutes for me to fall in love with the arcade beat-em-up, pizza delivery game.&quot;</i></strong><br>-KnowTechie<br><br><strong><i>&quot;10/10. Pizza Titan Ultra is perfectly balanced, looks great, runs well and is hilarious. I’d love it even it it wasn’t a giant robot with a built-in pizza shop that I could make look vaguely look like a Transformer.&quot;</i></strong><br>-Game Grin<br><br><i><strong>&quot;Very strong possibility of being my game of the year.&quot;</strong></i><br>-David Janes | TheChillRoom",
