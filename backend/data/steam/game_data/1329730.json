The police receive complaints about strange people trying to bite passersby and even... rise from the dead? What is it: a new drug or a zombie virus epidemic? Only partners Rick and John can solve the new case and save law and order.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><br>Zombie Case consists of 5 new missions full of unexpected twists, tactics, gruesome action, and saving humanity from zombies.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Face a new threat - zombies. They are aggressive, attack the first person they meet, are not afraid of the sound of gunfire and do not obey the commands of the guards of the law. One bite and you become a walking corpse. So be careful and plan out your attack. Or fight your way through!<br></li><li>Your approach. Hit with butts, use electroshock, gas cannon and other available weapons. Who knows what will be the most effective weapon against zombies?<br></li><li>Explore 5 new levels of Zombie Case DLC. New unique environment, dozens of references and the opportunity to pass the task in your favorite way: thoughtfully and tactically or in the best traditions of zombie movies.<br></li><li>Fight zombies alone (with an AI partner) or in co-op with a friend.</li></ul>",
