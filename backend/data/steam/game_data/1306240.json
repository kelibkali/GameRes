    "description": "<i>Freelance Trucker: Insurance Fraud Edition</i> puts the player behind the wheel of a commercial semi-truck, and in control of the finances of the trucker himself.  Navigate dangerous roads in unique delivery jobs, with a variety of cargo types depending on the job.  Safe and timely deliveries will earn you an honest paycheck, but these payouts yield diminishing returns, and the more lucrative gigs require more expensive insurance classes.   If your delivery ends in catastrophe, you're entitled to an insurance claim, presuming you're insured.  Players can use insurance payouts to unlock increasingly dangerous delivery jobs, higher salaries, and superior insurance plans.<br><br>This game was developed in Unity 3D by Blue Banana Productions.  This is a vehicle crash simulator that will test your driving skills.  It also includes a &quot;money management&quot; system where players can monitor damages, buy insurance, and use insurance to transfer damages into cash.  Players must carefully decide when and how to &quot;commit insurance fraud&quot; by sabotaging deliveries; it is necessary for career advancement, but too much destruction early on is not sustainable.   Players are given 5 save slots for parallel trucking careers, all of which can be overwritten if players wish to start new careers in previously used slots.  <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1306240/extras/e31d41e03166f7e2928e8d39ca5f703e.poster.avif?t=1614108067\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1306240/extras/e31d41e03166f7e2928e8d39ca5f703e.webm?t=1614108067\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1306240/extras/e31d41e03166f7e2928e8d39ca5f703e.mp4?t=1614108067\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Vehicle physics are based on the Eddy's Vehicle Physics Unity 3D asset package, but modified so that players can perform aerial stunts, &quot;hydraulic hops,&quot; on-demand vehicle destruction, trailer detachment, and a &quot;lock up&quot; move similar to drifting.  Environments are semi-destructible, and most unique assets were created with Blender.  Texture and art assets were creating in the Paint Dot Net program, and audio assets with Audacity.  Inputs are managed by InControl, and support PS4 and Xbox One controllers, as well as keyboard &amp; mouse.  Next generation (PS5 and XBox Series X) controller support is still being determined, as these systems were only recently released.  Using a controller is recommended, as the button mapping is more intuitive, and driving may be easier, but a controller is not required.  <i>Freelance Trucker: Insurance Fraud Edition</i> features an original soundtrack by the Strange New Sounds studio.",
