    "description": "Open Mod is an entirely free to play, niche, tactical, extreme hardcore first person shooter with immersive aspects that may not have been seen before. <br><br>Open Mod offers a big set of features unseen in any other fps game, and overall, combined with aspects that can be found in other fps games, provides a unique and unprecedented first person experience.<br><br>Open Mod is being brought to you by only 2 developers with a great passion for FPS games. Open Mod is not a complete game but more of a demonstration of what only 2 developers could do with no decent budget, just a big passion and crazy ideas! Instead of asking you to pre-order or sell you deceptive videos of our progress, we've developed this game on the go, while being public Early Access, so you could actually download and play with the features we are showing you, instead of having to just watch them on social media. <br><br>In short, we at Hyper Gamey Studio came with this game upfront and proved to you, the player, what we could achieve and that we are capable of creating an unprecedented first person shooter, even with a low budget, and we are inviting you to imagine what we could achieve together, with your financial support!<br><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1591680/extras/50937e4b58816666ea75e89fe6f6c69c.poster.avif?t=1755521140\" width=628 height=390 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1591680/extras/50937e4b58816666ea75e89fe6f6c69c.webm?t=1755521140\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1591680/extras/50937e4b58816666ea75e89fe6f6c69c.mp4?t=1755521140\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>The gameplay should be on point. This game is addressed to players that like immersive tactical, extreme-hardcore, round-based no-respawning competitive game modes and want to get immersed fully into the battle. Our primary focus is on the Defusal (Demolition) game mode, since it's a 'standard' competitive esport game mode and we, among other objectives, want to become an esport. But our approach to it is rather harder than traditional Defusal game modes, the player has to enter a planting/defusing code manually using the numpad keys after memorizing it during the round. This, combined with the aspects of our gameplay that will be mentioned below, we believe make for an unique immersive fps tactical experience that has a real chance of becoming something. <br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1591680/extras/a2e37717bc183321fc7ffeecb88f0067.poster.avif?t=1755521140\" width=628 height=390 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1591680/extras/a2e37717bc183321fc7ffeecb88f0067.webm?t=1755521140\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1591680/extras/a2e37717bc183321fc7ffeecb88f0067.mp4?t=1755521140\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1591680/extras/4f8ff7cf330ca13e61f8593a4e5c97c4.poster.avif?t=1755521140\" width=628 height=390 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1591680/extras/4f8ff7cf330ca13e61f8593a4e5c97c4.webm?t=1755521140\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1591680/extras/4f8ff7cf330ca13e61f8593a4e5c97c4.mp4?t=1755521140\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>However, we've recently added casual PvP game modes such as Domination but made it in our own way, using the tablet to hack objectives, TDM and DM along with a PvE Zombie Wave survival game mode and a PvE Extraction style game mode with cosmetics looting so that our players can have fun on various levels, not only competitive.<br><br>We recommend watching the entire Open Mod #3 Devlog to see details about the defusal game mode, domination and the zombie wave survival game mode.

But with caution as the enemy could hear you talking if you are in their range. So when the player is in enemy area they can use the Left hand animations to communicate or the text chat from the tablet.

This should cause the players to get immersed into the battle and communicate via radio when they took somebody down, since there would be no other way of knowing how many enemies are alive unless the player calls it out via radio. There is also no hitmarker on HUD or hitmarker sound so you wont really know if you hit the opponent, enhancing the realism of the battle,<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1591680/extras/e9ddb1968cdeaed1da1b79754d755dab.poster.avif?t=1755521140\" width=614 height=144 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1591680/extras/e9ddb1968cdeaed1da1b79754d755dab.webm?t=1755521140\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1591680/extras/e9ddb1968cdeaed1da1b79754d755dab.mp4?t=1755521140\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>         - Our new mag system was rewritten from the ground, the player can carry only 4 mags per weapon, we've added a mag check system and animations and a reload type that keeps the mag so you can use it later, that takes slightly more time to perform.

We've got both dual render and non dual render scopes in-game but the non-dual render ones do not look tunnel visioned but highly realistic too, due to our shaders and our custom rendering passes allowing us to pull of non-dual render realistic scopes, almost performance-free.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1591680/extras/e8573f0dc6a1690c8964b9b4c75fa537.poster.avif?t=1755521140\" width=614 height=144 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1591680/extras/e8573f0dc6a1690c8964b9b4c75fa537.webm?t=1755521140\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1591680/extras/e8573f0dc6a1690c8964b9b4c75fa537.mp4?t=1755521140\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>         - Our controller is written from the ground with a lot of features in mind, such as a realistic leaning (click  <strong>HERE</strong> to see what we mean by that), sliding, left hand anims, left handed mode, hip aiming/point shooting, double animation sprinting with pre-sprint animations and perfect blending to aiming, realistic aiming down sight, custom IK weapon positioning, free looking, head nodding (head moves in the direction you are free looking), 4 vaulting mechanic types and more. Every action you do is seen by other players exactly as you see it in first person.

This deserves a separate paragraph because those interactions are the best interactions you've ever seen to this day! The hand actually reaches and touches the door knobs or the door locks! This system was created for Open Mod VR version but now we've managed to implement it in Open Mod PC Standalone version too! It was not easy but it is totally worth the effort! <br>        - Those doors can also be leg kicked, breached with C4 or with the battering ram (not all doors can be leg kicked, but all doors can be C4ed and Rammed)<br>        - Interacting with a hybrid scope will be done with the hand actually reaching it and toggling it! Same for flashlight or laser toggling on/off, it's done realistically, hand reaches and toggles them! You can see how that looks <strong>HERE</strong> (keep in mind the animations are just placeholders at this moment, they will be revamped very soon)<br>        - We've created Realtime map variants, where all the lights are realtime and could be destroyed by players by shooting them, or control them through light switches or turn off entire houses by turning off the main house power source.

However, there are and there will be weapon skins and attachment skins that will be paid. Player model skins will always have their color scheme (dark swat-ish blue for military and dark red-ish for terrorist team) so nobody can say that we will sell camouflage skins for player models.

Also our latest implementation of Unity's Addressables system allows us to have as much content into the game as we want, without having to load it all at the start of the game, but only when needed. With those said, we strongly believe we could add more content in time and at some point we could become the game with most customizability. We've already got 500+ skins available for a large variety of weapons and attachments, and 300+ attachments to choose from, plus individual weapon parts. Building content on top of this will eventually result in a highly populated with content game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >(click on the below banner to join Discord or use this link: )</h2><br>DO NOT FORGET!! The essence of Open Mod lies in the concept of community - we are close to our community, listening to feedback and encouraging people to express their preferences or even getting involved in any matter regarding the development of the game, as well as integrating user-made content in the game such as skins, charms, animations or even custom maps. The community functions on our Discord server Open Mod Republic; make sure you check it out to stay updated on things we have done, features that we are currently working on and plans for the future.<br><br>Additionally, in our Discord you can find a few in-game weapon and attachment 3d models that could get you started with modding right away! Show us what you got! <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1591680/extras/b950725cbfb6fda1bd19112b52755f4c.avif?t=1755521140\" width=608 height=332 /></span>",
