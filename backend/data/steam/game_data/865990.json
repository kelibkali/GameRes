    "description": "Highway Junkie is a racing game about crazy driving on open highway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRules:<br />\r\nFor 5 minutes drive as far as you can. Every meter gives you +1 point. End result multiplied by experience factor, that depends on difficulty level.<br />\r\nThe damage is deducted from the total count. The race ends if you break the car or run out of time. Get as many points as possible!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are 4 different types of physics\\difficulty level:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1) Arcade<br />\r\nDo you remember the &quot;racing&quot; on tetris? That's it, but only with better graphics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2) Semi-Arcade<br />\r\nCar is under control, however, you should keep your eyes on road.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3) Semi-Realistic<br />\r\nYou should have some kind of experience, concentration and accuracy. But, in general, the steering system will not allow you to make a mistake.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4) Realistic<br />\r\nOnly for experienced racers.  It is recommended to use analog steering (mouse or steering wheel).",
