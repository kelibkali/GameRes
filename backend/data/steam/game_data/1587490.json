And what happens when two pawns clash? These are the questions that ‘Unending War’ answers.</strong><br><br>In a fantasy setting; seven gods battle to conquer a vast and brutal world. Taking control of one of these, you must battle your way across a strategic map, securing resources, conquering locations, and building fortresses and supply depots. <br><br>Each province taken requires a chess battle, but as you’ve never played before. Supply lines determine the size of your army so that battles can be vastly uneven. More dramatic still: each time pieces collide on the board, the defending god can intercede with an arbitration, causing an rpg style battle to ensue. In these battles strategic resources can be used to devastating effect, and with enough mana, iron, and worship, a pawn might even turn back a queen!<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1587490/extras/00666209804abd7e1162edb91dd31f11.avif?t=1619072076\" width=600 height=129 /></span><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >FEATURES:</h2></strong><br>A new, three-tier strategy game with chess at its core, a strategic world-map above, and individual battles below.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>The Strategic Map</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Over 650 provinces to conquer, each upgradeable with a variety of buildings..<br></li><li>7 gods and a mixture of other enemies and AIs to battle.<br></li><li>A mixture of terrains that encourage (but not force) realistic empire sprawl patterns.<br></li><li>Different visuals depending on which god owns a province.<br></li><li>Skirmish battles to lower the supply, defence, or difficulty of a province, based on thousands of mid-game, high-level chess games.<br></li><li>Magic that can change the strategic layout of the map by raising mountains, burning forests, and more.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>The Chess Game</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>- Difficulty levels that can be scaled to match the player, meaning that you are never overwhelmed.<br></li><li>A vast range of difficulty levels from complete beginner to GM.<br></li><li>Standard Chess, Chess 960, and uneven chess games are all offered through the strategy map.<br></li><li>Each chess board tile is a unique location, offering different bonuses that can be useful during arbitrated battles.<br></li><li>A selection of overlays which show the map as a more standard chess board.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>The Arbitrated Battles</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A simple, yet effective, RPG style battle system.<br></li><li>Each different chess piece has its own health, bonuses, and cost to arbitrate.<br></li><li>Health does not recover after battles allowing several smaller pieces to coordinate to take down a larger one.<br></li><li>Strategic resources can turn the tide of battles with spells, insights, and constructions.<br></li><li>Not every chess encounter can be arbitrated, resources gained from the strategy map need to be conserved for critical encounters.</li></ul>",
