    "description": "&quot;Asmodee Digital has done a great job with their virtual board game releases, and Onirim is one of their fantastic new releases!&quot;  - App Advice<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Onirim is a simple and well-crafted adaptation of a solitaire game&quot; - Board Game Quest <br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Asmodee is very good at making modern and well thought out board games for mobile. Onirim is no exception, with a rejuvenation of the solitaire card game that is simply perfect on your phone.&quot; - Pocket Gamer<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNominated for a Golden Geek in the Best Solo Board Game category, Onirim is a card game where you play as a dream walker, lost in a mysterious labyrinth. You must find the dream doors before the dream time runs out, or you will be trapped forever!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWill you wander around the dream chambers hoping that luck will reveal the doors, or will you meticulously explore each room type?  Either way, you'll have to avoid the traps of the dreaded nightmares that haunt the labyrinth's corridors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnirim is a solitaire card game. You must beat the game by collecting all eight dream doors before you run out of cards. You can get them by playing cards of the same colour for three consecutive turns or by discarding one of your precious Key cards when you draw a Door card. In both cases, you will need to make the best use of the cards you have in your hand while paying attention to the Nightmare cards. These cards are mixed in with the others, and if you draw one, you will be faced with a painful choice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to single player play, Onirim offers players an intuitive interface, automatic deck management and statistics that measure progress and success.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnirim includes the following elements: <br />\r\n- Shadi Torbey's Onirim base game in solo mode<br />\r\n- The original illustrations of the base game by Philippe Guerin and Élise Plessis, with animations<br />\r\n- A solo game mode<br />\r\n- A detailed interactive turn-by-turn tutorial integrated into the game<br />\r\n- Statistics recorded offline to allow you to see your progress<br />\r\n- No purchases or ads in the application<br />\r\n- Supported languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor more information, visit https://inpatience.com/en/Our_Games-7-ONIRIM<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA problem, need help?
