    "description": "Match up reaction stones with one another to form contiguous molecules! When a reaction stone has no empty reaction site, the molecule disappears, flushing in stones and molecules around it. A particularly clever player might use this as an opportunity to chain reactions together, destroying as many stones with as little input as possible. In the included puzzles, this may be necessary for some that limit your opportunity to move and rotate stones. Also included is an endless mode, where a never ending barrage of stones insists that you prevent the grid from filling up while also trying to beat your own records.",
