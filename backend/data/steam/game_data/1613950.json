Sometimes you need territorial control, in which case Silver Needle's fast-but-fragile assassins are your key to victory.

Maybe you need to fully disable the enemy for a turn, in which case you should strike hard with Chamomile's sleep-inducing brews.<br><br>There are multiple paths to success in this game, and no single strategy will work throughout all levels in the title. Ultimately, it's up to your judgment to lead the Tea Realms to glory against the Coffee Empire.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story</h2><br><i>Before the Old War, there lived two factions: the Tea Princesses and the Coffee Regents. The Tea Princesses chose to rule their realms separately, allowing each princess to govern by her own virtue... but the Coffee Regents chose to unify their lands, forming the great and terrible Coffee Empire. The most eminent regent, the Coffee Emperor, rose mighty armies and waged blind conquest across the continent. Their domains now splintered and on the brink, the Tea Princesses must embark on a quest to reclaim their homelands...</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Characters and Levels</h2><br>There are 12 playable Tea Princesses in the game that you can recruit, divided into 4 teams: White Teas, Green Teas, Herbal Teas, and Black Teas.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1613950/extras/9d5d2150f28ac04ac118a9d521caeea6.avif?t=1762363039\" width=620 height=1050 /></span><br><br>The game features a total of 25 replayable levels.
