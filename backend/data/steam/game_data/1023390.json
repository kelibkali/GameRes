Build villages and towns anywhere on this 20 km island as you expand your influence and power. Assign different roles and tasks to your villagers in order to make your people grow and thrive. Explore the island and it's many mysteries as you complete quests, missions, play games and puzzles.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Build</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Place buildings, structures and objects then instruct your people to build!

You can pick up trees for resources. Rocks for throwing. People for performing tasks (and throwing!). It is a very large island with a lot of places to explore and interact with. You can just build towns for hours or you can mess around and cause chaos. I will try to polish this game as soon as possible. It is very big undertaking and I would like to do this right!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i><strong>Info and screenshots are subject to change during the alpha.
