    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >   Interface Zero 3.0 Players Guide to 2095</h2>The year is 2095. The world has been ravaged by global warming, subjected to the horrors of nuclear war and natural disaster. In East Asia, the Bear and the Dragon battle for control of the resource-rich continent, and an emergent A.I. known only as Charon has destabilized the whole of Europe, sparking revolution and chaos not seen since the Second World War.<br>On the North American continent, the North American Coalition has retaken the majority of the United States, waging the Reclamation War and reforming the nation in its image. Only Texas and the walled city of Chicago stand independent of its control. Now, the masses struggle to adapt to draconian laws and avoid the indoctrination centers that have sprung up in every major city.<br>On a brighter note, perhaps, science has hacked the genome, unlocking the secrets of DNA to facilitate the creation of new breeds of human: genetic hybrids, &quot;human 2.0,&quot; and even<br><i>   simulacrum</i>   -- a slave race grown in amniotic vats and sold on the open market. Cybernetic technology has reached the point where those with the money, and the will to do so, can become living machines. Computer science has grown by leaps and bounds as well.<br>Dubbed &quot;Interface Zero&quot; by those who created it, the Tendril Access Processor, or TAP, downloads the Global DataNet and Hyper Reality directly into the minds of billions of users across the solar system, bringing the world an unparalleled level of interconnectivity, and danger. Malware plagues the Deep, however, and hackers manipulate the Tendril Access Processor to upload malicious virii, steal secrets, and even take over the identities of the unwary.<br>This is the world in 2095, omae.
