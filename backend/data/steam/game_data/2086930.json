    "description": "Brain Syndrome VR is a FPS, cell shaded, bullet hell game that can be played single player or local multiplayer. You can play the game in either VR (the recommended way) or just as a standard fps game if you so chose. The local multiplayer works by allowing the VR player and the PC player to play at the same time. To join in on PC, simply push enter on the keyboard. The full game contains over 12 levels, an assortment of 7 weapons, and loads of enemies. For more info visit https://www.brainsyndromevr.com/<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe demo only includes the first two levels, but you can purchase the rest of the game for no more than 12 dollars.",
