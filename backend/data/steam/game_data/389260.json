You explore an artistically designed surrounding with a completely new concept, defining and navigating your avatar in a distinctive way, using hand motion controllers. You float and fly as a bodyless consciousness with two ghost-like arms.<br><br>[ Windows MR headsets &amp; Index controllers are NOT supported atm !!

Lucid Trips is based on an experimental locomotion concept which can cause discomfort for some people. There is a comfort level which you can turn up and down by clicking right and left on the touchpad. 7 is maximum comfort with max particles in your view and vignette reaction. If you use Rift please steer to either site and press the thumb button to change the comfort level. Max recommended playtime for beginners 15 min.<br><br>2.) Since this is a 'sitting experience' Steam VR will fade out the Chaperone automatically after some seconds.Please be aware of this when playing standing.<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>v.06<br><br>Known bugs:<br><br>When creating challenges for other players this mode still has some bugs. Hiding gems sometimes won’t work properly. (f.e. No gems in Inventory, no “place here” area projected) <br><br>If you haven’t recentered yourself with pressing and holding the menu button the game menu sometimes shows up with a wrong orientation to you. Please always recenter first. <br><br>Slightly decreased performance when using Oculus Rift &amp; Touch via Steam compared to HTC Vive.<br><br>Some physic bugs/anomalies.<br><br>Occasionally crashes in SteamVR menu if Vive camera is activated.<br><br>The Chaperone disappears when using Vive with a sitting or standing experience. We show a warning every time you recenter so you remember and make sure you avoid hurting yourself or your hardware. (This is not a bug)",
