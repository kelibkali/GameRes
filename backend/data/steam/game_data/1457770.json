    "description": "The <strong>Mars Horizon Soundtrack</strong> has been crafted to convey the full breadth of human emotion evoked by mankind’s most ambitious expeditions. It explores and celebrates the moments of epic challenge and historic triumph that players will experience.<br><br>Enjoy a range of tracks, some of which are quiet and tender melodies that prompt you to reflect on the choices you've made. Other tracks build up to thunderous, jubilant soundscapes to accompany those moments when players take on the seemingly insurmountable odds of space exploration.<br><br>The album contains bonus material and rearrangements not included in the game, totaling 13 tracks in all.<br><br><strong>Mars Horizon</strong>’s original score is by <strong>Matthew Walker</strong> of the <strong>Auroch Digital</strong> development team. Stylistically, Walker combines organic and synthetic sounds, weaving orchestra beside synthesizer and incorporating elements of both Minimalism and Romantica.",
