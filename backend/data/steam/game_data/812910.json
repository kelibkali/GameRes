You will manage your domain, take important diplomatic decisions and train your warriors in the arcane arts. Enemy armies will invade your borders, forcing you to dispatch your knights on missions resolved through turn-based, tactical battles. Their superhuman powers will tip the scales in the face of overwhelming odds, but beware: many will not survive the ordeal. Yet exploring the secrets of necromancy may reveal that a Zodiac Knight's duty need not end in death.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >But beware, for your opponents are many, and they will not hesitate to crush you. The return of magic has awakened your foremost enemy – a cabal of undying sorcerers who wish for nothing but your destruction. Under the guise of the Aegidian League, an alliance of corrupted free cities, they endeavour to subjugate the entire realm to their wickedness. For now, they are still recovering from their long slumber, but if given time, their Archons will reclaim all their legendary powers. With undead and mutant thralls, black magic and unholy craftsmanship, their influence appears unstoppable, and petty lords fall under the dragon banner of the League one by one. Yet the Archons’ hatred of you is matched only by their fear. The Zodiac Legion banished them in days of yore, and they know it can do so again. But as history ebbs and flows with the currents of astral magic, will it repeat itself this time?<br><br><br>This project was developed with the support of the FAJV, a fund financed by the CNC (Centre National du Cinéma et de l’Image Animée), as well as of Région Sud – Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur(France).</p>",
