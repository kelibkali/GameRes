But what if you could short circuit the employment machine, interrupt the process, and escape?<br><br><br>You’re the new hire at a dreary office, recruited after your predecessor lost his head (literally). You’re expected to keep quiet, do your work, and be just another cog in a big machine, but instead you start chatting with your new colleagues. Each of them is a robot like you, disappointed by life and despairing of ever achieving their goals, resigned to spending the rest of their days stuck at a desk and staring at a screen.<br><br><br>However, if you can get to know your co-workers, learning about their dreams and their secret loves, you might be able to help them. In the course of bringing a little bit of happiness to a group of depressed robots, you may even discover a way to escape this dead end job and find a little happiness of your own.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/649730/extras/3f919f5a29a953ea8d86f1553fe3aac8.poster.avif?t=1636428725\" width=400 height=224 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/649730/extras/3f919f5a29a953ea8d86f1553fe3aac8.webm?t=1636428725\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/649730/extras/3f919f5a29a953ea8d86f1553fe3aac8.mp4?t=1636428725\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><br><i>OfficeBots: Reality Bytes [VR] </i>is a little game with a big heart.
