So don't forget that after you've launched your horse it will slowly be pulled back to where it started.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You will use your mouse to guide your horse through holes in the wall that approach you faster and faster. The holes will get smaller and farther apart as you pass through them. You don't have to make it through a hole cleanly, but think about how impressive it would be if you did.
