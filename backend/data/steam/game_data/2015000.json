Uncover the truth and forge alliances with soldiers, peasants, bandits, anarchists, and demons!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>The Ghost and the Golem</i> is an interactive historical fantasy novel by Benjamin Rosenbaum. It's entirely text-based, 450,000 words and hundreds of choices, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Nebula Award Finalist</strong> for Best Game Writing in the 60th Annual Nebula Awards!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The year is 1881. Life in your village on the border of Poland and Ukraine is sweet as raisin pastries and bitter as horseradish. Matchmakers arrange marriages and klezmer musicians play at the weddings; friends reconcile after feuds and gossip about their neighbors; people pray in the little synagogue and study holy texts. But it is a tense time in the Russian empire, with antisemitic riots spreading across the land.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >And inside your pocket is a magic amulet, revealing visions of the future, omens of your village in flames. When you hold it, you can see the blood and the bodies, smell the gunshots, and hear the marching songs. (Is that Russian? Or Ukrainian? You hear shouting in Polish.)</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >How could this future come to pass, and how will you stop it?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You'll need allies. Can you sway the local Christian peasants or the Czarist garrison to protect your village from harm? What about the bandits and anarchists lurking in the wild forest? When a demonic sheyd offers you a bargain, what will you do to save the ones you love?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Or, there may be another answer. One of your closest friends has built a golem, a hulking clay creature stronger than a dozen soldiers, waiting to be animated with a forbidden power, a secret name. Will you breathe life into the golem? If you do, will it help to defend your village, or help to destroy it?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Or perhaps the amulet's previous owner can help you. He was exiled from the academy for studying forbidden texts—for delving into mysteries he was far too young and unstable to understand, and now he's missing. Can you find him? Can you harness the powers he unleashed? Does he know a secret name?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >• Nebula Award Finalist for Best Game Writing in the 60th Annual Nebula Awards</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >• Play as male, female, or nonbinary; cis or trans; intersex or not; gay, straight, bi, or asexual.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >• Accept an arranged marriage and make your Mamma happy—and maybe yourself, too!
