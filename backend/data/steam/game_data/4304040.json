    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >✈️ <strong>Talk Fast Land Safe</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A routine flight turns into a fight for survival when critical systems begin to fail mid-air. Flashing warnings, cryptic puzzles, and an unforgiving countdown leave you with only one way out: <strong>communication</strong>.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Mayday Protocol</strong> is an asymmetric co-op puzzle game where communication is everything. <br>One player takes the role of the Pilot, facing a cockpit full of puzzles with no idea how to solve them. The other players become Co-Pilots, holding a manual that contains all the answers but they can’t see the cockpit.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Pilot describes what they see. The Co-Pilots make sense of it. <br>Solve the puzzles before time runs out and the plane survives. Fail… and the outcome is inevitable.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Only the Pilot needs to own the game;</strong> Co-Pilots can join using the free manual.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4304040/extras/e067b574704cdabe919aa4f427af130a.avif?t=1771785580\" width=1500 height=480 /></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🧠 <strong>How It Works</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Pilot sits in a cockpit filled with real flight instruments: gauges, warning lights, and screens displaying puzzles that must be solved. These screens are packed with locked systems, input-hungry controls, and visual clues that demand careful interpretation. Each one corresponds to a solution found in the Co-Pilots’ manual.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Co-Pilots read the rules and solutions, but must guide the Pilot without ever seeing what’s on screen.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Your only tool is your voice. Describe, interpret, instruct, and execute.<strong> Under pressure, against the clock</strong>.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4304040/extras/0fc4d237b084ac6f74eafdc4e8f9b949.avif?t=1771785580\" width=1500 height=360 /></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >⏱️ <strong>The Challenge</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Every level presents a sequence of puzzles that must be solved before time runs out. <br>Make too many mistakes? The plane crashes. <br>Run out of time? The plane crashes. <br>Stop communicating? You already know what happens.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Real flight instruments, constant tension, and the looming threat of disaster make every second count. From color sequences and frequency tuning to grids and shape-based systems, each level demands flawless teamwork. Time is your enemy. Stay calm, stay focused, and don’t lose the signal.</p>",
