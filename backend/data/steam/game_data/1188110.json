    "description": "Newly hatched from an egg, our young dragon searches for the important things in life. And to a dragon, that means treasure! Search underground mazes and solve elaborate puzzles in your quest for gems, and see if you can hoard enough to impress the other dragons!<br><br>A classic puzzle challenge, featuring over a hundred levels and many different objects including treasure chests, replicators, floating balloons, fire beams, thieving elves, conveyor belts, gravity switches, and many more! Between all these traps, the levels require a good mixture of reflex action and thoughtful planning; and the varied mechanics keep things interesting to solve.<br><br>The puzzles are fair: no luck-based puzzles, no searching for walls you can walk through, and all time limits are optional. Finally, a powerful level editor lets you make your own levels and share them on the Steam workshop.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><i>&quot;One of, if not the best puzzle game ever ... It's definetely worth a try for any puzzle fan.&quot;</i> - <br></li><li><i>&quot;Exciting and relaxing at the same time, SubTerra is guaranteed to provide you with many hours of pure enjoyment.&quot;</i> - Home of the Underdogs<br></li><li>Featured on television by Locomotion.</li></ul>",
