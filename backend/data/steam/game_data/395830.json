You are a police officer  transferred to a particularly crime ridden section of city-block 303. The only inhabitants of note in your jurisdiction are other low-fi, and the human intelligence (or lower) artificial life forms who have remained among the citizens after the AI singularity. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395830/extras/14ec159db53448a54afca6f229431c3d.avif?t=1763771280\" width=600 height=84 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >LOW-Fi is a new kind of experience designed from the ground up for VR but playable in standard desktop mode and on Steam Deck as well. More akin to a holodeck program than a traditional game, this massive open world simulation, leaves it up to you as the player as to what you want to do. City-block 303 and the surrounding wastelands are a completely non-linear world. You can patrol the skies handing out tickets, hang out in the arcade and play games, or try your luck at the casino. How you earn and spend your credits is entirely up to you.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >There are tons of upgrades to purchase, from weapon upgrades, and toys for you and your companions, to decorations for your cruiser and apartment(s). We want you to roam the world and enjoy yourself the way you want to.
