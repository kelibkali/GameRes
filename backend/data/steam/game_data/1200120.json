Mythopia Studios is committed to making a fun, re-playable experience that is challenging and enjoyable.   Armorgeddon was originally based on a paper and pencil turn based game.  The idea blossomed into a hex board game, but we wanted to take that concept one step further and bring it to life in 3D.",
