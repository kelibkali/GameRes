For ages, the Elder Dragons have both sustained and blighted Tyria in a cycle that maintains the balance of magic. Now that cycle is collapsing, and only two Elder Dragons still live: Aurene, who shoulders the legacy of every dragon before her; and the elusive Deep Sea Dragon, whose motives and origin are a mystery. Mortal hearts and choices will define this moment in history—and echo into the future forever.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Explore four new maps across the continent of Cantha, customize your character with nine new elite specializations, collect new weapon and armor skins, and more!</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2008610/extras/81df2e6d1346c6d18a3c0c915fc06ab8.poster.avif?t=1770751271\" width=624 height=150 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2008610/extras/81df2e6d1346c6d18a3c0c915fc06ab8.webm?t=1770751271\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2008610/extras/81df2e6d1346c6d18a3c0c915fc06ab8.mp4?t=1770751271\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>The multiplayer Siege Turtle can bear two riders: one to handle the turtle, and another to operate the weapons strapped to its shell.
