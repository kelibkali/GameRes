You can do it with perks. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Real-time battles with big warbands and big consequences: NovaMundi has a satisfying combat system in which you can battle many different units against big enemy groups. Battle several dozen Muisca warriors of several classes, archers, and beasts against Panche raiders and Spanish invaders. Face archers against melee fighters and protect your frontline using guardians. Each individual is unique; if wounded they will need several days to heal, and if they die… There is no escape from the cold embrace of death. </p></li></ul>",
