    "description": "Welcome to Crest, a unique take on the traditional god sim, where your word is gospel. Control and guide your followers by issuing commandments written in an evolving pictographic language.<br><br>How these commandments are interpreted and remembered is not set in stone. What you communicate and what experiences your followers have with the environment is the basis for their religion. Over time, commandments can develop different associations and completely change their meaning. After all, your followers still have free will and will sometimes do what they think is best for them, regardless of what you had in mind.<br><br>The consequences of your actions may not always be clear and you will need to be aware of the ever-changing environment, your people's beliefs and their feelings about you. <br><br>Will they love, respect or fear you?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Create your own religion</strong>, nurture your followers and observe how they evolve, or die, as a result of your decisions - including the unintended consequences of your commands! <br><br></li><li><strong>Sandbox-style gameplay</strong>: Oversee a world where weather, vegetation, mineral deposits, drought and animal behavior will create surprises<br><br></li><li><strong>Weave your own stories</strong> through trial and error.

Its focus is on replayability. Every new world you start is unique and will write its own stories. If all your followers die, that world is gone forever. However, you will still be able to view the legacy of your previous worlds. As long as your people live you can continue playing and further shape your own history by creating more and more complex commandments with newly unlocked words.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/341710/extras/e13a848e2db192756c8e50f1a7ec68a6.poster.avif?t=1723620926\" width=600 height=178 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/341710/extras/e13a848e2db192756c8e50f1a7ec68a6.webm?t=1723620926\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/341710/extras/e13a848e2db192756c8e50f1a7ec68a6.mp4?t=1723620926\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
