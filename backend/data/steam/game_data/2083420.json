Although the place will seem empty at first, it will quickly become clear that you are not alone, and are being stalked by a shy entity that is determined to catch you.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2083420/extras/3.gif?t=1665003328\" /></span><br><br>When the entity is stalking you, an indicator will appear on the screen informing you that you are being watched. This means that somewhere around you, Egghead Gumpty is looking straight at you. It could be him peeking from behind a door or from the ceiling, but that doesn’t matter. What matters is that you must find where Egghead Gumpty is stalking you before it gathers enough confidence to attack, and scare it away to buy yourself time to dedicate to your mission.<br><br><br>",
