    "description": "Evil US government invades Mother Russia. To lurk that fact from the world the politicians did not force American people fight, but sent made of garbage war machines instead.<br><br>Cities are on fire, citizens have been destroyed or ran away. But there is still a slight chance to change the outcome of this war.<br><br>A man from a ghetto. Sport suit, classic shoes, a cap. In the world of procedurally generated robots he possesses a gun, an AK-47, a bazooka, and an insatiable thirst for enemy blood. Or machine oil in this case. <br><br>The hero we deserve. Actually, he's the only one we've got, so there is no need for complaining. The man is here to say one thing to those mechanical bastards: &quot;This Russia is mine&quot;.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Side-scroller, platformer, shoot'em up, 2.5D twin-stick shooter<br></li><li> Generated levels and enemies<br></li><li> The entire gameplay is shooting. A lot. It's pretty relaxing actually<br></li><li> More is coming during Early Access...</li></ul>",
