It's heavily inspired by other Japanese horror RPGs such as Ib and The Witch's House, and was designed very much so to mimic the feel of older RPGMaker games. While not as unforgiving as some of its inspirations, death *is* in its design, so make sure to save often! <br><br>The story of Dear Brother takes place in the childhood home of a character named Audrey, who had decided to return home after finishing her studies. However, after waking up from a nap, strange things begin to happen around her... Audrey can't make out whether the events she's experiencing are hallucinations or memories. She knows she's forgetting something, but she doesn't know what.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1629320/extras/294491d65da3330297f94260afde9189.poster.avif?t=1720809500\" width=616 height=148 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1629320/extras/294491d65da3330297f94260afde9189.webm?t=1720809500\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1629320/extras/294491d65da3330297f94260afde9189.mp4?t=1720809500\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Explore and solve puzzles in an atmospheric horror setting<br></li><li>Collect hidden mementos to unlock a secret ending<br></li><li>Examinining objects around you may reveal more about the story<br></li><li>Several Steam achievements to be unlocked<br></li><li>Controller support has been added as of 31 May, 2022!</li></ul><br><i>Dear brother uses some sound effect samples from Freesound.
