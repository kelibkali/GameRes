    "description": "<i>Have you ever heard about the Toymaker?</i><br><br>This is the free Prologue for Toymaker. Featuring a stand-alone story, expanding on the game's world, that gives a small taste of what the full game is like.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story</h2><br>In this prologue you take on the role of Baldor, a trapper, and guardian of your tribe. When you were a child, you and another boy played too close to the forbidden Field of candles. There, something came out, and took the other boy, leaving you behind with nightmares and a silent obligation to guard your people.<br><br>But lately strange things have started to happen. Dangerous flesh-eating animals are coming closer and closer to the village.<br><br>The midwinter night draws ever nearer, with a cold darkness that seems to follow your every move.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/618110/extras/7e60ed3798bcad9435fc52cd6240afe0.avif?t=1491591630\" width=450 height=70 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Traverse a dark, twisted world unlike anything you’ve ever played before, where you can meet crafty gnomes and proud reindeer.<br></li><li>10+ hours of dynamic, ever-changing story, with much more to explore outside the well-traveled paths. (2+ in this Prologue.)<br></li><li>Fight weird things created from darkness and light, in a place where healing is never fast and wounds take a long time to mend.<br></li><li>Choose classes for your followers, to complement their strengths or to battle their weaknesses.<br></li><li>Make choices that influence the people in this world. Everyone can die, even you. Every path affects your characters, shaping their story and twisting the game.<br></li><li>How much will you sacrifice to see the end of your journey?</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/618110/extras/68fb28f2cb65d230a15635b79b1e2dff.avif?t=1491591630\" width=488 height=70 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >End</h2><br>This game is a three year long labour of love. Everything is handcrafted, from graphics, to design and music. Hopefully you will enjoy the result.<br><br>Toymaker uses the classic RPG maker 2003 engine as the stone to carve its saga on. Polishing and breaking it, until something unique was made.<br><br>Thank you for your time.",
