With full control of the ride's motion, you can offer a unique journey every ride.<br><br>Watch out for the safety of your guests! Make sure the loading and unloading gates are properly close, all the restraints are locked and checked and make sure the intensity of the ride is not set to &quot;astronaut's training program&quot; or you might find an unpleasant surprise on the floor from one or more of your guests that you will have to take care of.<br><br>As in real life, weather will play an important factor in some rides. High speed winds could endanger the safety of your riders so the ride's computer will shut down the system if the meteorology makes impossible to operate the ride safely.<br><br>Are you up for the challenge? Explore the different game modes and complete all your duties in the time given to earn experience points. Don't make the guests wait too much in the queue or they could start to run out of Instagram photos to like on their phones and start complaining!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/699770/extras/17f9275a0dd5516a6143e8ddfba1b362.webp?t=1742474554\" width=500 height=28 /></span><br><br>-<i>Fully modelled rides</i> with loading/unloading platforms, entry queue and a fully functional control cabin with the ride's operation panel.<br><br>-<i>Highly detailed guests</i> to ride your thrilling machines with many different animations and reactions.<br><br>-<i>Realistic environment</i> to immerse yourself even more.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/699770/extras/678dfced9e8db83f267fa1b137f18eb2.webp?t=1742474554\" width=500 height=28 /></span><br>  <br>-<i>Sandbox:</i> Where you can explore the ride controls without a time pressure, perfect for beginners and people who want to enjoy every part of the ride experience.<br><br>-<i>Challenge:</i> Do you think you can complete all the tasks on time?
