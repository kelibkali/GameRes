    "description": "Studies have found that when people do things for profit, the results are not as good as when they do it for fun. the theory is because they are more focused on &quot;getting the money&quot;.<br>​<br>​Loren and I(Nick) both experienced this first hand with our first project together. that's why we decided to try something different.<br>​<br>We will release our games and all there content for free for as long as we can. Our hope is that people enjoy what we are creating and decide to support us so we can keep doing it.<br>​<br>​After all, we want to make games, not products. <br><br>If you enjoyed Space Raiders in space and want to support Loren and I so we can keep making games, consider buying us this beer.<br><br><strong><u>This DLC does not add any gameplay content. It will unlock a cool sticker on the main screen, though.</u></strong>",
