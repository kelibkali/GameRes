    "description": "Axes and Acres is a deep and engaging single-player strategy game designed to create exciting decisions every turn. Axes and Acres includes elements of deck-building which allow you to strategically manage your peasants to farm, build, and survive. The rules are easy to learn, but every turn can be played out in many different ways, leading to complex and interesting choices.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/448910/extras/18956782a483a2ca3868cc14c7ecdddb.avif?t=1471227681\" width=600 height=100 /></span></h2><br>In Axes and Acres you are the lord of a small but rich plot of land (and a couple smelly peasants). These peasants are represented by dice and can Build, Work, Gather Resources, and Reproduce, depending on their mood. Using a combination of your burgeoning population and &quot;motivation&quot; cards, you will build, chop, cultivate and plot to produce a thriving village!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/448910/extras/1504f627659ea530fe3caaedb8ecb793.avif?t=1471227681\" width=600 height=100 /></span></h2><br>In Axes and Acres both your workers and your motivations can be improved and changed, all within one game. Each play-through is discrete, every decision is difficult and interesting, and there are tons of decisions - making every minute of gameplay valuable. Axes and Acres will test your strategic and tactical skills while providing a rewarding and fun experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/448910/extras/696f40e5ea3b2fe8d46faaa32e59932d.avif?t=1471227681\" width=600 height=100 /></span></h2><br>Axes and Acres is the second game from BrainGoodGames, the creators of the well-received single player strategy game Militia.
