    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >D&amp;D Classics: FRQ1 Haunted Halls of Eveningstar</h2>Welcome to the picturesque village of Eveningstar, nestled at the foot of the Stonelands where the River Starwater winds down a gorge and snakes into the King's Forest. Here, the Knights of Myth Drannor began their famous adventures. Here, the Ladies of the Brazen Blade, The Company of the Singing Sword, The Steel Shield Band, and many other came, clutching royal charters from King Azoun with the ink scarcely dry on the parchment. Some fell, some went on to greatness-but they all came here first; to the Haunted Halls.<br>Despite numerous infiltrations, the Halls have not yet yielded all their secrets or treasures. Many dangers lurk as deadly as ever in dark chambers herein, awaiting new companies of eager-eyed adventurers.<br>Is it your turn to dare The Haunted Halls? Many come, but few survive to again see Eveningstar's beauty.<br>Welcome, then. Enter in, and find in these pages:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A challenging introductory level dungeon.<br></li><li>A detailed countryside setting, including important local personages, local color, and guidelines for play. Suggested campaign plots and adventures.<br></li><li>New spells.<br></li><li>New magical items.<br></li><li>New monsters.</li></ul>A splendid campaign can begin here. Adventurers in an ongoing campaign can stop by for a memorable visit. Those looking for an underground stronghold may even find a home in the Haunted Halls of Eveningstar.<br><strong><br><i> We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today.
