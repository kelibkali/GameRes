    "description": "The Lloyd's Register Foundation Heritage &amp; Education Centre wants to inspire the next generation of maritime surveyors and engineers in an innovative and engaging way. Our vision is to allow visitors to learn about the importance of surveyor roles and how they’ve evolved over time as maritime engineering has progressed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom that vision we’ve created ‘Ship Surveyor Through the Ages’; a gamified VR learning experience that will immerse you in simulated environments and challenge you to take on the varied roles of a surveyor across key eras of maritime engineering. You will undertake key tasks that surveyors would perform in three types of vessel construction: wood, composite and contemporary. Will you be able to locate all hazards and faults on-board the vessels before your time runs out? Anchors aweigh!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n‘Ship Surveyor Through the Ages’ lets you:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n•\tTravel back in time through different eras of maritime vessel construction<br />\r\n•\tExplore three unique, stunning ships in breath-taking VR<br />\r\n•\tLearn how the role of surveyors has evolved as new ship-building methods were introduced<br />\r\n•\tComplete key tasks, which surveyors would usually undertake, against the clock",
