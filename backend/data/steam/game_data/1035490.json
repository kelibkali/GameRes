Death by dormant magic. It has no cure. People fall ill to it, and eventually die within a year. You know there will be no hope for you if you give in to the sickness. And so you came to the Tomb of Senza, in the mountainous lands of Dokia, to find out how to end the miasma...<br><br>Know that you are not the only one involved in this struggle. The Naga Cult is onto you. The Pilgrims cannot help you yet. And the locals are too scattered and wary to stand their ground against all the monstrosities in Dokia.
