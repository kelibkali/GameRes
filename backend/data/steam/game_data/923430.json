    "description": "You are trapped in a maximum security prison. Fortunately, you are not like the other inmates. Use your powers to manipulate space time at your will. It slows down time and runs longer than the bullets themselves. Open portals to travel to previous places. If you stumble, go back in time and try again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere will be someone who will try to stop you, but your determination will get you through any difficulty. Neither the strongest lock can stop the will<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Pit is a platform game with touches of action and puzzles, which will force you to understand and know how to use all the skills you have.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt The Pit we want to bring the feeling of classic games, taking advantage of new technologies. With a careful style that tries to simulate the feeling that those games gave off.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith this game I try to write a love letter to the games. My passion since my childhood and try to transport it to players, whether young or old school.",
