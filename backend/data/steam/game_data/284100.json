Centuries after planetfall, colonists are still struggling to gain foothold on their lush and alien planet. You settle on the frontier by carefully managing resources, production and different personalities.<br>Characters and alien wildlife are brought to life through a rigorous simulation and the game plays out as a tug-of-war between humans and nature on a planet full of opportunities and dangers. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/284100/extras/797b375bbcb07d582c0aca33ed59419f.avif?t=1487698153\" width=560 height=140 /></span><br><br><strong>Features</strong><br>Indirect control -- the colonists are free and have a democratic society.

Humans landed on a Tau Ceti planet in 2238 after a 100 year journey. Over the generations, the Tau Ceti colonists lost the advanced equipment which was brought to the planet and the descendants formed simple frontier societies based on farming, fishing and trade.<br><br>----------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Open-ended maps and scenarios</strong><br>In various scenarios and maps we explore the history of the planet's colonization. The tutorials and scenarios introduce you to the game's setting and mechanics and make you ready to tackle the open-ended maps where you build up a colony from scratch.<br><br><i>Fields of Tau Ceti</i> are open-ended maps that take place in a primitive future centuries after planetfall. You begin with a community equipped for either hunting, farming or fishing and work off the land.
