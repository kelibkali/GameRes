You’re not bothered about the story; you just want to blow stuff up? Then look no further! Super Mega Space Blaster Special Turbo should be right up your street.<br><br><br>Super Mega Space Blaster Special Turbo is a retro inspired space blaster with loads of challenges and things to unlock. If you are thinking of buying the game please keep in mind that the game was made for Bare Knuckle Development by just one person, Ste Wilson. Don’t expect a ‘triple A’ experience, an in-depth story, or mind-blowing graphics. What the game offers is a simple retro-inspired space shooter with a focus on core-gameplay that will challenge you. The game has loads of challenges to keep you playing and lots of ships and upgrades to unlock to keep the gameplay feeling fresh and give you a sense of achievement and progression. All this is available for the same price as a grande salted caramel mocha frappuccino.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/748330/extras/fc5136ac51815151c45c051934bdf1e3.poster.avif?t=1768073257\" width=616 height=336 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/748330/extras/fc5136ac51815151c45c051934bdf1e3.webm?t=1768073257\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/748330/extras/fc5136ac51815151c45c051934bdf1e3.mp4?t=1768073257\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>If you have any questions, problems, or feedback about the game just give us a shout.

Super Mega Space Blaster Special Turbo was made by only one of us, Ste Wilson as a solo dev project. After the success of Super Mega Space Blaster Special we decided to make a massively expanded 'Turbo Edition' whilst still continuing the development of our much bigger metroidvania action-RPG The Flawless: Art's Tale. Super Mega Space Blaster Special Turbo expands on the original in every area with more game modes, more space blasters, more challenges, more music, a huge shop, and loads more.<br><br>We wanted to make a shoot 'em up (shmup) that blended modern and retro mechanics to create a nostalgic yet up-to-date shooter that gives you the 'just one more go' feeling. Now you can be the judge of this, leave a Steam review and let us know what you think. We are open to feedback and want to improve the game in any way we can. If you have any issues with the game please feel free to let us know and we'll do our best to solve the problem. We hope you enjoy the game, Happy blasting!",
