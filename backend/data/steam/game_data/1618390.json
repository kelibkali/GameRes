Hopefully you will manage to build a community large enough that one day the last generation could land on a habitable planet and start their new life on the ground. But don't be too eager: Expand too fast and you might not have enough workforce to even feed the new children. Will you make the sacrifices needed to keep the voyage running or will the cold hull of the ship contain only corpses in the end?   </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The game takes inspiration from games like Banished, Rimworld and Frostpunk.
