    "description": "<strong>From]: John<br>Subject: Bubbaruka</strong><br><br>Hey, it's been a little bit!<br><br>I know it's a bit strange for me to Email you out of the blue, but I thought you'd be interested in this. You remember that old toy? The one that was supposed to be like a pet in your keychain? The one that never got released?<br><br>Well I found it.<br><br>I was just cruising around eBay, and I found a super cheap laptop for sale. The owner acted real weird, refused to take phone calls, only let me talk to him via Email. But you know, cheap product cheap service.<br><br>Turns out the laptop had something in it already, a folder called Bubbaruka.<br><br>The name jogged so many memories, I remember begging my mom to get me one for Christmas. Never knew why they didn't release them. They would've made tons.<br><br>But It's here! Seems fully functioning, just like the commercials! I didn't start much, I rushed to Email you first. I know you're into lost media, missing games, that sort of thing. This is right up your alley, right? Still, It's a bit buggy. It definitely seems unfinished, and some of the features straight up don't seem to work, but it's a fun nostalgia trip.<br><br>Welp, I'm gonna go play the game for like, 30 minutes before I get bored and forget it exists. Talk to you later!<br><br>Attached: Bubbaruka.zip<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>This is the Demo for the game Bubbaruka.
