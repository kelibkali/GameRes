    "description": "The protagonist wakes up inside a container with a lamp, a flashlight and a video surveillance point. How did he get there? Unknown. There are plenty of other containers outside. And around the darkness, in the distance you can see the walls. It all looks like someone's crazy experiment. We need to get out of this strange place! But if only it were that simple. It seems that the main character is not alone. Somewhere in the dark, something lurks...<br><br><strong>Containerphobia</strong> is a horror game in which you need to look for items on the map. Items will help the player to escape. Some of them will be able to temporarily delay the mysterious ill-wisher while you seek shelter.<br><br><strong>The main goal of the game</strong> is to get out of a large dark room with containers. And in no case should you fall into the clutches of a mysterious creature.<br><br><strong>Items.</strong> On the map you can find many different items that you can pick up. From a flashlight to useless bottles. Although... no, the bottle can be thrown, creating a noise that will definitely attract the creature's attention.<br><br><strong>VR-mode.</strong> If you have a virtual reality helmet, you can get a completely different experience. Distract the creature by tapping the containers with your fists. Throw objects as if you were doing it in real life. Wear two items at the same time.<br><br><strong>A mysterious creature.</strong> Either the consequences of a scientific experiment, or a summoned being from another world. It feels fear and likes to play hide and seek with the victim.<br><br><strong>The following mechanics are currently implemented:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Items can be picked up and interact with the environment through them. A flashlight illuminates the surrounding area, and a fire extinguisher gives a chance to escape from the creature.<br></li><li> In the container where the player spawns, there is a video surveillance point. 4 cameras are connected to it randomly scattered around the map. Cameras turn from time to time in different directions.<br></li><li> Electrical appliances go crazy if a creature is nearby.<br></li><li> At the beginning of the game, the player appears in a random container on the map.<br></li><li> The creature is very curious. It can walk up to any container and open it with its nasty hands. And if a player is inside... Only a miracle will help him.</li></ul><br>Did you like the game? Add her to your wishlist. You will be the first to know about its release.",
