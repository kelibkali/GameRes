    "description": "Death is inconsequential in this arcade-style roguelite with an artstyle inspired by early Atari consoles. But be careful with damaging the bloodied walls and floors, falling out of the level will bring you right back to the start of the stage. Blood stained walls are destructible, so be careful where you kill and die!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Early Access</h2>Currently the game has 2 stages, with 25 levels between them and a bossfight at the end of each. Estimated playtime in the game's current state is about 2 hours, however this changes dramatically based on ability in such a skill-based game.",
