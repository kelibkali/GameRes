    "description": "Fruit Postal Service is a party racing game for up to four players. Pick one of the employees of the Fruit Postal Service and use your fruity powers to deliver the mail! Whether you pick Walter Melon, Professor Sherry, Bandana-nana or Jack Apple, you'll find yourself racing against the other drivers (and the clock!) to deliver fruity packages. Grab those keys and start up your engines and show everyone else why you deserve to be employee of the month!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nControllers (PS4, Xbox) are highly recommended, but up to 2 (of 4 total) players can play on keyboard!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game was created as part of a capstone project at Northeastern University. You can learn more about the team on our website, linked here on our page!",
