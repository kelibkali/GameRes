    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Ultimate Admiral: Dreadnoughts aims to be the first game of its kind - a true naval warfare game - which offers a unique opportunity to design and build countless variations of realistic looking warships combined with an extremely in-depth and realistic combat model. We are absolutely excited with what we are making and we hope everyone who is interested about the dreadnought era and naval warfare, will join our ambitious project and support us.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >FEATURES </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>BUILD THE BATTLESHIPS THE WAY YOU WANT</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Become the architect of powerful warships, from small torpedo boats to mighty Battleships! Recreate famous ships such as the HMS Dreadnought and countless speculative designs. Pick turret layout, armor scheme, funnel placement, tower variations making each ship look and feel unique. Their hull characteristics, internal upgrade selection and weight distribution not only modifies their speed and maneuverability but also their weapon effectiveness. Every design detail of your warships has a significant effect on the combat capability of your ships.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>STRONG AI</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Naval combat becomes immersive and feels even more realistic when your opponent is able to react to your actions with a human-like and unexpected behavior. The AI evaluates the optimal engagement distance, using principles of the “Immunity Zone” and comparing its own firepower versus your ships. The AI uses ammunition wisely, holding fire when necessary or switching shell types according to the armor protection of the target. Unless there is a special mission directive, the AI will not act suicidally and will attempt to withdraw, if its fleet becomes heavily damaged or it is much weaker than yours. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>NAVAL ACADEMY &amp; CUSTOM BATTLES</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Custom Battle system allows you to experiment and enjoy naval battles utilizing endless combinations of ship designs in technology eras between the years 1890 and 1950 for ten different nations. Additionally, there is the “Naval Academy” which currently includes 63 battle scenarios, where you will have to design a ship or a squadron to fulfill a certain combat tactical task. These numerous missions will allow you to practice and enjoy the many innovative design and combat aspects of the game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>THE CAMPAIGN</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You can fully design your fleet, immerse yourself in epic naval battles and make crucial strategic decisions on the map with a single goal to defeat your opponents by annihilating their fleets and strangling their economy. The map includes necessary historical and strategic aspects that can simulate actual facts of the period 1890-1940.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Current
