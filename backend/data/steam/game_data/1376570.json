    "description": "SYNERGIA's original soundtrack - an enthralling, immersive synth-based musical experience that teleports you into the world of SYNERGIA. The soundtrack consists of 12 musical pieces, ranging from ethereal ambient pads, to hard hitting, mechanical action pieces for grimy industrial factories. This beautiful and vivid soundtrack is composed by ANDY ANDI HAN, the composer of music scores and sound designs for other games such as Katawa Shoujo, Sense: A Cyberpunk Ghost Story, Mahou Arms, and Arenus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHan's twist on electronic music genres for a cyberpunk setting creates a unique experience, and a sound unmistakably his own and Synergia's. Not just synthwave, not just ambient, but a whole that sticks in your mind - like the cyberbrain augmentation installed at the back of your neck.",
