    "description": "A world where children aren’t born—they crawl out of tunnels in the ground. A lone city, beneath the gaze of a silent god, home to strange cults who eat the dead. The Pale City is the story of a mercenary hired to find the last, most powerful artifact of a sorcerer who disappeared lifetimes ago. But the search pits him against powerful people in hidden places, towards a secret buried somewhere in terrible darkness.<br><br><strong>An Unconventional, Character-Driven Narrative: </strong><br>Written and designed by novelist Kyle Muntz, The Pale City tells the story of one man’s struggle against a merciless world and the emptiness inside himself.<br><br><strong>A Handcrafted, Semi-Open World:</strong><br>Every room has a purpose; every battle has meaning; every step you take tells you more about yourself.<br><br><strong>The Price of Survival:</strong><br>Tense, unforgiving combat that rewards close observation and careful use of skills, where defense is often more important than offense.<br><br><strong>Multiple Difficulty Levels:</strong><br>Brave normal mode to experience the brutal reality of life in a harsh world, or story mode if you'd rather focus on the game's storytelling, exploration, and lore.<br><br><strong>A Solitary Journey: </strong><br>In a city without heroes, can you bear to see the consequences of your actions?",
