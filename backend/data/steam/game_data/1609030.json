It is created for those of us, who love to hone their skills by replaying their favorite games in order to find new ways to finish them faster than everybody else. However, it's not only about quick reaction and hand-eye coordination! If you want to outperform yourself, prepare to think outside of the box and break the game rules!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1609030/extras/1acba4cee955dc351fac37810388bfa5.poster.avif?t=1752696568\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1609030/extras/1acba4cee955dc351fac37810388bfa5.webm?t=1752696568\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1609030/extras/1acba4cee955dc351fac37810388bfa5.mp4?t=1752696568\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1609030/extras/35c9b19f768e73f9bc5d913b122d4ef1.webp?t=1752696568\" width=16 height=16 /></span> The puzzle-ish nature of challenges in &quot;IT&quot; allows for multiple strategies to beat them. If you crash into a hazard, it will become deactivated and you will be teleported back to the spawn point, which can help you get where you want faster. The actions you perform (such as collecting pick-ups or destroying hazards) persist through death, but should you run out of time - the level will reset.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1609030/extras/bebb9044ff144fe6689b7eee20d0abab.poster.avif?t=1752696568\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1609030/extras/bebb9044ff144fe6689b7eee20d0abab.webm?t=1752696568\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1609030/extras/bebb9044ff144fe6689b7eee20d0abab.mp4?t=1752696568\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>If you're a seasoned speedrunner, here are a few features you're bound to fall in love with:<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1609030/extras/09abb2d14cc87c847397a327d47db8e7.webp?t=1752696568\" width=16 height=16 /></span> The respawns are instant.
