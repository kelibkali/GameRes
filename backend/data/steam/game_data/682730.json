    "description": "This is a short-time walking simulator with an open world that you can go through with your eyes closed. In the end, here you will need to rely only on your hearing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou woke up in the middle of the white, lighted room. What happened? How did I get here? These are the questions that find the main character of this game. &quot;If you want to know something, just ask about it,&quot; thought the protagonist. But instead of words from the mouth only air comes out. Suddenly, up to the hero's ears comes a voice from above. It is he who will answer all the questions that are tormenting the hero, and will also show, in a clear example, how a normal hearing test can develop into a real challenge.",
