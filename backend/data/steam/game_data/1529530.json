    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Into the Darkness VR takes full advantage of VR technology to not only tell a thrilling story that explores the effects of current technological advancement, but also allow you to fully immerse in an interactive world packed with numerous satisfying mechanics.<br><br>What to expect in Into the Darkness VR:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Story Mode:</strong> Start an immersive journey spread across six atmospheric levels. As Agent Frank, you’re briefed by CELL Industries to infiltrate a secret base called AARC located in snowy mountains, where you’ll be fighting androids, meeting new fully voiced characters and discovering secrets that lie within – all surrounded by highly interactive environments that can collapse if you take the wrong step. At the end, you might find out that not everything is as it seems at first glance.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Sandbox Mode:</strong> Experiment and have fun in a large area filled with many rooms and props, all for your freeform enjoyment. Here, you’re free to do whatever you want, including spawning as many enemies, props and weapons as your heart desires, using the many interactive areas of this level to curate your own explosive experience.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Weapons:</strong> Use a variety of guns (pistols, rifles, shotgun), melee weapons (knife, katana, crowbar) and range weapons (bow, shurikens and whatever you find). Want a bigger challenge? Engage in hand-to-hand combat or use dismembered elements of your enemies as a weapon. And if all hope fails, our environment allows you to make improvised weapons.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Enemies:</strong> Fight and dismember different classes of androids, all with different attack patterns and skills. While the low level enemies attack you with your fists, higher levels can use melee weapons and even guns, posing a challenge as you venture further into AARC. They are equipped with AI that reacts not only to your actions, but also the layout of their nearest environment.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Economy:</strong> Plan your mission and resources carefully. While fighting your enemies, you collect a resource called LUMA, which allows you to craft weapons, ammo and healing injectors called RAMP at the crafting stations spread throughout the levels. Be careful though! These crafting stations are rare and it’s not that hard to run out of ammo.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Advanced physics based combat system:</strong> We seamlessly blend IK with enemy animations to make them feel both responsive and realistic during the fights, as they react not just to your actions, but also use the environment to their advantage. More than that, you can also dismember them using hands, melee weapons and guns!</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Interactive environment:</strong> The world of Into the Darkness VR is not only filled with a wide variety of interactive objects, you can also directly influence and be influenced by your surroundings! Our levels are filled with interactive props you can grab, stack and even break. More than that, there are plenty of landscape elements that can be pushed or destroyed, or might collapse due to your actions. Our mountain levels are also covered with snow with a realistic tessellation and have slippery or windy elements that force you to think outside the box.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Features:</strong> As a special agent, you’re equipped with various features and devices to help you on your mission. At the beginning, you receive a special glove that helps you influence your surroundings and enemies, allowing you to warp gravity to push and pull, as well as use slow motion. You’re also equipped with a hacking device used to uncover CELL’s secrets and a special scanning device helpful to find your way around levels or find the weapon you’ve just accidentally dropped in the snow.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Puzzles:</strong> Besides your combat abilities, you also need to utilize your skills to solve various environmental puzzles that might block your way throughout the levels. The answers aren’t always so obvious. Whether it’s finding a missing keycard or using your reflexes to open certain doors, as Agent Frank, there’s nothing you can’t do!</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1529530/extras/4b3dccf1fd627856f1ed22300fc84f7c.poster.avif?t=1748523618\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1529530/extras/4b3dccf1fd627856f1ed22300fc84f7c.webm?t=1748523618\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1529530/extras/4b3dccf1fd627856f1ed22300fc84f7c.mp4?t=1748523618\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Become Agent Frank, a special agent sent on a delicate mission into the heart of a seemingly abandoned base where things aren’t what they seem at first glance.
