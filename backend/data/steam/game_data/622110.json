    "description": "Note: The original game, Tornuffalo is playable without body tracking, no Vive Trackers needed. If you have 3 Vive Trackers, this DLC lets you launch the game in &quot;Full-Body Action&quot; mode, so you can kick, dodge and jump with your whole body. If you have only 2 Vive Trackers you can still play and kick even though the full-body mode is optimized for 3 Trackers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Full-Body Action</h2>Clip one Vive Tracker onto your belt on your back, and strap the other two tightly onto your feet.<br><br>The body tracking isn't perfect, but it still gives an impressive effect considering the limitations.",
