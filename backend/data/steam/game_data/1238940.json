In this RPG and Visual Novel hybrid, you'll battle cute enemies alongside a colorful cast of characters, managing their energy (both physical and magical) to get the work done.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1238940/extras/99f9cebab8ae61d950ab0f0cb84da85f.poster.avif?t=1745517148\" width=660 height=364 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1238940/extras/99f9cebab8ae61d950ab0f0cb84da85f.webm?t=1745517148\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1238940/extras/99f9cebab8ae61d950ab0f0cb84da85f.mp4?t=1745517148\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story</h2>Magical girls are a specific class of worker that has spent years mastering the drawing of magic from their planet’s five moons. They use this magic to fight creatures of darkness that congregate in the no-man's-land between cities. Kotori Mori, a plucky new magical girl, hopes to find a job in one of the famous guilds of Larimar City. During a test for a guild, she and Brie Butternuggets (her animal familiar and friend) will meet Kaida Hikari and Gigi, who are on a mission of their own for the Songbird Guild.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1238940/extras/dea87f8bef7df0af6eba69163b7983b1.poster.avif?t=1745517148\" width=758 height=124 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1238940/extras/dea87f8bef7df0af6eba69163b7983b1.webm?t=1745517148\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1238940/extras/dea87f8bef7df0af6eba69163b7983b1.mp4?t=1745517148\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Characters</h2>Kotori is your typical anime protagonist.  She’s strong, sometimes reckless, and has deep ambitions that drive her every move.  Her low defense and her susceptibility to being stunned make her a bit squishy, but keep her well protected and her high attack and crit stats will give your team the firepower it needs.<br><br>Genteel, at times to the point of being stiff, Kaida is the most put together of the Songbird members.  With heavy defense and very high status resist, she’s a tank, but also hits like a wet noodle.  More complex magical abilities will need to be used sparingly, but her ability to quickly heal stamina makes her a good long-game character.<br><br>Brie is quiet and mellow, but not necessarily shy, just laid back. As the guild’s primary healer, he’s very important in the field, so make sure to protect him! While a pretty tanky character, he is weak to burns.<br><br>Gigi is a nerd on many topics, including history, magic, and technology. Once she starts talking about a subject she’s interested in, it’s hard to get her to stop. She has heavy burn resist, but low defense and is very weak to poison.<br><br><strong>And more!</strong><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1238940/extras/244fb12c34a204a08780ec83ae0b9eaa.poster.avif?t=1745517148\" width=632 height=210 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1238940/extras/244fb12c34a204a08780ec83ae0b9eaa.webm?t=1745517148\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1238940/extras/244fb12c34a204a08780ec83ae0b9eaa.mp4?t=1745517148\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
