    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Almost Home</strong> is a tense online co-op survival experience where teamwork is the only way off a hostile island.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Explore eerie, shifting environments together, where darkness, sound, weather, and panic can turn small mistakes into lasting consequences. Survival is about communication, awareness, and managing fear before it manages you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The island offers no safe path. Shelter, information, and moments of relief are scattered and often only usable under the right conditions. Knowing <i>when</i> to act matters as much as knowing <i>where</i> to go.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Built for online co-op, the game rewards coordination and punishes isolation. Stick together, share what you notice, and support each other as pressure mounts and options disappear.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Every session unfolds differently. Layouts change, conditions shift, and the island reacts to your choices. Sometimes pushing forward is the only chance you have. Sometimes hesitation is what keeps you alive.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>WORK TOGETHER</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Players must rely on each other to explore safely, manage limited resources, and keep panic from spiraling out of control. Staying close and communicating can mean the difference between escape and disaster.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4314290/extras/aadd54478bdbd82a33c82bec1de8e86a.poster.avif?t=1770871018\" width=960 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4314290/extras/aadd54478bdbd82a33c82bec1de8e86a.webm?t=1770871018\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4314290/extras/aadd54478bdbd82a33c82bec1de8e86a.mp4?t=1770871018\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>EXPLORE CAREFULLY</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >These places don’t want you here.<br>Move slowly through unsettling environments where light, sound, and visibility matter.
