In its vicinity you have to build everything your village needs. In order to put these construction projects into practice, raw materials are needed. The lumberjack provides you with wood at regular intervals, the farm produces food and houses will get you thalers. Be warned, however, each of these buildings also consumes certain materials. In order to be well prepared in the fight against the water, it is advisable to protect the village with various defense mechanisms. For example, dikes and low-lift pumps which can keep the approaching water at bay or transport it away from your village.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101620/extras/e7b8e84d169dc8d2ccf5cd9a0904629c.poster.avif?t=1640116713\" width=616 height=80 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101620/extras/e7b8e84d169dc8d2ccf5cd9a0904629c.webm?t=1640116713\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101620/extras/e7b8e84d169dc8d2ccf5cd9a0904629c.mp4?t=1640116713\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Storm surges and heavy rain are omnipresent! The construction of dikes can help keep the water outside of your village, but against the rain they are powerless. To protect the village from heavy rain you have the possibility to use Siels, pumps and ditches to drain excess water. With this procedure you are able to dry out flooded buildings and production can proceed.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101620/extras/b57783c5f89783c78a2b550afc97deb9.poster.avif?t=1640116713\" width=616 height=80 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101620/extras/b57783c5f89783c78a2b550afc97deb9.webm?t=1640116713\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101620/extras/b57783c5f89783c78a2b550afc97deb9.mp4?t=1640116713\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>As a Dike Warden in East Frisia in the 16th century, it is up to you to prove your skills in many different scenarios!
