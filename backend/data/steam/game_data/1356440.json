    "description": "Escape your captors…and endure your rescuers, but don't be late to the ball! When you are kidnapped, you must take charge of your rescue, and reclaim your rightful throne.<br><br>&quot;Kidnapped! A Royal Birthday&quot; is a 158,000-word interactive comedy by Charles Battersby, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br><br>Conspirators have imprisoned you in a tower, and are plotting to usurp your throne. And it's your birthday! Take command of the inept but well-intended crew sent to rescue you from your tower–a brazen knight, a snarky amazon, a cursed enchantress, and a humble peasant. Work together to escape your captors, outwitting your foes to make it back to the castle and regain your power as royal Heir. <br><br>But first: fight the three-headed chimera, the two-eyed biclops, and a horde of insatiable gnomes! (They're surprisingly dangerous after a few drinks.) Wield swords, magic, or fight with your wits and grace. If all else fails, pummel your enemies with a chamberpot tied to a stick.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Play as male, female, or nonbinary, gay, straight, bisexual, or asexual<br></li><li> Act like a damsel in distress (or an imperiled person) and let your rescuers do the work, or grab a sword and fight your own battles.<br></li><li> Unravel the conspiracy behind your abduction and thwart your scheming siblings.<br></li><li> Side with the aristocrats, or join a peasant rebellion.<br></li><li> Gain stature to prove that you are the one true Heir.<br></li><li> Harness fairy magic to bewilder and defeat your foes!<br></li><li> Disguise yourself as an Elder Vampire, stare down a giant, and take a nap in a glass coffin!<br></li><li> Find love with any of your rescuers...or marry a goblin. (You know you're curious.)<br></li><li> Bring peace to the kingdom, or revel in the chaos of civil war.</li></ul>",
