    "description": "The Dam Nation is a roguelike FPS where you will need to consider which enemies you can fight and which can be evaded. You can use tools to break your enemies’ lines of communication, lure them into traps, or when the situation calls for it - shoot them in the face with a rocket.<br><br>The game is set within a city constructed upon a colossal dam. You arrive in the city to find it overrun with horrifying headless monsters! As you fight to save the dam, you’ll also learn its secrets and discover the origin of the monstrosities attacking it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong> Procedurally Generated Levels: </strong> The game’s levels are different every time you play.   <br><br></li><li><strong> All kinds of items to play with: </strong> Make use of the many weapons and tools you’ll find strewn across the city. Invisibility cloaks, teleporters, communication jammers, lures, shields, machine-guns, rocket launchers; there’s sure to be something to your liking! <br><br></li><li><strong>A Monster Menagerie: </strong> Lots of different monsters. All trying to kill you in a variety of different ways.  <br><br></li><li><strong> 2 Player Co-op:</strong>  If you like you can team up with a friend, either split-screen on online!<br><br></li><li><strong>No Persistent Leveling:</strong> Many roguelikes have the player progress via leveling up or acquiring upgrades on each run through the game; there’s nothing wrong with that but it isn’t how The Dam Nation does it.<br><br>Though you might unlock new color schemes or game-modes as you play, a player starting their first run will have access to all the same equipment and weapons as a player on their 1000th run.<br><br>You progress through gaining a better understanding of how to deal with enemies and most effectively use your equipment, as well as learning more about the city you’re trying to save. <br><br></li><li><strong>No Crafting:</strong> Many games in this genre feature crafting, The Dam Nation Doesn’t.</li></ul><br>The game is very much still a work-in-progress, so things mentioned on this page might change.",
