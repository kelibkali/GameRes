With over 200 new spells and magical items, Tome of Magicstretches the horizons of every wizard and priest in the AD&amp;D 2nd Edition game.<br>In these pages are new forms of wizard magic including elementalists, metamagic, and wild magic, plus expansions of existing schools. For priests, whole new spheres have been discovered - chaos, law, numbers, thought, time, war, and wards - and powerful new quest spells lie waiting to be tapped.<br>All characters will experience the thrill of discovering new magical items such as the claw of magic stealing, dimensional mine, crystal parrot, ring of randomness, and staff of the elements. Tome of Magicis an invaluable expansion for all the spellcasting classes!<br><strong>     <i>     We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today.

This content is presented as it was originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed.
