They're placed on a special stand or table.</strong><br><br>Add the VIS P-35(p) pistol to your equipment!<br>This is the German version of the legendary Polish wz. 35 VIS. After taking over the F.B. Radom factory, the Wehrmacht resumed production in 1940 under the name P-35(p) removing the Polish emblem and the year of production. In total the occupants produced 312,000 pieces in several versions, which were gradually simplified. A small number of the pistols were manufactured in Poland, under conspiratorial conditions, from parts taken from the factory, with the barrels being made in the workshops of the Home Army in Warsaw.",
