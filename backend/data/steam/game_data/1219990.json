    "description": "Welcome to the Vecter - Donation Pack DLC<br><br><br><br>Before anything else, please read the following: <strong>Vecter is a 100% FREE GAME. It will always be free and does not require you to buy this DLC or anything else in order to play. If you download the base game, you get all of the content it has to offer. End of...</strong><br><br><br><br>Right, for those of you still here, Welcome! This pack is here to serve Vecter in two ways:<br><br>1. Provide a way for people to show their generosity and support for the development of this passion project. While I am doing this as a fun hobby and am happy to fund the development cost of Vecter myself, the part of my income I can allocate to this hobby is limited. All donations go back into the development or marketing of Vecter so that more people can enjoy a fun free game.<br><br>2. Participate in Steam sales. It is no secret that Steam sales are the main way games get exposure on the platform, that's just how it works, and I want to be a part of the fun to. During all sales this Donation Pack will be available at a discount for all those that want to purchase it.<br><br>Okay but where's the &quot;DL&quot; and the &quot;C&quot; in this DLC? It's not cool to not get SOMETHING for your hard earned money right? Here's what I can offer in exchange for your generousity:<br>- Some exclusive Wallpapers for your Computer and Phone<br>- A video of the developer (me) dunking a biscuit into a cup of tea using a hydraulic arm<br>- A little icon will appear next to your name in the leader-board to say that you've supported the game<br>- A text will appear on the game main menu to show that you have the donation pack installed<br><br>That's it for now. I might add more stuff as I think of and create it. For example one of the things I want to make is a 3D printed model of the ship. If I ever do it I'll stick the computer model in this pack so you can create your own.",
