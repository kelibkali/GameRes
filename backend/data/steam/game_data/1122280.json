As you explore the Kingdom, you'll encounter a world of strange happenings, from predatory plants to warring factions of peace-loving peoples and even goblins in the mines. Join the little witch as she sets out to uncover the truth behind these events and unravel the mystery of her stolen mail.<br><br>In this dynamic, action-packed game, you'll use your combo attacks, dodge, dash, and magical powers to take down enemies, incinerating them with fire, piercing them with lightning, or freezing them with ice. Your wand is more than just a magical accessory – it's a powerful melee weapon that can save you in critical moments.<br><br>Explore magical forests, dark caves, icy mountains, and abandoned castles to uncover hidden secrets and treasures. But beware of the dangers lurking around every corner, from old tomes filled with new spells to goblin ambushes.<br><br>Master new elements to unlock new paths and opportunities in this metroidvania game. Deep water will no longer be a threat when you've learned the power of ice magic, and lightning can even split rocks in your path. And with adorable pixel art graphics, you'll never have seen pixels so cute! With everything you expect from a fairytale game, Witchcrafty brings a touch of weirdness, featuring a little witch with an unhealthy love for explosions, a suspicious magic cat, and giant mushrooms ready to kick your butt.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1122280/extras/b61974aeb24f242a220e21a95c65879f.poster.avif?t=1722467330\" width=620 height=344 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1122280/extras/b61974aeb24f242a220e21a95c65879f.webm?t=1722467330\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1122280/extras/b61974aeb24f242a220e21a95c65879f.mp4?t=1722467330\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Featuring:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Dynamic action gameplay: use combo attacks, dodge, dash, and magic to defeat enemies<br></li><li>Metroidvania-style exploration: discover new spells, paths, and secrets as you progress<br></li><li>Immersive magical world: a journey through enchanted forests, dark caves, and abandoned castles<br></li><li>Unique characters: play as a little witch with a fiery personality, accompanied by a suspicious magic cat<br></li><li>Adorable pixel art graphics: enjoy the cute and quirky visual style of the game</li></ul><br>",
