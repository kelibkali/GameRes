    "description": "<strong>A Pathfinder/3.5 Compatible Adventure for 4 Level 1 PCs</strong><br>Shrouded in whispered rumors, Crow's Rest Island has been avoided as long as any can remember. Nothing but death, and the memories of those long gone, greet any who take to land upon the isle's shores. It is to this island that the PCs will find themselves driven as a storm threatens to drive their ship below the waves. Awaiting the PCs are far more than ghost stories upon this island, for there lives a very real threat, hiding here among the legends that keep sailors at bay.<br>A classic ghost story that casts the PCs not as adversaries to the specters, but rather as their benefactors, A0: Crow's Rest Island challenges the PCs with a tribe of foul kobolds, a haunted village, and the forgotten servant of a long departed ice devil. An excellent introduction to the  campaign setting, this adventure gives the PCs their first glimpse into Vikmordere culture. A0 may also be easily ported to any setting containing a northern wilderness near a large body of water.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>A0: Crow's Rest Island</strong> - Introduction to the A-Series Adventure Path!<br></li><li>Detailed maps by <strong>3x ENnie Award</strong> winning Cartographer Todd Gamble.<br></li><li>Designed to last between 2-3 hours and lead into A1: Crypt of the Sun Lord.<br></li><li><strong>Pre-generated characters</strong> complete with illustrations for fast play!<br></li><li>Included maps, tokens, and more!</li></ul><strong>Requires: </strong>The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included 3.5 or Pathfinder ruleset.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong></strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included Pathfinder RPG and D&amp;D 3.5/ OGL ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
