Double jumps? Yes. Rotating in midair? Sure why not. Driving on a wall and even ceiling? Of course, how could it be otherwise. Challenge your friends to ridiculous, but intense combat. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1679800/extras/6fa697b7277c7cecf056cea111f6d6a5.poster.avif?t=1742206947\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1679800/extras/6fa697b7277c7cecf056cea111f6d6a5.webm?t=1742206947\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1679800/extras/6fa697b7277c7cecf056cea111f6d6a5.mp4?t=1742206947\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><strong><i>Games are supposed to be fun not realistic </i>- Albert Einstein </strong><br>(he could have said that, who knows)<br><br>Never seen a tank that can jump? Now you have occasion to drive one. Additionally, you can double jump, because why limit yourself. Not to mention driving on walls and ceiling. Use these abilities to outplay the enemies, but be aware they can do the same!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1679800/extras/544643d0eb0339f56660498a7185d04c.poster.avif?t=1742206947\" width=600 height=194 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1679800/extras/544643d0eb0339f56660498a7185d04c.webm?t=1742206947\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1679800/extras/544643d0eb0339f56660498a7185d04c.mp4?t=1742206947\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>The funny thing is when you give tanks ability to jump, be extremely fast and add some ramps to maps they are now fighting in air. So yeah, there is an aerial combat in this game. To completely destroy realism, you can rotate your tank in air.
