Hope you will enjoy the game for what it is and not look too much into the grammar issues. Note that it is not available on steam anymore.<br><br><strong>English is not my first language</strong> and back then i decided to make the game in English even if i was not good so that more people would understand it and play it around the world... Please don't be mean, it is a free game... As of version 3.0.0.0 the game text as been changed a little to help the player understand the story and the lore a little more...<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1269600/extras/9fddc4246be97136491aaac1810ff272.avif?t=1686831702\" width=616 height=128 /></span><br><br>It is 2017, you are Atoa, a young student living in the country of Sarook.
