    "description": "Hot Dodge is the <i><strong>ULTIMATE</strong></i> fast dodging game! Even the best struggle to survive through all 14 action-packed levels!<br><br>In Hot Dodge, you are a delicious and beautifully unhealthy hot dog. Your main aim is to avoid the healthy vegetables at all costs! Watch out, as the evil Broccoli and dastardly Onions appear from all directions, determined to make you eat healthily! From above, from below, from the left, from the right, they'll fly at you with all their nutritious might!<br><br>Use the arrow keys to move. Don't ever touch the Broccoli. <strong>Freeze</strong> to escape the Onions. If you survive till the later levels, an energy gauge will appear on the left. This shows your invincibility - but only for a <strong>limited time</strong>. Hold the space bar to raise your shield. But don't waste it!<br><br>All rules can be found in-game.",
