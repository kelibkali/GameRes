    "description": "Become Carl, a disgustingly cute cockroach, as he attempts to escape an old lady's retro refrigerator by jumping, punching, and fighting his way through moldy enemies, manipulative mushrooms, and swarms of frozen vegetables. Along his journey through various shelves of food products, Carl finds himself befriending other fridge-imprisoned creatures who both help and hinder him on his quest. Roach Raid is a silly, fun, and enjoyable product that will either give you an appreciation for the majestic cockroach, or it will make you never want to eat food from your fridge ever again because ew, ick, and yucky and such.",
