A technology that will allow instant travel to distances never achieved before. But as it goes, things don't always go as planned. And a terrifying shadow is looming over the space of the three races.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >RACES</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1350310/extras/ee819ab5069782eb6dda7a229d842cf6.webp?t=1721298815\" width=616 height=50 /></span><br>When Arhn homeworld collapsed, they were forced to flee on their ark-like structures, drifting out into open space, to an unknown destiny. It was a miracle that they were fortunate to come across the Humans on their path. An even bigger miracle was that they were able to establish contact and learn to comunicate with each other. <br><br>With the help of Humans, Arhns - originaly an electric life form, had learend to live a new life incased within mech like bodies constructed by Humans. In return Arhns helped humans develop their first FTL drive. This boosted the Human space exploration and led to discovery of the N'hassa race. <br><br>The lizard people are cunning and ruthless natural born traders. They will sell anything and to anyone, as long as it brings profit. Some even suspect that the loss of earth in the catastrophic accident was secretly the doing of N'hassa.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >SHIPS</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1350310/extras/bfebbe230c70e7cef9a53e30016afde5.avif?t=1721298815\" width=616 height=320 /></span><br>Each race has their own unique ship designs, some are more suitable for passenger or crew travel, and some less. The N'hassa ships are often suited for trading, as is to be expected from them. Human ships vary from civilian transports to heavily armed battle ships. <br><br>Arhns even have some ships that are controlled by an integrated Arhn mind and lack any other crew whatsoever. And of course there are pirates, different groups, each with their own quirks and specialties.",
