    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>The Journey Starts</strong></h2>ClashingBlades is A Free-to-play Classic 3D MMORPG. it features Fantasy-themed gameplay reminiscent of your favorite games from the early to mid-2000s. Make a character and begin your quest in an open world with no guidance.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>It Gets Better</strong></h2>Invite your friends, create Guilds and Parties, Wage wars against other Guilds, or Participate in tournaments and weekly Siege wars for the ownership of one of Ethernia's cities. <br><br>If your Guild controls a city, your Guild master can impose a tax on every token that falls within the city's boundaries or every good that is bought or sold there; the money collected from these taxes goes into your Guild's treasury. The tokens can be taken out by the Guild Master or distributed among the Guild members.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Something about classes?</h2></strong><br>ClashingBlades uses a unique class system where you are what you wear. You don't choose a class at character creation. You select a weapon, and as you level up, you will be able to learn masteries and skills unique to your weapon, or you can switch it for another and learn a completely different mastery from what you selected on character creation. <br><br>You could only master two masteries per character, which allows you to use two different weapons. You could be a Warrior and an Archer or a Cleric and a Warrior. <br><br>That allows players to create a creative combination of skills and a brilliant PvP experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Game Features &amp; Missing Features</strong></h2><strong>EA currently offers the following features: </strong> <br>Authentication <br>Character Creation. <br>PvE, PvP, quests, inventory, and all the standard MMORPG features. <br>Social Features: Parties &amp; Guilds, World Chat <br>A large starter map (1024x1024) <br>For the time being, a single instance server can handle up to 2000 concurrent players. <br>optimized client for low-end computers.<br><br><strong>Features missing: </strong> <br>Siege battles <br>City ownership (one guild owning a city). <br>Battle arena for competitive PvP. <br>Shops (buying and selling items). <br>Player Trading <br>Player Shops <br>Marketplace <br>Quest Chains <br>Item Enchantment. <br>Quest Items<br><br>The missing features list will be updated.",
