However, Open Hexagon expands on the formula by introducing a <i>180° swap mechanic</i>, <i>curving walls</i>, <i>accelerating walls</i>, <i>scriptable levels</i>, and much more. Whether you're a veteran of arcade games or new to the genre, you'll find something fresh to spike up your adrenaline.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1358090/extras/929c17803f41e61a6f766c05c194722e.webp?t=1743781102\" width=616 height=57 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1358090/extras/cc0c2acceaad4649c967052477a9c2f8.avif?t=1743781102\" width=616 height=212 /></span><br>Open Hexagon was developed with the goal of being <i>open</i>. Players can create their own levels by using the simple yet powerful Lua scripting language. The amount of freedom that level designers have is unprecedented: keep your levels simple, or go wild and implement brand new mechanics and even entire new games! If you have never coded before, Open Hexagon can be a great (and fun) introduction to programming.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1358090/extras/0b21b9099a0e0b67fac7b29b4552dc69.webp?t=1743781102\" width=616 height=57 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1358090/extras/pic0.PNG?t=1743781102\" /></span><br>Open Hexagon features <i>secure</i> online leaderboards, backed up by a replay system and a cheat-prevention server.
