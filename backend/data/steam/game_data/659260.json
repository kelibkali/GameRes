    "description": "Canvas Quest is a turn-based JRPG made in RPGMaker MV. The game features an artstyle based around poorly made digital and physical art, featuring stickman characters and an abundance of obvious perfect circles and lines. Journey with Bob and friends to rid the world of the Evil King. However, things aren't always as simple as they seem.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/659260/extras/3ffc80cdbf6cb361ad35cbe0cfff70a1.avif?t=1609041145\" width=500 height=200 /></span><br>Bob is an Average Joe who lives in Circle Town with his wife, Suzy. His only real taste of action is the training he has just signed up for. When Bob comes home from Day 1 of training to find a note saying Suzy has been kidnapped by the &quot;Evil King,&quot; Bob rushes off to save his lover, meeting friends and foes along the way.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/659260/extras/904c44b406ff5a407f643c69a78b99ba.avif?t=1609041145\" width=500 height=200 /></span><br>Canvas Quest is a game where experimentation is heavily encouraged. New spells and moves that characters learn may be useless. They may only be useful in certain situations or when paired up with other moves or spells. They may even be super powerful and useful. It's up to the player to determine what works best, as nothing is certain to tell you the best strategy.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/659260/extras/25236875f7baf6de70b6cf72fa846d90.avif?t=1609041145\" width=500 height=200 /></span><br>Sure, you have slimes and bats, but those aren't your only foes! How about a slime in a mech suit? What about a tornado with a face or a small moon? Canvas Quest has those bases covered.<br><br>This game is over three years old now, and I've appreciated every individual fan! You all mean the world to me, and who knows? You might want to keep an eye out for something special very soon!",
