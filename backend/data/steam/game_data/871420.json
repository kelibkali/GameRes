A private detective, a witch, a thief, a professor, and even a ghoul—each with different stats, weapons, and combat moves, creating five entirely different gameplay experiences. The Detective offers a balanced playstyle, with average Health and Stamina. The Professor is a specialist in ranged combat, with less Health and a special shield granted by his weapon, the Tillinghast. The Witch does a lot of damage, has teleport abilities and elemental shields of fire and ice, but also a very low Health. The Thief is a specialist in melée combat that takes advantage of its stealth to maximize her damage. The ghoul does a lot of melée damage, has a high Health and regenerates itself, but can’t use medkits at all. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>DISCOVER THE SECRETS OF THE GREAT OLD ONES</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/871420/extras/ee9aa7f96ff4938e771f3deee8198563.poster.avif?t=1760103639\" width=616 height=300 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/871420/extras/ee9aa7f96ff4938e771f3deee8198563.webm?t=1760103639\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/871420/extras/ee9aa7f96ff4938e771f3deee8198563.mp4?t=1760103639\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The truth of the dark horrors that inhabit the universe is unbearable for any human mind.
