    "description": "Bounce off logs, fences, roller coasters, and whatever else you can find to pop as many bubbles as you can. Or turn on Dodge Mode to make popping a bubble result in a loss.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay on six unique levels, each with twists to keep the gameplay fresh. Or if that's not enough, unlock modes that change up the gameplay even more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease note that this game is designed for multiple people. Playing the game in single player would be a great way to get used to the game, but playing without another person will make the game get very dull rather quickly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo play Bubble Bounce today! Or maybe watch some gameplay or the trailer and decide based on that instead of a vague description.",
