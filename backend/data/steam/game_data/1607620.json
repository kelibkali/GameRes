    "description": "One night, at Just Another Museum, Tim The Time Machine decides he has had enough. After years of being put on display without his own exhibit, he figures it’s about time to get the recognition he deserves. He needs to destroy all the other exhibits to finally get his chance in the spotlight. But how exactly? Well, by kidnap- I mean recruiting a 67 million-year-old friend of course!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay as Tony, the Tyrannosaurus Rex! Tony is lovable, hungry, cute, and eager to watch everything crash and burn. Bust and break your way through three fun-filled exhibits to score points, impress Tim, and make it back home! Sweep the competition with your tail swipe, chew up your enemies, and destroy priceless artifacts to show them whose boss!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake a BITE out of the competition today!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game was made by a group of students in the EAE program at the University of Utah as our capstone project. We just wanted to sincerely thank you for checking us out and we hope you have a dino-mite time playing!",
