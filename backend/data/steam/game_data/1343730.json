    "description": "Ever want to watch your last brain cell bounce around like a loveable logo? Well this program lets you do exactly that, and you can blow them up! And you can upload any PNG you want to your files for it! they're in your documents folder upon downloading them! Have fun and let all of the world know of your explosive personality. Our program uses Unreal Engine 4 to make any PNG you upload to the right folder bounce around a screen sized 1920 * 1080 (resizeable within aspect ratio) window like it's the last brain cell you have bouncing around that head of yours. With customizable background space and pngs you can also use your mouse to brain blast every last bouncy thought in that window of yours.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo add your own assets simply navigate to &quot;Documents\\TLBCSprites&quot; then put any .png you wish to use into it's respective folder, I.E. braincells into Documents\\TLBCSprites\\Braincells<br />\r\nPlease not that at this time the import only works with .png however more support is planned for the future",
