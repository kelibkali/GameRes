He’s kinda gross and slightly transparent.<br><br>On the table, Saul’s got a briefcase, notepad, legal stuff, and there’s a plate of disgusting, mouldering, slimy biscuits. Like, the zombie equivalent of Rich Teas.<br><br>Finkle’s eyesight is a bit blurry and wobbly and blinky, slowly coming into focus&quot;</i>",
