    "description": "<strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story</h2></strong><br>•\tThe Land of Altrais was being united by a caring and benevolent king whose only hope was to see a Golden Age. In his travels the king met <br>        many races and worked tirelessly to help them understand the need for peace. Working with the Ancients he was able to foresee a great evil <br>        coming to tear the kingdom apart. While developing a mass tablet transportation system the evil was sowing the seeds of discontent and <br>        hatred.<br>•\tUnbeknownst to the king, the Evil in the East had its claws in all of the races one way or another and was just waiting for the right moment <br>        to strike. Whispers of this deceit reached the king who decided to try and defeat this evil alone before it would tear the kingdom of Altrais <br>        apart. Sadly he failed in his endeavor and the hope of a Golden Age for Altrais died with him…or so was thought.<br>•\tMany years later the kingdom of Altrais has been split into 7 distinct races who barely acknowledge that there ever was a chance for peace. <br>        The races all vie for the crown of Altrais, but none have been able to locate it.<br>•\tLegends speak that the king of old wore armor that was built by each race. This armor was imbued with such power that helped calm the <br>        minds of the people and see reason in working together. The armor is thought to be in the possession of the Evil in the East who now seeks <br>        the crown to fully seat themselves as ruler of Altrais.<br>•\tYou are but a squire for the King of the Humans and have been a servant all your life. Your family was killed in a tragic fire while working for <br>        the King and so he felt it his obligation to take you in and raise you. However, he could not let the other races think him weak so he could <br>        not take you as his son and heir. For what king deserves to rule when he cannot even have his own blood on the throne.<br>•\tEvil continues to roam the land of Altrais and threaten the very existence of the races. Rumors speak that the Evil in the East has redoubled <br>        its efforts to secure the crown. However, even quieter rumors have started to be heard the Evil in the East does not even control the Armor <br>        of Legend and seeks to destroy all races that may be hiding it.<br>                                                                                             <strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Combat</h2></strong><br>•\tTurn based battle system with up to 4 total members on the combat screen.<br>•\tVarious elements and weapon types causing the player to choose how they want to do battle.<br>•\tSpecific weapons and armors to specific hero classes will allow the player to develop the fighting team how they choose.<br>•\tEnemy levels with scaling to allow a continual feeling of progress and difficulty regardless of where the player adventures.<br>•\tUp to 36 total followers allowing for multiple variations of playstyles and party dynamics.<br>•\tRandom encounters that are specific to terrain and vary on creature type and difficulty.<br>                                                                                             <strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Questing</h2></strong><br>•\t7 races providing a total of 150 quests and multiple additional side quests all being contained within an easy to use Journal System<br>•\tOpen world adventuring and questing allowing the player to decide how they want to play and which races they choose to help.<br>•\tA blueprint system to allow the player to upgrade their City of Altrais into something more suitable to their questing style.<br>•\tConsequences for choices reminding the character that they are to be a force of good for the Kingdom of Altrais, since evil is already around.",
