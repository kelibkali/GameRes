    "description": "<strong>Ilamentia is a first-person mysterious abstract puzzler, featuring 96 mind-bender levels (with the demo restricted to 8 levels).</strong><br><br>The goal is simple, activate all souls and escape, but every level revolves around wildly differing mechanics where you must first discern the level's purpose before resolving its wishes. You may be tasked with manipulating physical structures or the realm itself, perhaps deal with waves of phasms or briskly bound through the aether. The mystery is to deduce the limits of the level's mechanics which evolve as you progress. Some levels focus on brain-melting logic, others rely on sharp reactions, but many more will test the limits of every facet of your cognitive faculties.",
