After Infinity the game has just begun, as there are much, much more to discover.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 2 years of updates, then 4 years of pretending to update behind the scenes<br></li><li> Multiple challenges, ranging from minor alterations to major challenges that forever change the way you play the game<br></li><li> 100 Steam achievements, but even more in game!<br></li><li> Less than a hundred perks, 0 talent and some miscellaneous upgrades too complex to go into detail about<br></li><li> An obscene amount of automation, including a custom scripting language. AD also happens to be about unlocking new stuff and automating all stuff.<br></li><li> Helpful tutorials in the helpful help page.<br></li><li> Two black holes to explore, 0 mini games, 4 “pets”. If your glyphs start speaking to you, please see a doctor<br></li><li> We added a shop!</li></ul><br>Antimatter Dimensions was originally created in 2016 by Hevipelle as a web based game, however it's development has since expanded to have multiple developers, and even more testers. During the first years, it was updated rather often, sometimes updates within 5 hours of each other. But after the Dilation update in 2018, Hevipelle and the team started working on the Reality update. Over 4 years later, the update is finally out, along with the Steam version of the game!",
