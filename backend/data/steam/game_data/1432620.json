An initial playthrough of Aimi could be completed in about 1 hour.  However, there are multiple different endings that can extend gameplay.</strong> Additionally, Aimi was developed as a sort of therapy game by a 16-year-old kid (me!) so do keep that in mind.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1432620/extras/526c95becd28608c17c0bd08be1829e1.webp?t=1674634867\" width=352 height=58 /></span><br>While Aimi contains only a few optional jumpscares, there is a lot of <strong>cartoon blood and gore and extensive swearing.</strong> The game <strong>explores themes of mental illness and suicide in a thoughtful manner.</strong><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Almost every random crash, increase in lag, or other error can be fixed entirely with a simple game restart. If you encounter an error that isn't fixed after a restart, please message me in one of the appropriate forums.</strong>",
