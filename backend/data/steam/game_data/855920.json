The title has absolutely nothing to do with the game play, but is the sixth development of a game idea I wrote months ago. There have been five developments of this concept and 6 is where it all comes together.<br><br>2. A walking/running/climbing simulator. Out run the evil that hunts a dark and creepy dungeon. No doors, the only way out is up. Climb walls and ledges to reach new rooms in the game.<br><br>3. New update now includes an object placement system. Take full control of your escape by dynamically creating paths up the wall during gameplay.<br><br>4. Instant death. No extra lives, healing or procedural damage. There are no guarantees with this one.<br><br>5. A casual game. 6 is not a BIG GAME! <br><br>6. An Idle game. To be honest, 6 is not something you play when you are in the mood for some serious gaming. Better played with a controller (XBOX 360 CONTROLLER), throw your feet up and while away the time until you're tired of being idle and ready for some serious gaming.<br><br>7. A 3d platformer. Take full control of the camera view for a better experience by simply moving the mouse or joystick. You decide what mode you play during gameplay, either top down or side scrolling, the camera constraints have been removed.<br><br>8. An adventure game. A <strong>SMALL</strong> adventure game.<br><br>9. Indie? YEP!<br><br>10. Dark and Moody? Yes. And “chill” paced.<br><br>11. Horror? it depends on the player to be honest.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/855920/extras/c2645c0088a9fbe2ccbe06c38c0d7c99.avif?t=1622571027\" width=630 height=420 /></span><br><br>Why should you buy/play 6?<br><br>1. A great price tag.  If you're the type of gamer who would play anything at least once, then you should buy this and play at least once!<br>2. You're a collector. Looking for a little something different for your library and collection? <br>4. You love small, indie or idle games<br>5. You're just in the mood for something totally different.<br><br>I hope this has been a very honest product description. Feel free to contact me for whatever. <br>Thanks.<br>Robert.",
