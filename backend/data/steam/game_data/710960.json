    "description": "&quot;Far down the road in Human history, an abnormality in space-time suddently appeared on one of Saturn's moon : Encelade.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpaceships of an unknown origin take the human fleet by surprise. A real genocide.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEarth also seems to be overwhelmed by the assault and only a small group, scouting near Encelade manageto avoid the attack. By approching the icy surface of the moon there is still one last hope of a counter attack againt the ennemy from another world.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnceladus is a shoot'em up inspired by the Playstation &amp; Saturn era infused with mecanical gameplay and modern artistic style.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEasy to handle, skill will be needed in order to beat the 7 levels available.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe player takes control of « Frost », a spaceship capable of firing energy blast or to channel a very powerful laser. He also has the ability to trigger a powerful explosion, ideal to get yourself out of trouble.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe number one asset of « Frost » is his ability to teleport. By a simple push of a button, it is possible to create a ghost of Frost while still defending yourself. By letting go of that same button « Frost » teleports to the ghost's location.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat technology allows you to move faster, to dodge overwhelming shots but also to gain acces to unaccessable zones.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTeleportation needs practice, but once mastered « Frost » becomes so much harder to destroy.",
