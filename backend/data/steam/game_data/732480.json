    "description": "<strong>Play drums, Harp, and many more in this fun musical App for all ages!</strong><br><strong>Jam Session VR</strong> is the exact opposite of most music/rhythm games.  There are no notes you are expected to play, and no audience waiting to &quot;boo&quot; you for a bad performance.  Instead, find yourself surrounded by a plethora of different instruments, from drum set, to harp, to theremin, to timpani drums.<br>You'll also find an intuitive touch based sequencer to add full band orchestration with a few touches of a few buttons.   Relax in a beautiful meadow and play around on a lovely harp, or rain destruction from the skies as the drumming God of Thunder!",
