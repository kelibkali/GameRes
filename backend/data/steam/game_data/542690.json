    "description": "<strong>Mahsung Deluxe</strong> is a unique blend of mahjong, concentration and puzzle solving cleverly combined into a single great game with 50 mind-bending challenges. Your task is to remove all tiles from the board by pairing up similar tiles.  Tile matches are only possible if a line can interconnect both tiles using no more than 3 segments (2 corners). A straight line can remove neighboring tiles that match. Wall-tiles are obstacles and part of the environment. On trickier levels, some tile images are hidden behind a “?” symbol and needs to be flipped and memorized for a correct match.",
