    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Delve into the forgotten ruins...</h2><br>Nothing gets in the way of the landscape. The player is merely there to witness, and there are no gameplay mechanics to dictate how the world arranges itself. There is no win condition, and no goals other than the ones you make. Set off in any direction for as long or as little as you see fit, taking only your memories with you.<br><br>The Walking Simulator A Month Club was an experiment to create and release a vast, explorable landscape with accompanying soundtrack every month that ran from 2015-2020. Between the solo development and the improvisational approach to design, some pretty wild and evocative stuff came out of it. Go forth and wander!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Over 40 massive (infinite?) worlds to explore. <br></li><li>Over 5 hours of music<br></li><li>Includes 5 unlreased walking sims from ZONES: ACT 2<br></li><li>Includes older classics like TRIHAYWBFRRFYH, CONDOR, and Voice of Vamana from 2014<br></li><li>Handcrafted by a single person over multiple years instead of going to church or therapy<br></li><li>Less than 50 cents a game, each of which is meant to last <i>at least</i> ~15 minutes<br></li><li>Jump off the edge of the world if you can</li></ul>",
