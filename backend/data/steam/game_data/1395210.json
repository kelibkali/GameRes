    "description": "At its heart, SOLAS is a beam deflection game. Rotate and reposition mirrors to connect light sources and unlock adjacent puzzles. Every pulse is moving to the beat at all times, and each puzzle is connected to the next. Explore this strange interconnected space, learn its rules, and discover the surprises that dwell within.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1395210/extras/a68bd8b9011d4681441df37979bc9f91.poster.avif?t=1726492011\" width=600 height=250 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1395210/extras/a68bd8b9011d4681441df37979bc9f91.webm?t=1726492011\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1395210/extras/a68bd8b9011d4681441df37979bc9f91.mp4?t=1726492011\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Rather than ordinary light beams, however, these pulses can and will collide with each other.
