Some attacks may prove to be even more damaging. If you resist and evade long enough, your shield should recharge automatically.<br><br><strong>ATTACK</strong><br>Broaster has a base weapon with infinite ammo but you can upgrade it later to more powerful (but with limited ammo) weapons that you find throughout the levels. <br><br><strong>ABILITIES</strong><br>When things start to get tough, you can count on different abilities that you will unlock while playing. For example, “Overdrive” is an ability that helps you move faster than anything else surrounding you for a limited time. Play the game to search for more abilities!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1612470/extras/b265e580bbd68d64fea78e4cd2c703cf.poster.avif?t=1636904902\" width=680 height=382 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1612470/extras/b265e580bbd68d64fea78e4cd2c703cf.webm?t=1636904902\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1612470/extras/b265e580bbd68d64fea78e4cd2c703cf.mp4?t=1636904902\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
