While on your way you need to try and keep your social distance to the people in the town. <br />\r\nBefore you can arrive at the party you will need to pick up some snacks that you can bring. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe length of the game is about 5-15 minutes.<br />\r\nThe controls are very simple with the use of &quot;WASD&quot; / arrow keys and the spacebar for interactions.",
