No one knows when it will strike again, and its true name and intentions remain unconfirmed. Humans know it only as “Consuelo.”<br><br>Enter Yosuke Hakone, a combat pilot with Earth's military entrusted with an unlikely mission: to take to the stars in the legendary Battle-SHEEP <i>Sura</i> with his mysterious new copilot Hanaco... and defeat humanity’s greatest threat yet!<br><br>But with Hanaco’s regressions and Yosuke’s own intergenerational inner demons to overcome, will this mismatched pair get it together in time? And just who <i>is</i> Hanaco, really...?<br><br>The second in Dento Nanahoshi and Liar-soft's STX-SF series following <i>ALPHA-NIGHTHAWK</i>, this space opera sequel is for the starry-eyed dreamer in all of us–a nostalgic nod to the old adage that what’s essential is invisible to the eye.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >CHARACTERS</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2051110/extras/672cacbb8f7e9ebe13174c097424f523.avif?t=1724996199\" width=600 height=225 /></span><br><strong>Yosuke Hakone</strong><br><i>Voice: Noboru Yajima</i><br><br>The STX Space Force’s newest captain.
