    "description": "URG is a retro-style side-scrolling arcade shooter with beautiful 3D graphics and a ton of action with big explosions. URG can be played alone, or as a co-op with up to 4 players (there's always one main player and up to 3 sidekicks).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nURG is short for Utopos Rocketship Game. URG is a remake of the first game I ever made, 27 years ago on Atari ST. The game back then was called Utopos.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn URG, you fly a rocket ship in an asteroid field, completing missions to collect items and solve puzzles, while shooting at enemies and blowing up asteroids. The game is divided into multiple themed worlds, each with multiple levels. As the game progresses, new worlds are unlocked and each world adds new gameplay elements.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you play URG and connect more than one controller, other players can join any time by pressing the A-button in the controller. This will spawn a sidekick, which acts as an assistant to the main player. Sidekicks can't die. They have two functions: they can give fire support to the main player, and they can give hearts, which will restore health. All players share the screen, which scrolls with the main player. If a sidekick falls outside of the screen, they can respawn by pressing the A-button again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis demo is a fully functional game, but the selection of levels is limited.",
