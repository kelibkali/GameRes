DMs need not spend long hours creating diversions for their players. we've done it for you. If you have The Book of Lairs, you already know what you'll find herein. These mini-adventures are arranged by terrain type (city, desert, hills, mountains, forest, etc.), with monsters in alphabetical order for easy access. At the back of the book is a combined monsters statistics table, showing all the necessary figures at a glance. These are familiar monsters (like the gnome, brownie, and ettin) and not-so-familiar ones (like the bakemono and tengu), form both original AD&amp;D sources and the Oriental Adventures book. Some of these mini-adventures are mere diversions; others can turn into minor campaigns! In any case, DMs and players alike are sure to be pleased with The Book of Lairs II.<br>We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today. Some older content may reflect ethnic, racial, and gender prejudice that were commonplace in American society at that time. These depictions were wrong then and are wrong today. This content is presented as it was originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed. Dungeons &amp; Dragons teaches that diversity is a strength, and we strive to make our D&amp;D products as welcoming and inclusive as possible. This part of our work will never end.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Daniel Weaver</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the D&amp;D Classics - AD&amp;D 1E/2E ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
