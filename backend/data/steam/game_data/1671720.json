You'll be faced with <strong>many challenges</strong>, and you'll have to fight your way through the world by either <strong>fighting, or awkwardly trying to make friends with your opponents</strong> through pick-up-lines, mean jokes, memory games, and other strange and funny interactions. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong><u>16 Potential party members for you to interact with!</u></strong> - Each of these characters has a <strong>bold personality</strong>, and a <strong>large amount of depth</strong> for you to discover. You can <strong>choose to adventure with whoever you'd like!</strong> There truly is a favorite for everyone to bond with, I promise.</li><li><strong><u>Tons of enemies for you to FIGHT or BEFRIEND!</u></strong> - This world has no shortage of <strong>intense battles</strong> with opponents that range from weird, wacky, tough, cute, and outright goofy!</li><li><strong><u>Varying battle mechanics to always keep the action fresh!</u></strong> - Many characters will switch up the tactics of battle, you'll be faced with <strong>various minigames based on the scenario</strong> you find yourself in.</li><li><strong><u>Absolutely hilarious.</u></strong> - This game is <strong>fast paced, action packed, and full of zany and ironic humor</strong> that anyone can have a nice laugh at.</li><li><strong><u>Lots of rabbit holes, secrets, and suspicious endeavors!</u></strong> - You will <strong>NOT</strong> run out of things to do.

You choose your pathway from start to finish, creating an extremely specific pathway which will then be recorded into your playthrough's Rhapsody!</li><li><u><strong>Vigorous mental challenges, and intense puzzles!</strong></u> - You may face mind-bendingly difficult challenges such as &quot;Spell Richard&quot; and &quot;Feather Carry&quot; throughout your Rhapsody. Would you dare come face to face with the infamous 3x3 slide puzzle?</li><li><u>Last but not least... <strong>An Online Social System and Event System!</strong></u> - You'll be able to share Rhapsodies between your friends. Share, combine, read through, and maybe even delete your friend's Rhapsodies! Timed events will be coming out after the game's release, so that you'll have the chance to continue your Rhapsodies.

Athenian Rhapsody holds so much variability that no two adventures will ever be the same, making each Rhapsody truly unique! The information contained in a Rhapsody ranges from <strong>each character you've interacted with</strong> as well as <strong>how many times your protagonist has farted.</strong><br><br>Each time you complete a playthrough, you'll <strong>receive a Rhapsody</strong>. Each Rhapsody acts as a way to <strong>take something tangible</strong> from your experience with your playthrough, and hold onto it forever. There are even <strong>ways to create new Rhapsodies by combining them,</strong> to multiply their complexity and create something <strong>absolutely insane</strong>!<br><br>You'll be able to <strong>use these Rhapsodies in various ways</strong> such as <strong>socializing with friends, accessing special timed in-game event adventures,</strong> and maybe even something outside of the game one day. Who knows! <strong>The sky is the limit</strong>!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1671720/extras/41c6723e8774ab2ffe91893a581b1595.poster.avif?t=1764612345\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1671720/extras/41c6723e8774ab2ffe91893a581b1595.webm?t=1764612345\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1671720/extras/41c6723e8774ab2ffe91893a581b1595.mp4?t=1764612345\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1671720/extras/8ae7f9afafcb91088814ffcef4f5538f.avif?t=1764612345\" width=600 height=150 /></span><br><br>Well, it might <strong>not</strong> be the absolute coolest ever, but it's definitely a game!
