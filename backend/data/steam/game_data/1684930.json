You can run in guns blazing, running, jumping, sliding, and dodging to keep out of harms way. If you prefer a slower approach, you can lay traps, let your enemies come to you, and pick them off from the safety of cover. Maybe you prefer to weave in between your foes, leading their attacks towards each other, and turning them against one another. With a full arsenal of mid-century firearms and explosives, you'll be well equipped to slaughter everything in your path - provided you don't get slaughtered first.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1684930/extras/0aeb1c67dd6b7f6429d91b338851e5fc.poster.avif?t=1765478494\" width=616 height=96 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1684930/extras/0aeb1c67dd6b7f6429d91b338851e5fc.webm?t=1765478494\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1684930/extras/0aeb1c67dd6b7f6429d91b338851e5fc.mp4?t=1765478494\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Combat in CULTIC is fast and deadly.
