    "description": "Hello Space Survivors, this is a little shooter game. In the future it will get bigger, now the game persits only of one main menue, and a little Shooter Level where you can kill zombies, buy weapons, buy new areas open and buy perks. Each wave the zombies have more health and every wave more of them will be spawnend. Also you can die through them. <strong>Plese understand that this game is being developed by a few developers with no experience in games</strong>. Later on we will add more stuff, currently the game mode is<br>some sort of zombie shooter mode where you can buy weapons and so on. (No Survival). A Multiplayer is also planned.<br>Current State is:<br>We only habe 3 weapons, a handfull of buildings , a little zombie map, a not so stable multiplayer implementation (host to client), a main menue where you can walk around, one character with no animations but we have a big dream.",
