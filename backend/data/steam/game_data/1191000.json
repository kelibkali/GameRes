    "description": "Pick Your Poison is a &quot;roguelike&quot; with turn-based tactical combat, random level generation, but with a twist: when you reach the exit, you pick one &quot;poison&quot; - a disadvantage that will stay with you in this run. Some &quot;poisons&quot; have beneficial effects as well, and can compensate negative effects of other ones. Choose wisely.<br><br>How far can you go? Can you endure all &quot;poisons&quot; and discover what comes after them?<br><br>Some examples of the &quot;poisons&quot;:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Only one hit:</strong> you're easy to kill<br></li><li><strong>Only one enemy:</strong> it's a good thing, right?<br></li><li><strong>Only one way:</strong> it's not like you were going to return anyway<br></li><li><strong>Only one key:</strong> don't need more than one for that door, right?<br></li><li><strong>Only one room:</strong> no more wandering around<br></li><li><strong>Only one potion:</strong> it's better be a good one<br></li><li><strong>Only one head:</strong> see in the direction you move only<br></li><li><strong>Only one eye:</strong> narrower vision<br></li><li><strong>Only one form:</strong> all enemies are skeletons... or are they?</li></ul>",
