    "description": "Wayward Souls is a randomly generated action-RPG with a heavy focus on story. Play as seven different heroes, all with their own abilities and playstyles. Fight through steadily greater hordes of enemies, as you learn about each character and find out what happened in the cursed tower you find yourself in.<br><br>Greatly inspired by 90's era action-RPG's, but with a faster pace and a focus on randomized replay value.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Customize each character with their own upgrades and equipment sets that change their movesets and abilities.<br></li><li>Over 100 different monster types.

Her Power Attack is a kick that stuns, with effects depending on her boots. She frequently finds items that let her blind, stun, or poison enemies.

Flung enemies will then damage and stun enemies they crash into. The Giantstompers also interrupt larger enemies that are stun resistant.<br></li><li>Toadskin Cowters poison enemies that hit her, stunning them after a few seconds.<br></li><li>Her Low Blow Upgrade permanently makes it so defeating large enemies will make her next dagger attack stun whatever she hits, even if her slash hits multiple enemies.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/559260/extras/025f3f44b43e10f5c01b7a591d9d864a.poster.avif?t=1572314802\" width=614 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/559260/extras/025f3f44b43e10f5c01b7a591d9d864a.webm?t=1572314802\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/559260/extras/025f3f44b43e10f5c01b7a591d9d864a.mp4?t=1572314802\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Blythe combines durability with a big sword that cleaves a wide area.
