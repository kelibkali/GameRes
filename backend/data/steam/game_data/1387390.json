Chelsey begins to spread the virus among the population of Treasure Island, San Francisco, which are mutated into murderous creatures with one goal, spread the Pangu Virus to all life. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe only group capable of stopping the spread of the virus is the men and women of the CERC, an elite government force created to combat a global rise in viral and biological warfare.
