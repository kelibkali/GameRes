    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >      Beasts &amp; Barbarians: The Garden of Death   </h2>        Welcome to the Garden of Death, the adventure of the Beasts &amp; Barbarians Savage Words setting!<strong>      This scenario is for a party of four Veteran heroes, with some experience (50-55 Experience Points is the optimal level), but it can easily be modified, following the Golden Edition instructions, for parties of different size and experience.      There is a place, among the dreaded mountains of the fallen Realm of Keron, where those dead before their time wake up, alive, to enjoy a new life.<br>It is a place of forbidden marvels, exotic beauties and obscure terrors. A place which is difficult to enter, and almost impossible to leave.      The mysteries of old Keron await the heroes in the seventh installment of the Beasts &amp; Barbarians adventure series! Dare you enter the Garden of Death?      * Bonus Content. This scenario includes an extensive Book of Lore dedicated to the Fallen Realm of Keron, its many dangers and forbidden secrets.<br>To play this scenario you need a copy of the Savage Worlds core rules and GE. TB is not essential, but you’ll find it useful, because there are several mass battles in this story. If you don’t own it, simply use the Battle Value rule (see box) and ignore the Edges, Hindrances and other advanced stats of the various fighting forces.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >    </h2><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i>Scott Geeding</strong><br><i>    Adapted to Fantasy Grounds by:</i>     <br>Scott Geeding[/b]<br><strong>   Requires:</strong>    The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Savage Worlds ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
