    "description": "Game features: <br />\r\nBased on the original story in a Fantasy World <br />\r\nTwo girls to start a relationship (and one additional secret character) <br />\r\n10 alternate endings <br />\r\nEstimated Gameplay Length: 2-10 hours <br />\r\nAvailable for Windows, Mac, and Linux <br />\r\nHigh replay value<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe young officer is transferred to the capital where he is supposed to be under 24/7 control of the Emperor’s people as a sign of loyalty towards his mutinous father. It’s ironic that the young officer is convoyed by his Childhood friend, Lin. Now she’s serving as one of the Emperor’s guardian and each mission will be valuable for her career. However first, these two have to get over the Mountain Pass and here is a rumor stating the mystical things happen in that place. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCharacters : <br />\r\n<br />\r\n•\tLin <br />\r\nShe is a childhood friend of the protagonist who is convoying him to the capital city. She is afraid of ghosts. She loves money very much. Her family is one of the main authorities of the Empire. Her mother is originally from the Western realms. Lin inherited her color of the hair because of her mother’s origins. And Lin was bullied because of that color. She joined the guardians after Kang had joined the border troops. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n•\tMei <br />\r\nShe is a tavern-lady who runs a guesthouse in the wilderness of the mountains. Kang sees a blue flower on her head and nobody else sees that flower. Sometimes, when she gets angry her eyes began shining. She loves gamble-games, and, most of all, she is mad about the game that was explained to her by some guest who was passing by that place. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n•\tShan <br />\r\nShe is the leader of the werewolves and she is a cold white she-wolf. There are rumors about her people that spread among the humans. Most of the rumor is filled with fear but nobody knows anything for sure. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n•\tKang <br />\r\nHis mother passed away when he was quite little. So he has vague memories about her. Kang used to play with Lin during the days of their childhood. When he was saved from the witch by a swordsman, Kang decided to be a warrior. However Kang was escorted to the capital because the Emperor was in rage so that the ruler could threaten to Kang’s father. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe loves drinking. He often crosses the line drinking really too much. <br />\r\nThere is a pendant on his neck that was presented by his mother.",
