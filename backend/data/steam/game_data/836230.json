    "description": "Heavy Blade is a fast paced 3D hack and slash dungeon crawler with gorgeous visuals and a heavy rock soundtrack.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nReminiscent of games like Doom and Heretic, Heavy Blade combines old school gameplay with a new graphics engine.  Run and slash your way through 30 levels of dungeons filled with horrifying monsters and defeat the wizard!   Choose when to use ranged or close attacks depending on what vials are nearby to refill.  Dodge enemy attacks, or force them into a small hallway to take them on one at a time instead of getting surrounded.  Or simply grind and improve your character until you can overpower them.  The choice is yours.  Being aggressive is the name of the game here. You are always vulnerable but don't worry about getting hurt!
