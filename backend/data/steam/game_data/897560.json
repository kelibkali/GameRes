The levels are procedurally generated based on the music track you are currently listening to. The player can perform a variety of tricks and chain them together into a combo. Land the combo to score points and compete for the high score. Think Tony Hawk's Pro Skater meets Guitar Hero.<br><br>Waveform Wipeout combines the fast paced action of pulling off a sick combo of tricks with the novelty of rhythm games. The levels are generated based on the song you pick, so the possibilities are endless. <br><br>Dynamic track generation also lets you load any song from your hard drive and surf the waveforms! Interact with your music like never before.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/897560/extras/accf584cc35e8eac52e7b075724c9333.avif?t=1666302684\" width=630 height=120 /></span><br><br>The aesthetic of Waveworm Wipeout is inspired by 80s cyberpunk films like Blade Runner, done in a mix of traditional pixel art and modern rendering technology. We want to create visuals that are evocative of classic sci-fi pop culture while keeping with modern aesthetics. We want Waveform Wipeout to be more than just a game. It is a whole new way to experience the music you know and love, while also being exposed to new music. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Follow the beat of the music and the prompts on screen in arcade mode for that authentic rhythm game experience. <br></li><li>Surf the waves and do whatever tricks your heart desires in freestyle mode. <br></li><li>Unlock new characters and environments by playing through story mode. <br></li><li>Load any wav, mp3, or ogg file and surf the waveform of your music. <br></li><li>Search for songs on YouTube and play them directly in the game.<br></li><li>Twitch streamers can interact directly with their viewers. Chat members can use commands to queue songs in the streamer's playlist.<br></li><li>Create and save playlists of your favorite music. <br></li><li>Select what frequency range you want to surf on. Play the bass, mid range, or high end of a song!</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/897560/extras/0ee8329f47f236e417a26e032ad112f8.avif?t=1666302684\" width=630 height=120 /></span><br><br>We are hard at work talking to a number of indie artists to create a killer soundtrack to include with the game.
