Prosperous trade routes and well-manned keeps, on the other hand, allow cities to grow, train larger armies, and project influence outward - sometimes at the expense of their neighbors. Over time, these chains of cause and effect determine which noble houses thrive, which collapse, and how prepared the realm is for the war that is to come.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Varied Tactical Battles</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Fight through battles shaped by where you are and who you side with. Escort a caravan through bandit-infested territory while raiders attempt to seize its cargo. Infiltrate a farm under cover of night to burn its grain store. Or lead the assault on a besieged castle, storming the ramparts and throwing open the gates for the army behind you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1355900/extras/38190ca6a5de1856c5747ee824d08b57.poster.avif?t=1769536562\" width=780 height=300 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1355900/extras/38190ca6a5de1856c5747ee824d08b57.webm?t=1769536562\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Progression through Exploration</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You begin your journey knowing little beyond how to fight and trade.
