Beautifully photographed 2D graphics inspired by movies like The Lighthouse, Night of the hunter, and Persona. With gameplay-driven storytelling and slow-paced claustrophobic dread, Leväluhta is a unique horror experience like no other.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >MATURE HORROR</h2>Noir horror set in real-world Finnish locations, no jumpscares or splatter.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >UNIQUE GAMEPLAY</h2>Classic adventure game mechanics but fully modernised with a heavy emphasis on movement and strategy. Play as a eldercare nurse without the resources for her job - to take care of an old patient and her house. Vacuum, make food, clean, fix, and so forth, based on job descriptions. Race against the clock, manage your stress levels, and fight against randomised daily complications.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >PLAYER-DRIVEN INVESTIGATION</h2>Taking a twist to the horror mansion trope, your patient has a small house with unexplained hidden layers. Uncover its secrets at your own pace, with your own smarts.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >FOCUS ON REPLAYABILITY</h2>One-time branching dialogues &amp; small special randomised events that don't show up on each playthrough. Instead of vast content, Leväluhta focuses on small, meaningful, curated details.</li></ul>",
