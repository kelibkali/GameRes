Explore the dangerous realm of Leviathan with your friends, ride dragons and soar the sky, dive into the unfathomable waters, or even shapeshift into a strange tree. Do everything you must, for only those who survive to the end can be finally redeemed.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1061670/extras/06dbb7d42f57ab7f72dcc6f2009d9fd7.avif?t=1582870852\" width=600 height=150 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Infinite Possibilities</h2>Fight against multiple opponents in unpredictable battles, with surviving as the only purpose. The battle space has been expanded to an unprecedented extent. Use ambush, class perks, special abilities or even the environment to create an advantage. The game map is full of elements that may affect your situation assessment or interfere with your established strategy, such as special terrains and the ability to climb trees and dive into waters.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1061670/extras/0caf2b510deb3e08d0ace58031bcb7d2.avif?t=1582870852\" width=600 height=150 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Distinctive Characters</h2>Heroes with different class perks and abilities each have their own strategies. In addition, by killing other players or unique monsters you can acquire their tactical abilities. While in the preparatory phase, you can arbitrarily create builds. Whether to extremize a certain attribute or go for a balanced distribution, the choice is yours.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1061670/extras/a88ecbba3b459e53e14ad4e7a1a4f296.avif?t=1582870852\" width=600 height=150 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Tactical Views</h2>All combat abilities are designed around a top-down perspective to create a multi-layered and ever-changing battlefield. Camera view is an important tactical dimension that can be utilized through a large number of subjective behaviors such as class perks, special abilities and environmental interactions. Feeling restricted by the rules? Break them.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1061670/extras/a6530baff8804a629eb4f3e5f19de5b3.avif?t=1582870852\" width=600 height=150 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Believable Physics</h2>What happens to a player or monster's model at the moment of being finished is handed over to the ragdoll physics. It may fall off the cliff, hit a stone pile and bounce back, or may be directly slapped against the wall of a building in life-like animations with accurate physics simulation, all of which produce a solid and fluid combat experience.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1061670/extras/1df91c6f22b3eba57f5b6b3185f3b8a2.avif?t=1582870852\" width=600 height=150 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Changing Environments</h2>The day and night cycle and changes of weather will affect the combat environment. For example, rains will make the ground slippery and disrupt the movement of heroes, a sandstorm will blur the vision, and a thunderstorm will drive the monsters more violent and irritable. Factors can affect the judgment of the battle environment. Many environmental factors can affect your judgment of the combat environment.",
