    "description": "Songs of Syx is an epic city-state simulator, in a low fantasy setting. Start off as a small village and build your way towards megacities with 30k inhabitants, while still simulating every detail. Enjoy equally big and gory battles.<br><br>Songs of Syx is currently on kickstarter, and if you like it, consider pledging there to get a steam key at a discount.<br><br>The current version offers a city-builder. Here is the full vision:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Vision</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Scale</strong> Population caps and army sizes are 5-digits, while still sticking to the near 1:1 scale of traditional village-simulators. <br></li><li><strong>Nobility</strong> In the colony phase you will be busy managing individual subjects, but as you grow you can elevate your favorite plebs to positions of prominence and have them help you govern and boost different parts of your city and empire. Beware though, as even your most trusted and beloved friends might secretly forge plans to usurp you.<br></li><li><strong>Influence</strong> Being a ruler doesn't necessarily mean absolute power. You must grow and maintain your influence over time by accommodating your plebs and your nobility and be forced to make choices that lie in their interest rather than your own. If you overstep you can expect riots, betrayals, invasions, and emigration.<br></li><li><strong>Dynamic Culture</strong> Races and factions will start with a certain mindset, religion, and culture, but there is nothing stopping and influential king from molding a unique identity for their people. You will be able to dictate to your own laws and policies, to sophisticate or plunge your civilization in savagery. <br></li><li><strong>Trade</strong> Anyone can set up a self-sustaining shithole anywhere. But if you want a city and later, an empire, you need to get into the game of trading where goods are priced by supply and demand and wars and fierce diplomacy is waged for the control of goods and trade-routes. <br></li><li><strong>Maintenance</strong> Every construction you build and every technology you research will require maintenance in the form of labor and resources. Failing to deliver that might cause ripples that can quickly collapse a once-mighty civilization.  <br></li><li><strong>Modding</strong> The game itself is built like a mod of simple text-files, sprite sheets, and a few scripts. It will be easy and encouraged to make your own races, stories, and worlds.<br></li><li><strong>Hordes, Immigration, Slaves</strong>  The global climate might plunge into a mini ice-age, or suffer from a severe drought which can set in motion vast migrations and hoards, looking for their next meal, or fertile lands to settle on. Might be yours. Break the backs of slaves as they toil day and night plowing your fields and cleaning your latrines. They might not be happy about it though. Open your gates to all the kinds of strange races of Syx and see your economy and culture blossom from the diversity or hate and racism tear your city apart.</li></ul>",
