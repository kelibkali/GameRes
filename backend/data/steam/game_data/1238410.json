    "description": "Raise your litter of six baby werewolves while hunting for your true love! Dating a werewolf means you’ve been left with a litter of kids. Six kids. Kids who turn into cubs when they get upset. You’ve gotten the silver out of the house, and stocked meat in the fridge – but unlike their father, you can’t turn into a wolf to lay down the law!<br><br>There’s hair all over the couch, endless howling (literally) in the night, and no dates. But maybe, despite the mayhem, you’ll manage to invite the cute neighbor next door out for coffee…<br>Never Date Werewolves is a 104,000-word interactive supernatural romance novel by Rebecca Zahabi. It's entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br><br>You’re busy rushing around Lyon, the French city of lights, zooming between your job at a store downtown and the summer school where your children attend.

But if they believe all werewolves are monsters, then it might be difficult to introduce them to the pups. Or there’s the teacher who manages the summer school, always smiling, full of energy and ideas for the kids to try out. Although there might be more to them than meets the eye…After all, everyone has their secrets, and they’ve managed never to be overwhelmed by your brood of werewolves.<br><br>One thing is certain: the full moon is coming up, and even if you’re not a wolf, you’ll have the kids ready, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, for the most important hunt of their young lives.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Play as genderlocked female; date men, women, non-binary individuals, or no one at all!<br></li><li>Land a date – and maybe more – with the cute broody neighbor or the sunny schoolteacher.<br></li><li>Help your kids choose an alpha for their pack and complete a stunning art project for school.<br></li><li>Assist while the kids hunt down game under the full moon.<br></li><li>Change the worldviews of people around you, and impact how werewolves are perceived.<br></li><li>Keep your pups under control, deal with their babysitter, and impress your boss at work – at the same time!</li></ul>",
