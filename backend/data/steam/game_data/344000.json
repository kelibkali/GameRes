Highest level, bestest gear, ruggedly handsome, and unrepentant jerk. For refusing to aid one stinking demon-infested town, you are immediately – and deservedly – cursed. Your powers, your wealth, and your weapons… Poof! Gone. To overcome the curse, you’ll need to make use of whatever weapons you can find.<br>Swords, chainsaws, machine guns, pogo sticks… Use them while you can.<br>Because they’ll all fall apart in your hands.",
