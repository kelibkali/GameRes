It was something special and precious, something so valuable that entire kingdoms fell over for its beauty… GOLD! <br><br>Thousands of adventurers wander into Alaskan forests, mountains and grasslands to get only one thing - even one gold ounce. You are one of them and your goal is simple - become the wealthiest man in the world!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Explore &amp; Survive in the unforgiving environment</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1440400/extras/77d185df92b79f92024a488cff623d0c.avif?t=1626688102\" width=628 height=224 /></span><br><br>Alaska, as breathtaking as it is, is not the most welcoming place in the world. As a gold miner you have to be well prepared. Take your warm clothes, food and proper equipment in order to survive at least one day. Blinding blizzards and heavy rains will put you through the various challenges.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Fight your way and defend what’s yours</h2><br>There are many dangers in the wilderness - wolf packs, bears and, of course, people who won’t be as humble as you and will kill anyone for gaining some golden nuggets. Equip yourself with some knives or a gun, survive the night and be victorious!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Dig, mine and sell!</h2><br>Search for caves and caverns, dig through the hard rocks and get your gold. Don’t forget to equip yourself with good quality picks, dynamite and building supplies, or your mines won’t be easy - no one wants to die because of collapsing ceilings.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Take care of your dogs</h2><br>You will have a dog sled at your disposal while traversing the open world of Alaska. Those good boys need food, warmth and love from their owner. Don’t forget about customizing their equipment!",
