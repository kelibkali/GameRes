    "description": "I'm Calling The Cops! is a first-person cartoony action strategy game in which you manage a small store. Customers buy items but they also steal them! You can use the money you earn to buy combat and automation upgrades. Keep your shelves stocked and upgrade your character skill-set. You can knock-out customers whose fingers are particularly sticky. If you afraid the customer that you've challenged is going to get the better of you, you can call the cops. See how much profit you can make in an in-game week (17 minutes IRL time).",
