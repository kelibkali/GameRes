    "description": "An old-school difficult single screen 8-bit 2D platformer where the main objective is to cast a block in front of your player to use in creative ways to get through levels - make bridges, stairs, use it to fall safely from heights and block enemy projectiles. Hikaru's Cube offers classic arcade gameplay that mixes elements from Super Meat Boy and Bubble Bobble. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou play as a Sorceress named Hikaru (that isn't very good at being one). Instead of being able to cast fireballs and lightning like others, the best you can do is cast a block that can be used in a variety of ways, but disappears after five seconds. To make things harder, Hikaru cannot kill any enemies in the game! Hikaru is searching for a missing Knight in a dungeon known as 'The Prism'.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game as it is currently is available to play the first 35 levels! The first few are an introduction to the mechanics whereas the last few levels will test even the most die-hard of platformer fans. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay is like this:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRun around, use the block to pass obstacles and enemies, collect a key in each room and exit through to progress. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures in game:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- 8-bit graphics and gameplay for that nostalgic hit!<br />\r\n- Music from D9 Robot <br />\r\n- Single player mode<br />\r\n- Cut-scenes with an unfolding story<br />\r\n- 35 levels <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlanned updates:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Upgrades on block powers!<br />\r\n- More levels<br />\r\n- Storyline extended",
