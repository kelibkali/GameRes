    "description": "Aenaon-To Ancient Greece and Back<br>Remember when you wished for a journey to the times of Zeus and Athena? When you dreamt about your winning entrance to the stadium of Olympia, as the winner of the everlasting Olympic Games- everybody cheers for you and you only! Well, the time is now; and forever.<br><br>Aenaon-To Ancient Greece and Back takes you to an exciting journey to Ancient Greece. As the main character, determined to explore<br>yourself and your capabilities, you will set on an adventure from the colonies in Massalia (France), to Poseidonia in South Italy.<br>Before you dock to Greece and head towards Olympia, you will share your days with Socrates, Pythagoras, the Olympian Gods: this is not<br>a journey as usual. It is the path to knowledge and strength, to sports and friendship. A course that lasts forever- this is exactly what Aenaon means.<br><br>Aenaon-To Ancient Greece and Back is adventurous and educational a game that makes the most of the virtual reality features to recreate<br>the experience of those times- in terms of action and thinking.
