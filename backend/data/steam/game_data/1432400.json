Whether you enjoy burning foes with damage over time, launching shuriken shaped blasts, shooting 4 shots simultaneously in a cone, piercing through enemies or firing at hit-scan speeds, the <i>Shop</i> has your creativity covered. <br>With thousands of combinations, your choices matter in your spaceship's growth and will affect your experience moving forward at harder rounds. Purchase power in small increments each round, or save your points to large amounts to see the <i>Shop</i> offer some higher-level supreme upgrades. <br><br>You can choose to play a quick session on-the-go (casual, 5-10 minutes), experience the normal gameplay at its best (normal, 25-30 minutes), or take on a harder realm to truly exercise your precision (hard, ~1 hour).<br>Enjoy our assortment of soundtracks to soothe your session, or get invigorated with an upbeat tune.<br><br><i>Save</i> your best gameplay session on the global leaderboards and see how you fare against others around the world, in any category! <br><br>And all for the price of a cup of coffee.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1432400/extras/a7e77e36b8d2b7a1e414925cb1bd803c.poster.avif?t=1602280685\" width=640 height=170 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1432400/extras/a7e77e36b8d2b7a1e414925cb1bd803c.webm?t=1602280685\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1432400/extras/a7e77e36b8d2b7a1e414925cb1bd803c.mp4?t=1602280685\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>CONTROLS</strong>  — All with a mouse</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Move at insane speeds</strong> - your spaceship's position is where your mouse cursor is. <br></li><li><strong>Shoot simply and easily</strong> - launch shots upwards with a click or hold click to continuously shoot. </li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>FEATURES</strong>  — Ever-growing with updates</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Wide variety of starting spaceships each with their own benefits and traits<br></li><li> Randomized enemy spaceships with unique attack styles each round<br></li><li> Creative bosses with stimulating skills that'll challenge your dodging precision<br></li><li> An upgrade system that allows you to build upon your spaceship (power, size, speed, flame shots, homing shots, spread shots, and more!) <br></li><li> Global leaderboard with statistics and records of gameplay sessions from other players<br></li><li> Adaptive <i>Shop</i> system - dynamically displays upgrades relevant to your income and availability<br></li><li> Large range of background soundtracks to harmonize with your experience<br></li><li> Three difficulty modes (casual, normal, hard) to suit your skill level and time available</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1432400/extras/491ee8865f8372cb3e57143ea0b44224.webp?t=1602280685\" width=296 height=40 /></span><br><strong>Christian Then</strong> — Full-game German translations.",
