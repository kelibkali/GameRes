    "description": "You're a member of Inout Inc., an international team of professional exorcists. You deal with the most unpredictable cases of exorcism.<br><br>This time, you and your team find yourselves in an old mansion in Madyland. According to locals, horrible things have been going on there for years. They remember a young woman who lived there, raising a gravely ill son. Then, she disappeared, and no one has seen the boy since. Many people tried to uncover what happened, but no one has ever returned from the old mansion. Neighbors say, &quot;There's a lot of evil there!&quot; <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Exorcism Ritual:</strong> Expel the evil from the possessed by following a list of ritual tasks. Keep an eye on your indicators, explore the map, and beware of dangers in this eerie place. And remember, simple tasks may not be as easy as they first appear.<br><br></li><li><strong>Audio Clues:</strong> Listen carefully to stay alive. If your heart is racing, that means the possessed is nearby. Using 3D audio technology will help you figure out where the possessed is and avoid deadly encounters. For the best experience, use headphones.<br><br></li><li><strong>Co-op Mode:</strong> Play with friends up to 4 players or team up with other gamers on online servers within the game. Teamwork makes tackling tough challenges easier and more fun, and the built-in voice chat helps you coordinate better.<br><br></li><li><strong>Game Map:</strong> The map has been designed in a way to continuously enrich your gaming experience. Exploring the map will lead you to discover various strategies for completing missions.<br><br></li><li><strong>Rising Challenge:</strong> The further you advance in performing the ritual, the game conditions grow increasingly perilous.<br><br></li><li><strong>Nightmare Mode:</strong> A hardcore test for dedicated gamers. The game conditions are at their most treacherous.<br><br></li><li><strong>Single Player Mode:</strong> Brace yourself! Study the rules, pick up on the subtleties, and stay vigilant for dangers.<br><br></li><li><strong>Replayability:</strong> Each gaming session offers a unique experience. The locations of ritual objects, locked doors, traps, and the behavior of the possessed are randomized.</li></ul>",
