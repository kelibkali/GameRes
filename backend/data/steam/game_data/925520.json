When all of a sudden the usual glitch* occurred that pushed Bedford's rake out of his hands and into the sky. All I remember after that was Bedford's red face, his barrage of curses, and him walking into the woods.&quot;<br><i>*We, as the developers of the wonderful Bummertown, do not agree with said statement.
