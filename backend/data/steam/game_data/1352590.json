    "description": "You remember Earth as a peaceful place but something happened. You go down to investigate and things don't add up. People are starting to question the nature of reality. Is it all a collective dream?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is a traditional rpg maker game with turn based combat and heavily story driven gameplay. You play as Ego, the main character, in a mission down on Earth where you have to understand what's happening and resolve every problem that is leading the planet towards an early apocalypse.",
