The shards of color found it's way into some lucky hands and color factions were formed. And for some reason, it's your job to help fix it. You play as a cat dude and fight your way through extremely difficult bullet hell style boss battles in an attempt to get back home and out of this strange world. In the process, you'll make many friends and enemies.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1529040/extras/3733953255304ab07bded2d24624cf81.avif?t=1763953683\" width=612 height=150 /></span><br>The game switches between a lively top-down overworld to a straight on bullet-hell boss rush type game. You'll fight many different bosses while attempting to bring together the color shards. There is different modes for varying levels of difficulty, so if you just want some casual play there are options, as well as a very difficult mode for those seeking a challenge.",
