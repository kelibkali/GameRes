His memories are hazy at best, but he doesn’t have time to doubt or dawdle: if he doesn’t get out in 12 hours, he’s done for. A woman claiming to be his coworker, Izzy, tells Leroy that he is an EMT whose arrival in this world was a mistake; she begs him to follow her back to reality as soon as possible. But there are others in this purgatorial realm, each trapped in their own waking nightmares. He can’t just leave them behind, can he?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Travel through the minds and lives of eight fatally flawed characters, each seeking redemption. As the dreamlike realm tests them, Leroy must help his fellow inhabitants of this waiting room outside death’s door recover their memories and find a way to escape. Each must grapple with questions larger than themselves— Are we fated to follow our worst tendencies, even in the face of certain destruction? Is it futile to fight your destiny? Can we allow ourselves to accept help from others? And most importantly: Can we change?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1003900/extras/adc0fc6ae41b646227c5ff9e227f5aae.poster.avif?t=1752828201\" width=700 height=328 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1003900/extras/adc0fc6ae41b646227c5ff9e227f5aae.webm?t=1752828201\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1003900/extras/adc0fc6ae41b646227c5ff9e227f5aae.mp4?t=1752828201\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1003900/extras/802e47c22d5f813acb2d6bb7cbba3dae.webp?t=1752828201\" width=182 height=52 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Explore an ever-shifting nightmare world while creating a deck that gains power from deepening your relationships with others.
