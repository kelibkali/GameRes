    "description": "Unanimy starts as a simple puzzle game about getting a collection of robots to the same tile, while all of them move in sync. Throughout the game's six worlds, the mechanics become more and more complicated.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2077860/extras/29fa9637a5365c8cf590ebcf75597b09.poster.avif?t=1657755840\" width=600 height=454 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2077860/extras/29fa9637a5365c8cf590ebcf75597b09.webm?t=1657755840\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2077860/extras/29fa9637a5365c8cf590ebcf75597b09.mp4?t=1657755840\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>We start with the basic task of getting our two robots together. They move in sync, you can use the walls to stop them, and if any fall off, you fail the level and must either restart or undo your last move.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2077860/extras/0d499a2dfd5b364b0f230fcc127c38bd.poster.avif?t=1657755840\" width=278 height=244 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2077860/extras/0d499a2dfd5b364b0f230fcc127c38bd.webm?t=1657755840\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2077860/extras/0d499a2dfd5b364b0f230fcc127c38bd.mp4?t=1657755840\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Later, we see colored walls.

Unlike red and blue which can't fall off or you fail the level, green robots <i>must</i> fall off for the level to be complete.<br><br>All the while, you'll be not only solving each level, but optimizing your solutions through the <i>par</i> mechanic, which gives you an added goal on <i>every</i> level to complete it in as few moves as possible!",
