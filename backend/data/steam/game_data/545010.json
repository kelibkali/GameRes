    "description": "To commemorate Kou Shibusawa's 35th anniversary, the &quot;Kou Shibusawa Archives&quot; will be opened in the Steam Store. Here we will revive popular previously released titles. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this fourth round of releases, we offer &quot;Ishin no Arashi,&quot; released in 1988. Its story takes place at the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Players become one of the 12 key figures of the time, like Ryoma Sakamoto, Kaishu Katsu, and Takamori Saigo. They guide Japan to freedom by using persuasion and force to unify the 13 domains under one ideal, whether that is loyalty to the shogunate or the emperor, or even to the public opinion.",
