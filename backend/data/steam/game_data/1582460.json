    "description": "At the opening of the <i> Age of Cygnus</i>, a great era of commerce begins. Traders ply this vast frontier, transporting cargo between planetary systems, discovering markets, and establishing trade routes. <br>The player, newly graduated from Trade Academy, has the option to chart their career path among the stars. As a space mariner, smuggler, or pirate (or a cunning mix), the player collects crew members and star maps needed to succeed in the unforgiving void of space. Friends and foes are everywhere, and whom the player can trust often is based on loyalty to profit over loyalty to the player.<br><br>About the Demo:<br>Smugglers of Cygnus is coming as an early access alpha demo for free to give everyone an opportunity to watch the game grow and mature. <br>Players will be able to explore the game as we expand, develop, add content, replace placeholders with final assets, and build it out without having to ever worry if they spent money on an unfinished game.",
