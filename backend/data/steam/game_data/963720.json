You're going to need it!! <br><br>Oh, and watch out for Midnight Madness Mode.....<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/963720/extras/cdd77c0a9075063251095d34cfcb3fe6.poster.avif?t=1712406926\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/963720/extras/cdd77c0a9075063251095d34cfcb3fe6.webm?t=1712406926\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/963720/extras/cdd77c0a9075063251095d34cfcb3fe6.mp4?t=1712406926\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Key Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Full freedom of movement<br></li><li>Open World Environment<br></li><li>Realistic VR environment<br></li><li>Creepy as hell itself<br></li><li>Vast array of brutal weaponry<br></li><li>Limb dismemberment and decapitation<br></li><li>Fast paced intense action<br></li><li>Jesus radar</li></ul> <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/963720/extras/9a36ecf7130c34bba717c201615e7a81.poster.avif?t=1712406926\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/963720/extras/9a36ecf7130c34bba717c201615e7a81.webm?t=1712406926\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/963720/extras/9a36ecf7130c34bba717c201615e7a81.mp4?t=1712406926\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Weapons</strong><br>While you start off the game with a minimal set of weapons, you will soon discover new weapons along the way that can be swapped out to upgrade your arsenal. But choose wisely and tactically which weapons you decide to pick up.<br><br><strong>Control Scheme</strong><br>Promising full freedom of movement (no teleporting!) Beasts Shall Rise is a single-player first-person VR shooter which allows you to explore the environment however you choose. The game uses motion controllers and IS DESIGNED TO BE PLAYED WHILE SEATED.<br><br><strong>Replayability</strong><br>The game is designed to offer an arcade style experience with a high level of replayability. Spawn points and pathways will change on each play meaning no two games will be identical. BSR has a full weather system and day night cycle which will change randomly with each game start. The game will adjust it's difficulty on the fly to meet your skill level. There are many hidden Easter eggs to be found, some of which are triggered to appear on certain days of the year. Don't play late at night though....or risk finding yourself in Midnight Madness Mode!<br><br><strong>Hardware Requirements</strong><br>BSR is VR only. Currently the game is confirmed as working with Oculus Rift CV1, Meta Quest 2 (via Link/AirLink), Valve Index. Oculus headsets seem to work best running with the Oculus app set to OpenXR by default. <br>Base spec graphics card is GTX1080 - the game is developed on this card. RTX cards don't seem to handle the game as well as GTX through SteamVR, but there are graphics settings in the game that allow you to find the setup that works best for you. There is support for Nvidia DLSS and NIS. I recommend setting resolution to 100% or lower in SteamVR and disabling SuperSampling. I strongly recommend launching in DirectX 11.<br><br><strong>Health Warning</strong><br>Please DO NOT play Beasts Shall Rise if you suffer from any health issues or are pregnant. This can become a very intense experience and may contain jump scares. Not for the faint hearted! Contains strobing and flickering lights, swearing, smoking, decapitation you name it. By purchasing/playing the game you agree not to hold the developer or publisher responsible for any accidents/injuries/health issues.",
