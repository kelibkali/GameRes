You play as a pilot, stranded in a mysterious area of space where asteroids try and hit you at every attempt they can, and flying away loops you back to where you once were. The aim of the game is to survive a full 8 minutes while the ship self-repairs all functions before it can escape the asteroid field.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Will you be able to survive the harsh environment of space and escape before your ship is blown to smithereens?</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Take on sentient gods</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Throughout your experience on Rocky Mayhem, you will encounter the 3 Deities of Mayhem. You must take them all on to earn freedom of the asteroid field and the intergalactic police once and for all. Face Volcanic and Frozen in Classic mode, and prepare yourself for the final showdown with the Reality Deity.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Play various other modes!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Along with the main game comes Arcade.
