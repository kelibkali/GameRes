    "description": "In the year 2299 of the Galactic Standard Calendar, a host of invaders from outside the Federated Worlds descends on the colony planet Hera. You are Séraphine Letourneau, a test pilot for a major research and development company forced to join the fight after they invade during a routine test of an experimental flight suit. Challenge the enemy on the ground or in the air, gradually earning weapons, upgrades and defensive tools in the effort to save the planet in a top-down shooter/adventure hybrid inspired by games like The Guardian Legend, Zelda: A Link to the Past and Fester's Quest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSéraphine can strafe, dodge, equip three special weapons simultaneously, and survive otherwise fatal hits as long as she has at least 1 point of shield strength on her microjet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEquipment Types: <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWeapons- Special weapons with limited ammo. <br />\r\nCrisis Triggers- Special tools that trigger effects once you're one hit from defeat (where your shield gauge is zero) <br />\r\nDodge Tools- Special tools that add a property to your dodge.",
