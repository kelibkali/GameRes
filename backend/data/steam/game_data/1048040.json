    "description": "Exosphere is a short but challenging indie game. My take on the punishing climbing game genre. You aim, shoot &amp; bounce your way into the outer layer of the atmosphere using just your mouse. Can you make it to the top?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1048040/extras/10aa58750d83b77d7fe401c76047af09.poster.avif?t=1564930507\" width=540 height=304 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1048040/extras/10aa58750d83b77d7fe401c76047af09.webm?t=1564930507\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1048040/extras/10aa58750d83b77d7fe401c76047af09.mp4?t=1564930507\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>The game uses two different views. The eagle-view &amp; the side view. <br>The eagle view is used for observing &amp; navigating through the environment.<br>The side views are primarily used for shooting the ball. Use the mouse to aim &amp; shoot towards your destination.<br>Visit the yellow tiles to save your progress (until you exit the game).<br>If this is your first time playing, watching the tutorial video on the main menu is highly recommended.<br><br>Music by Avaren.",
