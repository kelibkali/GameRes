His weapons target specters, shadow monsters that invisibly attack people... and the Zodiac. As one of the few who can, it's up to Kotachi to both protect these constellations and use their powers in battle to keep everyone safe.<br><br><i>Asterism</i> at its heart is an action visual novel inspired by astronomy elements, namely the constellations that make up our sky- especially the Zodiac. Choices accompany many of the dialogue menus in both play styles, and can determine how side characters end up by the end of the story- including an optional male love interest.<br><br><strong>Demo Features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Around 1-3 hours long<br></li><li> Branching dialogue trees<br></li><li> Multiple art galleries</li></ul>",
