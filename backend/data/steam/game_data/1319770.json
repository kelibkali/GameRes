Routed and leaderless, the Godfathers have lost their grip on Las Vegas. A new breed of Dons has risen from the ashes of a lost war against the Justice Department to rule over Las Vegas. These self-proclaimed bosses work to reclaim what's been lost to the other crime syndicates and corporations that now own the city.</i><br><i> Rebuilding their empire begins with the cunning and deceitful associates they've recruited among the conniving denizens of Sin City and beyond.
