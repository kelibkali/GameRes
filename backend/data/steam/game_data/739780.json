It will be removed from sale shortly and no longer supported by the developer or publisher</strong><br><br><strong><i>What if every apocalypse scenario happened at the same time?</i></strong><br> <br>Welcome to <strong>LVL99: AxeRage</strong>, a gratuitously violent 2D Action-Platformer inspired by the iconic pop culture of the 80's and 90's. Based in a fictional Chile, this righteously brutal ode-to-Arcades is heavily saturated with references to many of the nostalgic low-budget B movies, old school anime, and classic SNES-era platformers that we know and love.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/739780/extras/0a7f39f104c9be6909944d925ea7b0f6.gif?t=1668180491\"><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/739780/extras/0a7f39f104c9be6909944d925ea7b0f6.poster.avif?t=1668180491\" class=\"bb_img\" /></picture></span><br> <br>Enter the fray as Cheins Tsurya, an axe-wielding renegade firefighter who must face an unholy apocalyptic menagerie warring over Earth’s vital energy. With brute force, a little supernatural intervention by some indigenous Chilean deities, and a RADioactive dog, players must free Earth from unrelenting hordes of aliens, robots, and zombies, <i>oh my</i>. AxeRage will also offer 2P Mode for the players who appreciate the camaraderie of couch co-op, introducing the gun-toting Tyrius Domain inspired by Terminator’s Kyle Reese.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/739780/extras/1287498e4af757956ac3a43c44e2460a.poster.avif?t=1668180491\" width=300 height=300 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/739780/extras/1287498e4af757956ac3a43c44e2460a.webm?t=1668180491\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/739780/extras/d4bf6d44dbb58c4582f9990177c969b9.poster.avif?t=1668180491\" width=300 height=300 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/739780/extras/d4bf6d44dbb58c4582f9990177c969b9.webm?t=1668180491\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>Gameplay is a close combat gorefest full of combos, plenty of hack and slash, and more platforming than you can shake an axe at.
