    "description": "<strong>Medusa’s Labyrinth is a very short mythological first-person horror game set in ancient Greece.</strong> It takes myths and legends that have stayed with us for over 2000 years and mix them together in a game that blends horror with stealth.<br><br><strong>The player will have to carefully pick their path through the abandoned hallways on Temple Island</strong>, through winding catacombs and dark corners to solve the mysteries that lurk within the labyrinth.<br><br><strong>The game in it's current state was originally planned to be a part of a much larger game</strong>, but we decided to launch this version as a short free adventure, so anyone with a Steam account can play it without paying a dime. We really hope you will enjoy the experience, as we made it public for just that reason: For you people to get a glimpse of what Medusa could have become with a longer production time and additional funding. Right now we are working on something similar, a spiritual sequel to Medusa and we hope to show/tell you more about it soon!",
