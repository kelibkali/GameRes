Asteroid Caligula passes the Earth’s orbit, coming so close to the planet that fragments breaking off it (meteorites) impact the Earth. A farmstead is struck and destroyed by a meteorite in the Rhine province of the German Empire. The conflagration threatens to spread to nearby towns. In this unique historical mission, the player takes charge of historical units (a pumper and firefighters) to get the situation back under control.<br><br>About 100 years later, Caligula is approaching the Earth again. Only this time, it is on a direct collision course with our blue planet. Once again, its coming is heralded by meteorite impacts.
