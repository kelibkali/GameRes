Create your own skater and get them to the end in one piece!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- No Game Over: dying will put you one level back. Collect coins to stop going backward!  <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Minimalistic and catchy visual style and 8-bit beats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Increasingly challenging gameplay: the more you progress, the more you'll wanna give another try!",
