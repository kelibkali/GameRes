    "description": "When the universe began, a new race came into existence, the Infinitian, a race of unbelievable intelligence and technology who exist simultaneously without any sort of variance in every parallel universe.<br />\r\nFor millennia, they explored every corner of the universe: in the end, after some time, they created five intelligent races who they implanted on many planet across the galaxy and then they left, continuing their roam into endless expanse.<br />\r\nOver millennia, these new races evolved and began their expansion in the universe, colonizing new worlds and founding empires more and more big.<br />\r\nEvery race worshipped the Infinitian as Gods, always seeking their consideration, but even in the sporadic circumstances of their passage through a star system with their enormous spaceship, the Infinitian simply ignored the race, persisting in their own way.<br />\r\nFor thousands of years, everything in the galaxy relatively worked out, until the day the Infinitian simply disappeared from the universe, without leaving almost any sign, like they never came to existence.<br />\r\nEvery race blamed the others for the disappearance of the Gods and within few years, all of them went to war, a galactic war for the dominion on everything and everybody.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt’s right here where the player will begin the adventure!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExpand your empire by colonizing every planet in your first star system.<br />\r\nBuild resource production and research buildings and don't forget to create defense fleets: remember that you aren't alone in the galactic neighborhood!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFight against four other races for galactic dominance: build defense towers, massive battle cruisers and fight in epic space battles!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUse time travel technology to your advantage but remember that others will too: a potentially endless time war awaits you!",
