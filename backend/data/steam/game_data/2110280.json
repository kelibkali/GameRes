In this Demo, you'll play the first half of Chapter 1 of our Story Mode. You'll meet Fleet and learn about our unique turn-based combat that the game is built around. We hope you enjoy this taste and come back for the full course on February 28th when Dungeons of Aether releases on Steam!<br><br>Dungeons of Aether is a turn-based dungeon crawler designed by Nick ‘ampersandbear’ Blackwood from the Aether Studios team. Rivals of Aether is known for its intense competition and twitch skills, while Dungeons of Aether allows you to take things at your own pace - but it’s still just as challenging!  Every choice you make can lead you deeper into the dungeons or to an early demise. Will you carry out a treasure chest, or be carried out in a pine box?<br><br>The combat in Dungeons of Aether uses a dice draft system that ensures each battle is unique while challenging the player to adapt the pool of dice each turn. Use fortune to your favor to defeat your foes, collect treasures and shift the odds in your favor. .<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2110280/extras/49db375af5f5d1edd5c9b2de20c38157.avif?t=1695661662\" width=620 height=120 /></span><br><br>Dungeons of Aether introduces four exciting new heroes to the world of Aether, each with their own unique skills and memorable personalities.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2110280/extras/0fde3402ed8d716adc7a1569169d5812.avif?t=1695661662\" width=620 height=172 /></span><br>Fleet is the self-proclaimed protector of her hometown of Julesvale, although she’s seen as a clumsy menace more than a hero.
