Then <strong>the priceless gift of the Makers turned into a curse</strong>, as the strongest men, who grew power-hungry, became tyrants. <br><br><strong>The Panopticon had been established</strong>: an order of powerful wizards that started regulating magic, allowing only a little glimpse of it to be used by their underlings. The punishment for those who defied the law was <strong>Oblivion</strong>: an eternal sleep prison of the mind that forced the body of the traitors into life while their mind was imprisoned in a never ending limbo.<br><br>This was the second age:<strong> an age of dictatorship, fear and hatred</strong>; mankind was strong and safe, but was no longer free. <br><br>Oppression lasted for centuries and it seemed it would never end, but all of a sudden something mysterious and terrible happened. The great Cataclysm, the causes of which are still unknown, left behind a scorched world, freeing forces of entropy on the lands of men that brought mankind on the verge of extinction.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/457130/extras/9373ee9800477394d1c966ac2a9ecd14.avif?t=1580425818\" width=620 height=147 /></span><br><br>Runes uses a new locomotion system which combines 1st person and 3rd person gameplay mechanics. <br>The name of this system is &quot;4th Wall&quot; since the player crosses the wall from spectator to actor in a seamless yet engaging manner.<br><br>The system works as follows: all interactions (such as fighting, dealing with puzzles, etc) happen in 1st person, however when traversing long distances the view can be switched to a 3rd person fixed camera. In this mode the player will see his avatar, and control it as in a regular 3rd person game, while still being able to move in room-scale and observe the environment. This allows for many interesting new concepts, from puzzle mechanics to narrative choices. <br><br>4th wall is however not the only locomotion solution adopted within the game. As of now we have several main locomotion systems working inside the game: 4th Wall, trackpad locomotion and teleport.",
