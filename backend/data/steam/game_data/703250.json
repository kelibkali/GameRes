    "description": "AstroShift is a unique free-roam 2D space shooter, where your ship's destruction doesn't mean death - the explosion ejects you into space, and you have to find another ship before your air runs out. There are 30 different ships - each with different specs and weapons - to take on the invading forces and run them out of your system.<br>                                                                    <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/703250/extras/f4951973e45f18a77b239e5ceb8ed705.avif?t=1508691827\" width=560 height=64 /></span><br>You are free to roam each level - rescuing Allies to fight along side you, dodging space debris and enemy fire, destroying enemy fortifications and opening the Warp Gate to the next sector.<br>                                                                    <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/703250/extras/10a00400c0402ea6321c7dcfeea1b03c.avif?t=1508691827\" width=560 height=180 /></span><br>The enemies in AstroShift are also free to do what they want; so sometimes they'll pull off amazing moves, flanking you and boxing you in - other times they may panic and retreat, ram their wingman while dodging asteroids, or kill each other with friendly fire.<br>                                                                    <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/703250/extras/8effe410fc3c551dcd82e7d7089e5ccf.avif?t=1508691827\" width=595 height=229 /></span><br>If you see an available ship you'd like to appropriate, simply hit the Self-Destruct button and fly your astronaut into it!
