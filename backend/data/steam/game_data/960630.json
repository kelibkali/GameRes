The goal is to stay on the central  black hole to collect mass from it while strategically denying opponents access to it. Players must keep opponents at a distance just long enough to reach critical mass and explode, scoring a point for their team. Players have to be careful while in combat, as firing kinetic projectiles sacrifices large quantities of mass in return for larger projectiles. Reaching critical mass is the only way to score, so players should keep an eye out for micro-black holes that will give them a quick boost. The player or team with the most points at the end of the match is declared the winner.<br><br><br>Developer Note: <i>&quot;This was my first release game and senior seminar project. I spent a little over 16 months working on this title in my free time after class and work. All future content will be added to the game as free DLC. Thank you for all of your support.
