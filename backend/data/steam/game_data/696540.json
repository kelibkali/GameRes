When time is your life, how long can you last? <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE:  Defeat enemies and gather crystals to gain more time, but beware--the more damage you take, the less time you'll have left. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- A SIMPLE GOAL WITH INFINITE APPROACHES: With procedurally generated maps offering countless challenges across multiple modes, the action only stops when you do.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- UPGRADE AND CUSTOMIZE YOUR LOADOUT: Mix skill and strategy to hone your personal gameplay style, and keep the odds ever in your favor by permanently upgrading your weapons and ship. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- THE NEED FOR SPEED: A custom game engine allows for unprecedented speed to get you in the game as soon as possible--you'll be playing before most other games have even booted. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- NO REST FOR THE WICKED: 60 Second Strike is the debut release from Amplecti Chao, a one-person indie outfit with over a decade of industry experience including the Destroy All Humans! and Borderlands series.",
