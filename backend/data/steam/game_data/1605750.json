This tome of treasures includes items any vampire or vampire-hunter would be delighted to discover, in addition to items themed for a wide variety of horror scenarios, from witches, werewolves, ghostly haunted houses, and mad scientists and their creepy constructs (like those featured in the<br><i> Construct Codex</i> from Legendary Games), to ancient liches and cosmic cults devoted to eldritch entities from beyond the stars! Whatever flavor of horror you want to include in your 5E game, the<br><strong> Treasury of the Macabre</strong> has got treasures worth winning, from the<br><i> beyonder's veil</i> and<br><i> clockthief's candelabrum</i> to the<br><i> witchblood stylus</i> and<br><i> sanguinary torque</i> .
