There are 2 modes available: you can play against Bigfoot controlled by AI, or another player can play as the monster. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Eyewitnesses often mention its enormous size, incredible strength, and elusiveness. For many years, researchers searched for him, but no one could provide evidence of his existence. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You are a Bigfoot hunter with an important mission: to put an end to rumours once and for all and prove to yourself that Bigfoot is not just a myth or an invention of the mind... His existence is real, real enough to make your blood run cold. Collect ammunition, study the terrain, and defend yourself from predators. You must use everything available to you to avoid becoming the bottom link of the food chain and to survive the wilderness of the American wildlife sanctuaries. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Playing as Hunter</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Gather a team of Bigfoot hunters among your friends or go alone.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Arm yourself with the most modern equipment, your only chance to fight off Bigfoot.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Use the tools at hand and your own cunning to increase your chances of survival.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Remember, there are other predators in dark forests.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Engage in a fight with an ancient primate, but remember that sometimes the hunter becomes the hunted.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/509980/extras/768006116e5226a01243b6e2e361d287.poster.avif?t=1766936179\" width=576 height=192 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/509980/extras/768006116e5226a01243b6e2e361d287.webm?t=1766936179\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/509980/extras/768006116e5226a01243b6e2e361d287.mp4?t=1766936179\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Playing as Bigfoot</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >People have begun to trespass too much; protect your territory from uninvited guests.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Get food to become stronger.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Use the skills of a predator and unique abilities to hunt people.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Darkness is your friend, fear binds the hearts of your enemies.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Arrange ambushes and set traps; your victims will not be safe from you.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Or just rip out the road sign and charge into battle!</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/509980/extras/0952ccf852b16aebc9461507bf8b3f8e.poster.avif?t=1766936179\" width=576 height=192 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/509980/extras/0952ccf852b16aebc9461507bf8b3f8e.webm?t=1766936179\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/509980/extras/0952ccf852b16aebc9461507bf8b3f8e.mp4?t=1766936179\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Features</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Several US national parks to explore.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Single Player mode.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Online co-op with up to 4 players in the mode against Bigfoot under the control of AI.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Online co-op with up to 5 players in the mode against Bigfoot under the player's control.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The game is being developed on Unreal Engine 4.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p>",
