    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Jans Tokenpack 011 - Countryside Villagers</h2>For every big city, there are many small villages that support them by growing crops and livestock. These countryside villages are often filled with interesting characters, and provide great roleplaying opportunities for your players.<br>A small village is often a great place to start your adventures because there are challenges that better suit the lower levels of your players.<br><i> Quests and plothooks can include:</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><i> &quot;Something has been attacking the farmers lifestock at night.&quot;</i><br></li><li><i> &quot;Every full moon, screams can be heard coming from the local graveyard.&quot;</i><br></li><li><i> &quot;The wolves in the nearby woods are becoming more and more agressive.&quot;</i></li></ul>Fill your villages with colorful and visually descriptive tokens.
