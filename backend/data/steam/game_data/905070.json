You might pee green for a while. You’ll start playing to see what can happen but you’ll keep coming back to hear me talk about it all.<br><br>The tale I have for you is of a heroic, although pungent lad who crash lands on a foreign planet while on a cargo mission through deep space. He needs your help to survive until his rescue ship arrives.<br><br>Finding food will be the simple part, because the stress of surviving alone manifests as hallucinations of deadly demons. You’ll need to help the lad deal with his past to overcome his demons and get home.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/905070/extras/1b45ce2aead9ea8b1182d96653a40816.poster.avif?t=1599617024\" width=400 height=400 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/905070/extras/1b45ce2aead9ea8b1182d96653a40816.webm?t=1599617024\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/905070/extras/1b45ce2aead9ea8b1182d96653a40816.mp4?t=1599617024\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Features!<br><br>Combat will butt-slap you hard and fast (I heard you like that) with a huge variety of nasty demons to duel.
