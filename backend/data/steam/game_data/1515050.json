    "description": "The Vestigial Princess is a DLC that offers a new piece to the overarching story that ties House of Velez and Grave Prosperity together. It is also a look at how a 3D Grave Prosperity Remake could potentially play on UE4. This DLC is primarily meant to test the waters for the latter.<br><br>Take on the role of the &quot;Vestigial Princess&quot; and endure the twisted machination of a familiar antagonist.<br>Solve deadly puzzles and fend off disturbing creatures with a combination of hack n slash combat, OTS gunplay, and supernatural powers, all while piecing together the clues of your identity that are scattered about the area.<br><br><u><strong>NOTE</strong></u><br>For users who wish to use a PS4 controller: you will need to have a 3rd party software in order for the game to recognize its inputs. I have included an option in-game to replace the on-screen tutorials with PS4 button mapping in case you don't want to play with keyboard/mouse or can't use an XBox controller.<br>The DS4Windows software works perfectly with UE4, is free, and requires no set up at all. Just open the program and then open the game and you're good to go!",
