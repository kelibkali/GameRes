Years pass and Tamatsu gets sick, despite this the man most feared by the crime lords still remains. Over time he has three sons: the eldest Shinya, the second child Kasuga and the youngest Aiko.However, in the Iwata family tradition only the men can learn the secret techniques.<br>This creates a gulf between Tamotsu and his daughter Kasuga, who disappears at a young age to follow the ninjitsu path, hoping one day to prove her worth.<br>The years pass, the situation does not improve in the USA, and North Town continues to be hit by chaos.<br>Tamotsu's situation is becoming increasingly precarious and as a result a gang of criminals decides to capture his youngest daughter, to put an end to his dojo and to stop him from helping the weak. So, Shinya becomes a formidable fighter despite his young age, and decides to go in search of his little sister. As he leaves the dojo to look for those responsible he is reunited after many years with his sister Kasuga, and is ready to put his pride aside in order to save Aiko.<br>Thus begins the legend of the Dragon of Karate and the Dragon of Ninjitsu!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/593740/extras/5c7f97af2301aab84d9763d2b2c62037.webp?t=1666984180\" width=239 height=62 /></span><br><br>The game combines and enhances the early era scrolling beat em up games (like Kung Fu Master and Vigilante) with action ninja style games (like Shinobi and Ninja Cop Saizou).<br>The player can control Shinya and Kasuga, who will take turns in seven different stages. Shinya uses punches, kicks and weapons to defeat his opponents; while Kasuga prefers jumps, speed and long-range attacks with her lethal Kunai.
