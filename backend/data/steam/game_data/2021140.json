    "description": "Winter is coming. As in - it's almost here. Wouldn't it be nice for the entire clan to gather up around the hearth fire in a newly-upgraded town hall, sip some mead, and listen to the Housecarl as they tell the stories of great battles of the past, and fantastic sagas of long-gone heroes, now only remembered by their burial mounds? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrozenheim is a serene Norse city builder with RTS combat that will take you into the times of Viking sagas. Immerse yourself in the original epic soundtrack by Tom Acrofear with vocals by Liz Katrin.",
