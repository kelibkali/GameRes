    "description": "&quot;Sometimes words alone can't paint the whole picture.&quot;<br />\r\nA VR game about depression.<br />\r\nChange the dim world, fill it with light.<br />\r\nEach inky struggle improves your sight.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn real life as in game the isolation is absolute, yet you are never alone in your suffering and struggle, so many suffered before you with you and long after you are gone. A game, a virtual symbolic space for introspection and calm confrontation with the topic depression. No instrumentalizing of depression for a story. Depression is the story. with its duality, undramatic yet all consuming, Isolating and yet indirectly unifying aspects. if you need a place to confront yourself with the topic depression, for your own sake or others you love, this is our effort to create it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDepression is isolating &quot;single player&quot; but the experience of the game &quot;topic depression&quot; is unifying. Depression realness served by depressees for depressees.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWindows Mixed Reality Headset Note:<br />\r\nThe game supports OpenVR which means WMR headsets, excluding Hololens, should be supported. We have not done any testing with WMR headsets so please try the demo prior to purchasing to see if it works.",
