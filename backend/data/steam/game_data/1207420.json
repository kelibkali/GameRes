    "description": "Chico is not a game in the way you may think, even if you will be able to loot and craft; it is something we can call a screensaver customizer ( what you craft in the game is what you get in the screen saver )... and if you don't like to customize at all, then let the AI do it for you.<br><br>Our hero ( who’s named Chico ) finds himself alone on the peak of a mountain in the middle of nowhere ( somewhere in the far west ); he can only get resources to create tools or buildings which might be useless during gameplay, but for sure will make his own life better, giving him a lot of different things to do in his free time ( when you are not forcing that poor guy to do something boring indeed ). For example if you get to build an hammock you might see Chico while taking some rest in your coffee time as soon as the screen saver starts ( or maybe not ).<br><br>The gameplay is very simple and intuitive because, as we’ve already said, the game purpose is to give you the ability to customize your own screensaver and thus see how Chico enjoys himself doing exciting sports like throwing stones against condors and more; for the same reason we have also introduced a new sandbox mode.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Windows screensaver integration</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>In-game screensaver mode</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>AI ( just let the screensaver run and look at what happens )</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Sandbox mode</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Looting and crafting systems ( survival mode )</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Day-night cycle</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Customizable time speed ( time is set to your timezone )</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Inventory manager</li></ul><br><strong>Resources</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Wood</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Stone</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Water</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Sandstone</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Rope</li></ul><br><strong>Useful tools and buildings</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Axe</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Pickaxe</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Shovel</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Knife</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Hammer</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Workbench</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Storage</li></ul><br><strong>Free time ( used by Chico only when screensaver is running )</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Campfire</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Hut</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>WC</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Cauldron</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Shave toilet...</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>…..and much more</li></ul><br>Our plan is to support the game with constant updates and thus releasing new tools and buildings to get Chico’s free time more comfortable.<br><br>That’s our idea, let us know what you think about it.<br><br>Greetings,<br>1Monkey2Brains.",
