There is a library called the Loreforge that connects to the Brewed Awakening cafe that holds at least twenty-five lorebooks for you to peruse. Their contents range from lengthy tales of heroic deeds to detailed descriptions of races or geographical locations. If you feel well-versed enough in the lore, feel free to take on a Pan-Pan in a quiz gameshow.<br><br>. There are real-life time-dictated events. The amount will expand in the future but for now, you can visit the Giving Grove once a real-life day to smash three barrels that deposit a randomized item for you to take with you. The drops you can receive range from a bundle of potions to wild single-use spellbooks. From Dreadwind Flasks to Zapwater Urns, from Pouches of the Wasted to Satchels of Errants, or from Evermore Tea to a vial of Tears for the Fallen; the loot pool is massive!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/723370/extras/c0712481088b2745be10623b2f0a114d.poster.avif?t=1545666841\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/723370/extras/c0712481088b2745be10623b2f0a114d.webm?t=1545666841\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/723370/extras/c0712481088b2745be10623b2f0a114d.mp4?t=1545666841\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>. There are relics to collect. They can be found in all sorts of places, and they provide nuggets of lore. In the future, a museum of sorts will be added for their placement.<br><br>. Your main party is composed of four classes. Eveline Spiritbird is a Paladin; Hawk Starlight is a Knight; Raine Meadowlark is an Archer and Amber Farfaith is an Aid Mage.<br><br>. Faria and The World is mostly a good place, free from roving bandits and political corruption. The Farian are loyal to themselves and adversity stems from the wild creatures of the kingdom and the Voidborn. The latter include vile orcs, vicious saurians, twisted demons, sickly trolls an many more. The universe is deeper than one may expect, as it straddles the line between high-fantasy and sci-fi the further you go.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/723370/extras/b921709fb75114cabcc363130126083f.poster.avif?t=1545666841\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/723370/extras/b921709fb75114cabcc363130126083f.webm?t=1545666841\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/723370/extras/b921709fb75114cabcc363130126083f.mp4?t=1545666841\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
