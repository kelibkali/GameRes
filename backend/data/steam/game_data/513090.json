    "description": "Introduced into service in 1910, the ‘Barnum’ coaches have a slightly American style due to incorporating design elements from the Barnum &amp; Bailey circus train coaches also designed by the GCR around the same time. The design also did away with traditional panelling in favour of clean, smooth lower body panels with teak edging. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Barnum Coach Pack 01 for Train Simulator includes BT and OT variants in LNER Teak and British Railway Crimson &amp; Crimson liveries.",
