    "description": "everybody's sad is a a weird, therapeutic, kinetic VR experience about learning to balance self care and care for others.  Use intuitive motion and pose-based controls to make sad, alive objects happy!  But who will make you happy?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe wanted to provide players with an experimental VR experience that pushes the envelope of what VR games can be.  By making players use their voices and bodies in new ways, we provide them with a more immersive experience in which they can discover the delicate balance between caring for others and themselves.  Through this game, we wanted to emphasize the importance of balancing caring for others and caring for yourself, as well as innovating what games can do in VR.",
