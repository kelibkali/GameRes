Its intuitive controls and addictive gameplay were the result of 8-bit influences such as Mario Bros, Bubble Bobble, Joust and Balloon Fight. What separates Blockhead 2D from the rest of those classic but cute games of old is the violent and disgusting techniques these siblings use to stomp each other's heads in to win the bout. It's easy to pick up and play, yet requires skill and timing to master. With local LAN and split-screen, it's sure to recapture the memories of sitting on the couch and playing competitively with friends and family.</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The goal of Blockhead 2D is dependent on the gamemode. For the <strong>Player VS CPU singleplayer mode</strong>, you must defeat your opponent by using your various special moves and jumping on their head. In the <strong>splitscreen and LAN modes</strong>, it's much the same, but with friends!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >There are, however, unique gamemodes that were developed during certain holidays, each of them having a different goal!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2062800/extras/43415addd08dcb3ca4248fd1460d126e.avif?t=1763791092\" width=300 height=100 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >In this gamemode, you are greeted by gloomy lighting and music to fit the level.
