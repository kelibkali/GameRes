They live beside humans hiding their nature or walking among them unseen. And most people go about their lives entirely unaware of the dangers around them. Mysterious situations are written off as fake, or they're glossed over with some sort of mundane explanation. <br><br>The same was true for Nora, a normal girl struggling with the usual litany of everyday problems - including her crumbling relationship with an angry, resentful twin brother with whom she's nearly given up on reconciling. <br><br>But her family's return to the town in which she'd grown up set in motion a chain of events that would shatter every illusion she had about a world she thought she knew.
