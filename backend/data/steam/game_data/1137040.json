    "description": "<u><strong>CAT &amp; MOUSE IS MULTIPLAYER ONLY. There is no Singleplayer gameplay aside from a tutorial and level exploration mode. Single player is currently Work in progress.</strong> </u><br><br>CAT &amp; MOUSE is a fast paced, asymmetrical, multiplayer game where you play a game of well.. cat and mouse. Mice run and hide from Cats while trying to grab as much food as they can before they either starve or run out of time, while Cats hunt down the mice to win. Players will need to try to outsmart and outmaneuver each other to accomplish their goals.<br><br>CAT &amp; MOUSE is currently Peer to Peer Multiplayer only, meaning there are <strong>no public dedicated servers</strong> or any form of Single player at this time. I am currently in the process of finishing up the first iteration of bots/Single player and have no date or plans for dedicated servers, but this may change in the future.<br><br>Cats will usually be outnumbered, but are highly maneuverable, fast and can listen for Mice through walls if the Mice are moving. Cats also have a constant cone of light beaming from their eyes, warning Mice of where they are looking (along with a loud warning sound), but if a Cat is sneaking this light turns off, allowing for ambushes or hiding, but leaves the Cat mostly stationary while who knows how many Mice are sneaking around in the open.<br><br>Mice are much slower than Cats, moving at about half the speed, but are tiny in comparison, able to hide under a cup, climb walls, squeeze through cracks or under doors, run through tiny gaps in the wall or under furniture, and if cornered have a last ditch 'Dash' ability that can be used to get to high places or to quickly jump out of the way of a Cat. <br><br>Most players' first experience of CAT &amp; MOUSE is the Cat seems overpowered, being way faster and more agile, and winning easily, but through time, players' opinions swing to the opposite, feeling that its far too easy being Mice, this continues to flip flop until each player has mastered being either a Cat or a Mouse. This is where players unlock the true mechanics of the game, turning into a mind game, a game of quick thinking, a game of abusing your enemies disadvantages and utilizing your advantages, a game of cornering your friends, a game of lies, a game of talking trash to someone only to be smashed into a yellow stain on the ground, a game of <strong>thinking</strong> you have someone cornered, a game of hoping the coast is clear and finding out it is indeed not clear, a game of cat and mouse.<br><br>Thanks for playing my stupid game!<br><br>If you have one, join the Discord:   - I am always online and will be posting there far more frequently than the steam page.<br>Check out the Roadmap/Current WIP on my Trello Board :  - This will be updated more as I get use to updating it.",
