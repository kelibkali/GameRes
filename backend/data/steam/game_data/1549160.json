Seated across from him was his childhood friend, Shiho. With that said, while they've known each other for a long time, they aren't particularly close. While nursing soft drinks in the aftermath of a group date event, Shiho muses about relationships when she suddenly proposes the idea of practicing how to be in a relationship and makes Yukihisa her partner. Practice would give them both confidence when they decide to pursue a partner in the future but perhaps there's more to Shiho's proposal?<br><br>And thus, Yukihisa and Shiho's practice as boyfriend and girlfriend begins.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Visual novel with 2 possible endings<br></li><li>Japanese language voice acting (Shiho only)<br></li><li>Voiced line playback<br></li><li>History/backlog function</li></ul>",
