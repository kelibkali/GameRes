    "description": "You are a moonbase worker serving a four year contract. Strange events start happening and it becomes more and more evident that someone is out to kill you. The only problem is, there are only two of you on the moon, separated in two different bases on each side of a crater. You cannot go to the opposite base and your colleague cannot go to yours. Is it your colleague who is trying to kill you or is there a third person hiding on the moon?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen playing The Crater, you will have to use the environment to solve puzzles and problems. Explore the Moonbase and the crater to unravel the mystery piece by piece.",
