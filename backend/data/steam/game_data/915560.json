    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story</h2><br>Somewhere in Hokkaido lies a small village of fairies, once known to the locals as 'Koropokkur.' As times changed, their village prohibited its residents from interacting with the human world and the Koropokkur were long forgotten. <br><br>However, a few of these young Koropokkur became fascinated with the human world and gazed upon it through a magic viewing pool. Asirrera, in particular, was enamored with an ancient Koropokkur legend of a young girl who ventured out into the human world, became human through the grace of Kanda's Kamuy, the local deity, and found love with a human man.<br><br>Asirrera summons up her courage to break the village laws and see the human world for herself, using her magic to transform into as small as an apple to human-sized!<br><br>Unfortunately, her clumsiness quickly gets the better of her and ruins Satoru's last ditch efforts to save the maid cafe he runs in Akihabara. Plagued with guilt, she offers to help make amends and winds up working with Satoru to help revive the cafe.<br><br>After seeing her plight through the viewing pool, her friends, Cirta and Haruante, leave the village to help. While they're both supportive of Asirrera, they also seem worried by her lack of urgency in fulfilling her true goal...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A Kick-started visual novel!<br></li><li>Multi-platform Support!<br></li><li>References to real-world environments!<br></li><li>Lots of Maids! </li></ul>",
