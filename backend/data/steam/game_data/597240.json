    "description": "This is johns.game, a Wasteland Survival Game. <br>You are here on Naben, a cold desert wasteland full of criminal activity, death, and loneliness. After fighting off the people who killed your only family you find yourself having nothing left but the two hands in front of you.<br> <br>The world is quickly taking a darker turn. People will die, blood will lay ways to the surface of the orange, gray earth. The world will burn under your feet as the people around you fear you. You are John, a man with a cliche name and a hidden story of ethics. You don't care, you control someone with no morals and he will do anything. John... he will burn the world down, break every bone, slaughter every child, and find his truth. Do you want to know what happens in the end? John dies. Everyone dies in the end, it's just the hard truth. I am speaking to you, I just wish you would listen.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Included Features:</h2>Some features that have batteries included:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Minipulation;<br></li><li>In-Depth Questing;<br></li><li>Guns;<br></li><li>Farming;<br></li><li>Cooking;<br></li><li>Fire;<br></li><li>Death;<br></li><li>Explosions;<br></li><li>Deadly Shovels;<br></li><li>Sexy Ambient Music;<br></li><li>More Death;<br></li><li>Towns &amp; Locations;<br></li><li>Weapons &amp; Vehicles;<br></li><li>Unique People;<br></li><li>MUCH MUCH MORE!;<br></li><li>HOW HAVE YOU NOT BOUGHT THIS YET?!; <br></li><li>.</li></ul><br><strong>Extra info from here down</strong><br>If you find a bug or have something you think would be a good fit, please feel free to message the dev directly, complain on Twitter or just post in the disscusions in the community hub.<br><br>The game is moderately complicated and involves a lot of thought. There are real world aspects (for example, lighting a fire using fire, breaking a snowman gives you snow, etc.) for a slightly more realistic tone. This game is pretty community driven in the sense that if you want something you just ask.<br><br><br><br>[A Note from the Developer]<br>8/2/2024| I appreciate those who still stumble across this game to give it a shot. It is by no means amazing. It is mainly here as an artifact rather than a game. <br><br>The &quot;game&quot; consists of several games, and versions of said games. It was one of my first games. The fact that people still look at this tells me all I need to know. I am currently working on a new Sandbox experience.<br><br>Not only was this series (I guess it's a series?) of games over-complicated (besides the various RTS versions), but a lot of the controls were &quot;bad&quot;. Pressing A+Space to punch in the left direction isn't exactly good game design for survival games. <br><br>I do not believe anyone has completed any of the survival games/prototypes as of today and it's been about 8 years.<br><br>Wow, 8 years. That's crazy.<br><br>Also, I'm almost 23. For context, I made this game at 14 (not 15) and eventually got it and another game Greenlit. Anyone remember that?",
