Battle your way through diverse and progressively more capable and difficult enemies and bosses in order to escape from dark and depressive medieval nightmare. Successfully slashing your way out with your trusty longsword will fuel an array of destructive and defensive spells that you can unleash and wreak havoc on your enemies all while dashing around of harms way.",
