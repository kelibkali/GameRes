I got up, went to the general store, bought some seeds, planted them. Cooked some spaghetti bolognese, went out to chop wood. Milked my cows, fed them too. Got in my boat, went underwater with my diving suit. Found a cave entrance, fought a giant crab, grabbed some treasure. Got back up, went to the showroom for a drink. I think the hotel owner's daughter is throwing funny glances at me. I shouldn't have gifted her that boot I fished out the other day...&quot;</i><br><br><strong>For those of you who are in for the farming...</strong><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/786580/extras/3486c0f7c60360175203d875816dd971.webp?t=1667031435\" width=68 height=56 /></span>  Grab your trusty tools and transform your farm into the richest field in town!
