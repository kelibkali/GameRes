Because rusty metal can get a bit monotone after a while.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Seasonal updates.</strong> Because Santa's hats and winter mittens are Metal AF.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>MORE METAL.</strong> For every mini-game created, a new music track comes with it.

There is currently no ETA for any console release, but you will be notified when it will be available. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>WHY DID YOU MAKE METAL HEADS?</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Metal Heads is a passion project, and something I (Nathan Francis) want to play when my friends come over, or whenever there is a party games night. I enjoy making things and seeing the reaction of others when they see and experience what I have made, especially when what I make, causes people to laugh and have a great time. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >I also love party games, it's a great way for friends to get together, and online party games are a great way to meet new friends, however I wanted to create a party game where up to 8 people could play, so that nobody misses out on the fun. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>WHEN WILL METAL HEADS RELEASE?</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >There is no definitive ETA yet, but Metal Heads aims to release into early access in Q1 2021, allowing you to support the game and get access to new content as I develop it in preparation for the full game launch later on (hopefully 2023 or 2024).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >As a solo developer, I have relied on a day job for income, it is difficult to maintain such a mammoth task of working 12-16 hours every single day, it is easy to burn-out so I need to be smart about how I work, and the future is unpredictable, so delays may happen, or ...hopefully, massive burst in productivity happen, and I can get Metal Heads out to you all sooner. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Either way, no matter if Metal Heads gets buried, or if it becomes huge, I will still work on it, because I enjoy it, I am making the party game that I want to play. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>WILL THE DMCA DEMONS STRIKE ME DOWN ON FOR PLAYING THE GAME ON TWITCH OR YOUTUBE?</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >NOPE! And if they do, contact me immediately and I'll strike those demons myself!</p>",
