A little robot that is to serve as nothing more than as one of the many robotic minions owned by the evil tyrant, Garrison, it realizes that being in such a position is no rewarding task. As the robot itself, you must stop Garrison's forces from the inside before they take over the world! <br><br>Play through the levels in any order you wish. Venture through the Sky Base, Disco Palace, and Underground Lair before finishing the job off in the treacherous Garrison Fortress!
