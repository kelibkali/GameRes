However, the sound and smell of fire does not give you the time to contemplate the situation. Danger drives you out into the world, cold, and deadly darkness surrounding you. However, into the oblivion of your existence comes Ester. A small girl who serves as the eyes for the blind man and your connection to the world. Her words serve as your sight, painting the world into a horrific image filled with peril. Even this friendship is tenuous... distant memories haunt you. Your doomed past chases your dreams and threatens your desperate journey in search of safety and help.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/644330/extras/7b57a2e306d92bae364b9b9eeb77d344.webp?t=1533149081\" width=160 height=50 /></span><br><br><br>This is an indie developed project using overhead sprite art. This game is over world adventure style, requiring the player to discover the world not through the character's sight, but through feeling, sound, smell, and your companion, Ester's, insight. Monsters emerge from the darkness to attack, requiring real-time combat. (Although running from all enemies you find will keep you and your companion alive).<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/644330/extras/8b748b0acdfcfa3da8a97eb70b1119cb.avif?t=1533149081\" width=606 height=454 /></span><br><br>Because you can not depend on your sight, for all maps, you must explore a mostly black screen, slowly filling it in as you feel around.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/644330/extras/99243c0c1861ff3cf6b7d86a243423b2.avif?t=1533149081\" width=624 height=472 /></span><br><br>Eventually, you fill the map as you discover more and more.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/644330/extras/743ff4aeacd511fb653e47539d0afeaf.avif?t=1533149081\" width=640 height=480 /></span><br><br>Using both Esters guidance, sounds, and other cues, you will navigate, while avoiding monsters and other dangers.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/644330/extras/0ca41995fda0813781d854bde9ef5e09.avif?t=1533149081\" width=190 height=282 /></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/644330/extras/a797be420fb3cc37c9f40967d6bc16ba.avif?t=1533149081\" width=190 height=282 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/644330/extras/967a56e3748c2849e3a0eaf128f92ad3.avif?t=1533149081\" width=160 height=238 /></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/644330/extras/a85d5db6e1d7a2a11414aa429c44bf48.avif?t=1533149081\" width=190 height=282 /></span>",
