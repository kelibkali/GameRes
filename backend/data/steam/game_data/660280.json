    "description": "Keep It Safe is a game, where the players take control of a vehicle, racing through a hilly terrain, so that they can transport various cargo to the final destination (the market), keeping it safe. Their goal is to accumulate as much finances as they can to unlock the next vehicle or level, each different from the other. Race to the finish, but keep the cargo safe at the same time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTransporting goods, like fruit or other various cargo, will earn you money which you can use to upgrade your car or truck for easier transportation of goods to the market. Alternatively you can unlock new levels.",
