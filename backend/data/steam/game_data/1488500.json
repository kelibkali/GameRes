    "description": "The Adventures on Uranus is a short interactive experience. The game provides a chance to explore the imaginary planet of Uranus for a few minutes. There are pyramids, towers, and a town center to explore - watch out for one fun surprise when the button is pushed! There are no enemies or objectives, it's just a short and sweet exploration game. Created using the Unreal Engine, this is the first title by John Borkowski and Alex Lamontange, two teenagers who share a passion for video gaming.",
