    "description": "<strong>the office simulation</strong> is a first person interactive story driven game. Play as Tim when you wake up in the same office building everyday... but this time something is amok. Walk around the office and follow the story of a lifetime. You explore an entire office building while getting more information on what is truly going on. The office building is filled with puzzles and platforming.<br><br>From the second the Game Jam started, <i>The Stanley Parable</i> was the clear inspiration, but with games like <i>Portal 2</i> heavily inspiring the story.",
