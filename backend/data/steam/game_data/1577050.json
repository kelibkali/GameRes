You'll have to jump from vehicle to vehicle in order to grow and maintain your self-acquired-fleet as you pilot them single-handedly through the enemy forces. <br>It's a unique genre-mix of Platformer, Shootemup, and a bit of Towerdefense. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1577050/extras/7c44be125d06948e0cd48433157de703.poster.avif?t=1734360711\" width=616 height=260 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1577050/extras/7c44be125d06948e0cd48433157de703.webm?t=1734360711\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1577050/extras/7c44be125d06948e0cd48433157de703.mp4?t=1734360711\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Innovative new game concept that combines platforming with shootemup gameplay in a truly unique way.<br></li><li>Tons of different vehicle-types.<br></li><li>Steal, dismantle and built vehicles, and take them to other missions.<br></li><li>Assemble your own personal fleet to lead assaults into the monster realm!<br></li><li>Defeat big boss-monsters.<br></li><li>Unique scoring system by breakdancing on vehicles.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1577050/extras/5a66f8894715434306c0851b59856f81.avif?t=1734360711\" width=616 height=292 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story</h2>You’re part of a small resistance fighting against a tyrant set on world domination.
