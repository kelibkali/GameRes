She spends most of her days staring at the bottom of a bottle of booze as though it might have something to say. That is, until a man dies in her arms.  A man from whom she hears a story about a way to bring free water to a desperate land.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368540/extras/3aa67dfcc1e64fa09cfd417d88f0cc4d.poster.avif?t=1728135934\" width=640 height=232 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368540/extras/3aa67dfcc1e64fa09cfd417d88f0cc4d.webm?t=1728135934\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368540/extras/3aa67dfcc1e64fa09cfd417d88f0cc4d.mp4?t=1728135934\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >An adventure game for the modern era...</h2>With adventure gameplay focused more on choices than pixel hunting or moon logic puzzles.

We have dubbed it a 'puzzle shooter' because we think we're clever. It combines classic point and click gameplay with rail shooter elements, strong characters, and a deep well thought out setting in which water is more valuable than blood.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368540/extras/dd2de7ea8c375c2029f45709843865d2.poster.avif?t=1728135934\" width=636 height=232 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368540/extras/dd2de7ea8c375c2029f45709843865d2.webm?t=1728135934\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368540/extras/dd2de7ea8c375c2029f45709843865d2.mp4?t=1728135934\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A vibrant yet dying world for you to explore...</h2>The world of Dead Horizon is not one of infinite frontiers.  It is a setting of pain and bones bleached white by a world that wants nothing more than to consume what few people are left on its surface. Yet, those people still live their lives, have their own stories, dreams, and aspirations. A dying world doesn't mean that people don't live.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368540/extras/200471e836b3bec98b6f6a90b4f630d9.poster.avif?t=1728135934\" width=640 height=232 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368540/extras/200471e836b3bec98b6f6a90b4f630d9.webm?t=1728135934\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368540/extras/200471e836b3bec98b6f6a90b4f630d9.mp4?t=1728135934\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Hard Sell...</h2>Dead Horizon is a game with one foot firmly in the past: adventure games, the 90s, pixel art and some older design philosophies. However, it is also a game with one foot firmly in the future: interaction, immersion, cinematic storytelling, and reactive dialogues. By taking the style and lessons of the past and combining them with both modern game design elements and a love of storytelling, we've tried to create something beautiful.<br><br>Dead Horizon is a labor of love. A love of storytelling, of pixel art, of westerns, of so many things. A love of gamers and games. Of the people who have come before and everyone that will come after.<br><br>We hope you are willing to celebrate this love with us. Even when all we see around us are Dead Horizons, those barren sands are full of beauty.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368540/extras/76bb157ac833aa2d7b0db8e28e866888.avif?t=1728135934\" width=666 height=268 /></span>",
