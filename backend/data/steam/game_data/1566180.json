A multi-prong attack consisting of naval invasions and para drops took place all over the island. By the 3rd day, the fighting was over. <br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1566180/extras/fa8749d03405907a8aef37a0f42e1a9f.avif?t=1614880273\" width=616 height=140 /></span><br>'Heroes of Grenada' brings to life this conflict with US Marines, Rangers, and SEALs supported by AC-130Hs face off against the Grenadian military and Cuban troops.
