    "description": "The Official Soundtrack to <i>Pendragon</i>, composed by Laurence Chapman and performed by Leos Strings.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >An Introduction by Laurence Chapman, composer</h2><br>After finishing Heaven’s Vault it was a thrill to be asked again by inkle to score one of their games. And what a contrast! From following Aliya through the nebula and worlds of Heaven’s Vault, I found myself wandering through the forests and courts of Arthurian England.<br><br>Central to the music is Arthur’s Call  which wends its way through the score in a variety of guises before triumphantly re-emerging in the finale, Camlaan Passacaglia. My thanks to Jack Pilcher-May for bringing this theme to life so wonderfully.<br><br>A huge thank you to Rachel Shakespeare at Brookspeare Music and all the musicians who were able to adapt to the Covid-19 restrictions and record the score with their usual flair and professionalism.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Pendragon Band</h2><br><strong>Violins:</strong> Elaine Ambridge, Elise Harper &amp; Naomi Rump<br><strong>Violas:</strong> Simon Howes &amp; Laurie Dempsey<br><strong>Cello:</strong> Rachel Shakespeare<br><strong>Flutes:</strong> Helen Wilson<br><strong>Clarinets:</strong> Tom Evans<br><strong>Horn:</strong> Jack Pilcher-May<br><strong>Harp:</strong> Olivia Jaguers<br><strong>Piano &amp; Tambourine:</strong> Laurence Chapman",
