    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Meander Map Pack City Expansions I</h2>This exciting new series of map packs will finally open up the option for building huge destinations to which all the other hundreds of Meanders can lead.<br>This pack features a huge assortment of 30 New Maps from my Fantasy City Kickstarter with a range of new variations to enhance your existing Fantasy City. These include an Ashen city set, that matches up to a Raging Inferno set so you can have both the action of a fire and the aftermath. An Overgrown and Ruined set so you can show the passage of time - or the past. An Ensorcelled Set so you can get your players face to face with magical challenges, rogue mages and sorcerous threats and events - and a trail of cryptic murder scenes with grisly surroundings to add intrigue.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>6 x Overgrown City Variation Maps<br></li><li>6 x Ashen City Variation Maps<br></li><li>6 x Raging Inferno Variation Maps<br></li><li>5 x Ensorcelled/Magic-Afflicted Variation Maps<br></li><li>3 x Ruined Variation Maps<br></li><li>4 x Murder Scene Variation Maps</li></ul>Maps are sized specially for FG at 1350x900 and under 500 kb each to help prevent slow-down during play. DM Convenience is the focus with carefully labelled maps and several ways to access, use and choose the maps in this module. Use the VISUAL MAP SELECTION PANEL and pick your map from the thumbnails and yellow label by clicking on the pin. Or use the RANDOM ROLL TABLES to pick your destination at random.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong></strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and any ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
