    "description": "Ukraine Defense Force Tactics is a turn-based tactics game in which you lead a small force of Ukrainian units fighting against a seemingly endless deluge of Russian invaders. You will have to outsmart and outmaneuver an overwhelming force of enemies using combined infantry-and-armor tactics and an array of special Stratagems.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay</h2>Your goal is to destroy as many enemies as possible before needing to retreat your forces. By defeating enemies you gain Glory which then can be used to upgrade your units and unlock new ones.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Intuitive yet deep <strong>turn-based combat system</strong> will allow you to jump right in into gameplay while still being entertaining and fun after many hours. We all know the drill: move, attack and then it's the enemy turn… But what if you could pick up Action Points from fallen enemies and actually never give up initiative, defeating all of them in a single turn?<br></li><li>Stratagems are <strong>special abilities</strong> that can alter the course of battle in a single moment. Call in precision drone strikes, disrupt enemy supply lines or even alter fundamental gameplay mechanics to outsmart your enemies.<br></li><li>Unlock new units and army compositions while gradually upgrading your units to <strong>customize</strong> your strategy.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Note</h2>Ukraine Defense Force Tactics is a charity project. All of the developer's profits from the sale of the game will go towards supporting Ukraine.",
