If less than the minimum number of players have registered for a tournament, such a tournament is canceled.<br>In this tournament, each participant of the tournament must meet each other during the fight. The order of players' participation will be determined by the time of registration to the tournament. According to the results of each fight the participant is awarded a certain number of points. The participant who scored the greatest number of points as a result of all matches is considered the winner. In case of equality of points between two or several participants, the winner is determined in accordance with the regulations on the tournament. For the distribution of places in case of equal number of points, the additional Berger coefficient is applied.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Olympic system</h2><br>In this tournament system, the participant leaves the tournament after the first loss of one match. <br>In tournaments of this system an even number of players takes part. In the first round all boxers are ordered by rating. If the rating is the same, the next sign is the number of victories, then the alphabet. Pairs are composed according to the principle: the first from the upper half of the table with the first from the lower half, the second - with the second, and so on. In each round of participants are made up pairs playing among themselves. <br>The participant who won the final bout, becomes the winner. Draw in games of this system is impossible. Winning is determined by the referee's account. If the score is equal, the following conditions apply: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>- the winner is determined by the last blow (who struck, he won),<br></li><li>- in case there are no hits at all, the victory is awarded randomly without rating.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >&quot;Swiss system&quot;</h2>Number of participants: min. 7 players max. 1024 players.

Pairs are formed according to the principle: the first from the upper half of the table with the first from the lower half, the second - with the second, and so on. If the number of players is odd, the player with the last number gets a point without playing.<br>In the following rounds, all players shall be divided into groups with the same number of points scored. Thus, after the first round of groups will be three: winners, losers and draws. If the group has an odd number of players, one player shall be transferred to the next point group.<br>Opponents for the next round are made up of one point group in the same way as in the first round, the rating principle (the best boxer from the upper half of the group if possible meets with the best boxer from the lower half of this group). At the same time, however, it is not allowed that the same pair participates in the tournament more than one match. With an odd number of opponents, a boxer who has the last number in the last point group (from those who have not yet received a point for a pass), gets a point without a fight.<br>Places in the tournament are distributed according to the accumulated number of points.<br>The participants with the equal number of points are distributed according to the Buchholz's coefficient, which is determined as a sum of points, gained by all competitors of the given player in the tournament.<br><br>For all types of Tournaments in case of the same result:<br>In the case where the boxers have the same number of points and used other protocols for assigning places for an equal result, the organizer has the right to determine the stronger player himself.<br>-------------------------------<br><br>Cyber Fight Challenge <br>Nordville company created a boxing simulator for PC which is capable of traversing gamers to a captivating boxing universe.
