Each and every descent will lead to new adventures, where only the most determined players with many risked lives will be rewarded by the hidden world that lies below.<br><br>Discover treasures worth dwarven death for. Within the stone below lies the adventure every dwarf worth their beard seeks, but there's always a price. Often death. Explore and pillage many cavern layers, and over 25+ planned biomes.<br><br>Each level deeper lies more dangerous biomes, yet also greater rewards to mine and uncover.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1170230/extras/e22aee95fcc313f107b4406a29c2b378.avif?t=1771558428\" width=630 height=130 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1170230/extras/11a8a5a15f650cdf2441606ee2696f85.avif?t=1771558428\" width=630 height=709 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1170230/extras/dbf0bf0acf6e6d6ee3c492db242b7c5a.avif?t=1771558428\" width=630 height=130 /></span><br><br>The Dwarven kingdom is your place for crafting, preparation, and storing loot for later expeditions. You have control over what resources you choose to keep at home safe and sound, and what equipment you dare wear with you on your next cave dive. The only catch is<strong> if you die, you will lose all the items you took down</strong> into the caves on your dwarf - such is the cost of progress!  Additionally, your stay in the dwarven kingdom will yield an ever-growing cast of allies to aid you on your adventures below the surface. For example...<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1170230/extras/83e110fd186c2aeea922b09f08ae64d2.avif?t=1771558428\" width=630 height=379 /></span><br><br>A dwarf's best friend is someone who can turn shiny things into useful tools. The Blacksmith is the reliable friend to give you proper weaponry, armor, and equipment for your future descents.
