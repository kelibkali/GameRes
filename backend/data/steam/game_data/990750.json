    "description": "<strong>RoboSnakes: Core Wars Legacy</strong> is a game created from dreams of a game, where your mechanical skill, age, dexterity or equipment won’t give you any major advantage, a game where nothing but your intellect could give you an edge on your opponent, player and AI alike.<br><br>The effect of those dreams is a game with a completely new idea of the word <strong>multiplayer</strong>. You will never need to queue up and wait for other people since the players of RoboSnakes leave their mark on the game <strong>forever.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What are Core Wars and why the name Core Wars Legacy?</h2><br>During prehistoric times, or 1984 to be exact, when no one even dreamed about a serious video game market an idea was born. An idea that fascinated us and inspired us. Core Wars in the memories of virtual machines gave birth to games about robot battles in a virtual platform.<br>This game is our tribute and homage to the original idea and the entire community, which to this day cultivates this original game.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/990750/extras/03d35e004c20d02501e936c9a83076fe.poster.avif?t=1551871331\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/990750/extras/03d35e004c20d02501e936c9a83076fe.webm?t=1551871331\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/990750/extras/03d35e004c20d02501e936c9a83076fe.mp4?t=1551871331\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Simple and easy to learn, but powerful visual programming system.</strong><br>This game isn’t designed for hardcore programmers.
