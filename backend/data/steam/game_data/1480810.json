It is divided by differing ideals and flooded with mistrust. A siege leads to a civil war, and the civil war threatens the stability of the entire kingdom as each dukedom competes in a race for Wendalle’s throne.<br><br>One of these dukedoms, Swozalta, is ruled by Duke Arsenio Duran, a cruel and cunning man with a sinister plot to acquire higher power and a higher standing within the kingdom. He crushes all those who stand in his way but one opponent seems elusive - a small group of rebels that are persistent in their quest to expose and defeat him. However, the duke’s powerful military is slowly but surely routing this rebellion, and it is slowly becoming obvious that its days are numbered.<br><br>You find yourself here. What will you choose? What decisions will you make? Will you value the lives of your comrades, or use them as you see fit? Will you choose to help those in need, or help yourself because your ideals seem clearer? Whatever you choose will change the course of Swozalta, and of the entire kingdom of Wendalle.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1480810/extras/cb56e04760ceda135b35933b7c24c25a.poster.avif?t=1726828098\" width=600 height=250 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1480810/extras/cb56e04760ceda135b35933b7c24c25a.webm?t=1726828098\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1480810/extras/cb56e04760ceda135b35933b7c24c25a.mp4?t=1726828098\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Crimson Tactics is heavily influenced by games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre.
