They rise to fame and become superstars in the media because of two important tools.<br><br>The first are ghost producers they hire to make music for them so they can release it under their names. The second is a dangerous power brought from the Pit of Averno. This mystical evil power is called MONEY.<br><br>These evil creatures are known as Devil Goata, Paul Douchebag, Paris Sheraton, Steve Karaoki and Pete Bullshit.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1207390/extras/32ff0b004c73f04dac862298032f8ca4.poster.avif?t=1581019279\" width=579 height=105 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1207390/extras/32ff0b004c73f04dac862298032f8ca4.webm?t=1581019279\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>Their goal is to destroy the love for the music in this universe by making all of it to sound the same and stupid, using a terrifying and malicious artifact known as THE TEMPLATE.<br><br>There is still chance for real music to survive.
