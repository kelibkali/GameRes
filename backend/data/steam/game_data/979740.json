Delve down into the abyss and discover the secrets lying under the abandoned excavation site, which was closed down in mysterious circumstances. Solve interesting mechanical puzzles and overcome challenges ؘ– and if you’re observant enough, you’ll find clues, sketches, and notes, which will shed light onto the dark history of Profundum.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/979740/extras/15f342763acd67afc5172b32afbddb23.poster.avif?t=1611828458\" width=600 height=226 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/979740/extras/15f342763acd67afc5172b32afbddb23.webm?t=1611828458\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>The puzzles in this game are based on natural interactions between objects you’ll find in the game world and its environment, and often involve strange but beautiful industrial machinery.

Profundum boasts realistic, high fidelity graphics and physics. Gears generate friction that moves them, chains will slack and transfer movement between the gears, and jets of steam will proper fan blades thanks to accurate particle simulation. We understand the VR needs to be smooth to work, and Profundum has been optimized to provide a fluid experience even on reasonable configurations. See for yourself… if you dare!",
