    "description": "In this ultra-retro 64 x 64 mining game, you are a subterranean cosmonaut cultivator on a mission to find the Atlas Globe, a treasure only told in legend! Originally created for “Low Rez Jam”, this is an expanded version of the game that you can play for free! Its length is designed for single session playthroughs like the Atari games of old, but it’s procedural nature gives it replayability in a way that those old games did not.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/899530/extras/23f3cde7dd919c98f52120aec70ba1f6.avif?t=1533669552\" width=621 height=85 /></span><br><br>Use your mining laser to dig through a procedurally-generated world. The world gets tougher as you descend ever further, but the rewards are richer.<br><br>There are other living things that lurk below the surface, and some loose rocks that may fall on you, so watch your head and use your mining laser!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/899530/extras/ad829dd1be185822ad80bf72e8e83e51.avif?t=1533669552\" width=621 height=142 /></span><br>Uncover and harvest various mineral deposits, and collect the dropped ore to fund your excavation! But don’t be too greedy and neglect your resources: Losing all your health, or self-destructing because you got stuck in the caves with no means of climbing out, will reduce your carried amount of money.<br><br>And those monsters you encounter? Some of them may drop fuel if you fight them.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/899530/extras/eab2d275bf3863794adba73718fecbed.avif?t=1533669552\" width=621 height=85 /></span><br><br>Need a better laser to rip through the planet? Have low health from scuffling with the local wildlife? Need larger fuel reserves for longer trips under the surface? Return to the shop on the surface for some equipment upgrades! Be sure to plan your exit strategy as you dig, because you’d rather want to return to the shop by your own volition than to return because you made a mistake!",
