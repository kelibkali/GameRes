    "description": "Explore the city of Florie in the lower district, a place where the guards oppresses the working people. Death is common and starving people will ask you for food. Play as Arridaios, one of the leading members of the rebellion. People look up to him and hope that their revolt will succeed. But Arridaios is reluctant in helping the people. He wants to live in what little peace he has. Things don't go the way as planned. Arridaios discovers that his friend went missing. And along the way in finding him, he sees something he dreads. Something he never wants to see again. Far worse than the oppression of King Leuric.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJoin the discord to keep tabs on future game created by Yobob!<br />\r\nhttps://discord.gg/BFJGHd8",
