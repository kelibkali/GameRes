Its a hardened server so that others cannot bring down this game. The game records Internet Protocols and will auto ban where there is trouble. No MUD can do this as well as ours. You are protected! You can run this server along side any other server, including game servers. The design of our firewall is  low impact to your system, and will sleep itself to save processor time, other than listening on its redirectional ports of course.

Telnet servers are the hidden dark web of fun with spiders with all kinds of mobs with powerful spells! Many have dated in these games and put a ring in real life right on that special finger; these are CHAT servers you could easily meet the right person and make friends, the communities are great, maybe meet your wildest dream in a text MUD its possible! We just need to make text gaming easy to access again, here it is!!</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This is not an epic 3D Game, in fact it is 2.50 Dimensional. This is the first working and designed TEXT Ascii RPG with EVERYTHING the others have, so why does it have to be 3D, it doesn't. Human beings, when we imagine it, it comes to life, many say they do not have an imagination, I bet you were thinking about breakfast when you woke up.

You can play other games while playing this game, and we all like to do that as we wait for graphical games to launch our 3D virtual playgrounds. City of Ages' game design is similar to top graphical games of the same concept, some laptops do not have a graphical card, here is a text variation to toy with. This game also has Artificial Intelligence built right into the server code. City of Ages' game will slowly offer you mini games while you play, Egg you on for fights the next time you log in and many more AI-like features!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Our finished client allows you to make macros, edit buttons, you have timers that repeat any command including your Attack target commands [no grind no beating on your keyboard required], or use timers to practice your spells FOR YOU, does the word IDLE game mean anything to you all?
