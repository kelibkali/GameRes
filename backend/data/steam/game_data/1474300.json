You may think you've seen everything the convention scene has to offer, but you've never gone to a con like MonCon.<br><br>In MonCon, you will take control of Joey, a young teenager struggling with social anxiety. Joey has decided to attend MonCon in the hopes of meeting his hero, legendary game designer Mr. Miyashiro, and getting an autograph.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1474300/extras/498ae8ea167ec919dfc5861ab612fdb0.avif?t=1749314351\" width=625 height=153 /></span><br>​<br>But for Joey, a normal conversation feels like a fight to the death. Through his eyes, <strong>ordinary people transform into hideous monsters</strong> that must be verbally battled to survive. He'll have to spar with dozens of monstrous personalities in a psychedelic, rhythm-based battle system - at least, that's how it seems in his own mind...<br><br>But Joey's not alone. With the help of a boisterous self-described geek named Karl, and a fiery investigative podcaster named Marnie, Joey will start to overcome his social hang-ups, and learn that not everyone you meet is a monster.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1474300/extras/1fb096993c8923fe8014a795061f0cb1.avif?t=1749314351\" width=625 height=153 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Big Announcement!</h2><br>Kicking things off at the start of the day, Mondoton plans to give the world its first look at their next game - <i>Run Boy 3D</i>, the brand-new, fully immersive game that can only be experienced in virtual reality!

The only thing you should have to be afraid of while playing <i>Run Boy 3D</i> is those virtual monsters running straight towards you!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Will Mondoton's main competitor be attending the event?</h2><br>Mondoton's major competitor, Sadagemu, will not be making an appearance at this year's event, despite an open invitation. The founder of Sadagemu has declined to comment.<br><br>---<br><br>MonCon (C) Megalithic Mainframe 2024<br>All rights reserved.",
