II am now aware that at present the game has an issue with Valve Index controller. Players using the Valve Index are unable to grab the weapon and move. I will be looking at fixing this as soon as I can. I have only been able to play test this using Meta Quest 3 so I apologize for any issues.<br><br><br>This VR Game was built and runs on the OpenXR SDK.",
