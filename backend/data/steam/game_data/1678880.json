    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >ABOUT SEARING</h2><br>SeaRing is a 2D indie action-puzzle, putting a devilish twist on its predecessors by flipping the script and making defending the only way to attack. Submerge yourself in a world rich in lore, and be taken on a journey full of colourful and often comical storytelling, as you join the Princess of the Sea in a nostalgic quest to recover her mother’s lost crown, become queen, and restore peace in a world now ruled by fire.<br><br>As you leave the Water Kingdom behind to venture into the desert, you’ll meet witty and humorous NPCs, witness astonishing backdrops, and be carried by a soothing soundtrack! Will the Princess conquer her foolish foes OR succumb to the pressure and leave her hopes and dreams to dissipate along with the rest of the desert?<br><br><br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ<span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1678880/extras/727ceebfed29cf7398595e9d5563ddaa.poster.avif?t=1666714135\" width=384 height=216 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1678880/extras/727ceebfed29cf7398595e9d5563ddaa.webm?t=1666714135\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1678880/extras/727ceebfed29cf7398595e9d5563ddaa.mp4?t=1666714135\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>So you’re the girl who wants to cross the desert?</strong><br><br>Embark on the sea Princess’s journey to retrieve her mother’s lost crown by venturing far from the water and into the uncharted and dangerous realm of fire, a desert where the sun never sets, ruled by the sadistic Saladino and his seven deadly servants. The mission? Accomplish your mother’s last wish and set claim to the sea throne, so that tranquility can return to the kingdom and the moon can once again set a natural pace to the sea’s tide.  <br><br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ<span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1678880/extras/7d7e3533758014719c7253511a727ab1.poster.avif?t=1666714135\" width=384 height=216 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1678880/extras/7d7e3533758014719c7253511a727ab1.webm?t=1666714135\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1678880/extras/7d7e3533758014719c7253511a727ab1.mp4?t=1666714135\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Trust in the power of the Sea Ring.</strong><br><br>The twist? You will have no harpoons, tridents, or turtle shells of any colour. You must solely rely on the Sea Ring. The Sea Ring... is a ring… of the sea, and yes, it’s the title of our game! Passed on by generations, you can summon its defensive capabilities to briefly protect you from imminent danger. The best form of attack is to defend, and we push this famous sports philosophy to its limit! <br><br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ<span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1678880/extras/aa35d30bdb4a1e521925c02db833b5ab.poster.avif?t=1666714135\" width=384 height=216 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1678880/extras/aa35d30bdb4a1e521925c02db833b5ab.webm?t=1666714135\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1678880/extras/aa35d30bdb4a1e521925c02db833b5ab.mp4?t=1666714135\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Explore a rich world filled with art, music, humour and lore!</strong><br><br>Brace yourself for a journey through luscious landscapes and be propelled by an adventurous soundtrack, as you set off to vanquish those who stand in your way, starting with Saladino and his posse of good-for-nothing bandits.

Channel your inner pacifist as you use your Sea Ring to see off any enemy attacks, in true Sea Princess fashion. The Sea Ring can also be used to interact with objects, which will provide usefulness in situations outside of combat (hopefully).<br></li><li><strong>So about the NPCs… </strong>I guess you don’t have to talk to them but we encourage you to!  Some are a bit out there, others actually pretty funny (if you give them the chance to be), and some can be really helpful too, giving you well-needed tips as you explore the lore of this game. With over 50 of them, and 100s of unique dialogue, we’re sure they’ll help you get to your destination! Just don’t pay too much attention to the weird ones…<br></li><li><strong>Sea Princess Calls Home:</strong> <i>ring ring. ring ring. </i>It’s not everyday that a Sea Princess gets lost in the desert. Actually, this may be the very first time! Whether you may be lost, stuck on a puzzle, or just feeling a little homesick, all you have to do is press ‘C’! Dad and his charm are just an underwater video call away! <br></li><li><strong>Illustrious Artwork &amp; Soundtrack: </strong>Feast your eyes on this pixel piece of art, and enter a state of musical tranquility with over 10 unique songs from the soundtrack, as SeaRing brings an atmospheric feel that engulfs you in ways you have never experienced before (in other words, our game is really pretty and nice).</li></ul>",
