There is a card showcase on the front desk. Pick up the card and place it on the magic book below.<br>3. Each marble shows stages. After you finish arranging Cubians and magic power, pick up the marble you want and take a closer look at what's inside. If you pull it closer to your eyes, you will be sucked into the world of marble!<br><br><strong>Battle</strong><br>1. There are Cubians down below. Pick them up and put them on the table.<br>2. The miner on the left is working hard to collect red ore. You can pick up Cubians as many ore as indicated below.<br>3. Turn the controller upside down. Once, your palm facing up! Wow! A real magic book appears! With the other hand, pick up the magic card and place it above the book. After that once you face the table, you will see the area where you may use the magic, and if you release the card, you can cast a powerful magic!<br>(Never throw cards to the table!)<br><br><strong>Are you ready?
