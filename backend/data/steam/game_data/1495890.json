    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >  Pathfinder 2 RPG - Little Trouble in Big Absalom</h2>Always living in the shadows is hard when you're a clever and regal creature like a kobold. Now it's time to make a name for yourself and bring honor and prestige to your clan.<br>In<br><i>  Little Trouble in Big Absalom</i>  , you take on the role of one of five kobolds from the Hookclaw clan tasked with exploring a treasure-laden vault discovered by a team of Hookclaw diggers. Enticed by the potential wealth, the kobolds brave terrible dangers in what turns out to be a grandmother's basement before being asked by the kind old lady to retrieve her magical hedge trimmer from a neighbor's garden.<br><i>  Little Trouble in Big Absalom</i>  includes two mini adventures that can be played back to back or alone--filling as much or as little time as you have for madcap adventure.
