    "description": "The Amazing T.k's Suburban Nightmares<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInspired by the horror/slasher pop culture from the 80's, this multiplayer survival horror pits players against each other in suburban landscapes. Other players aren't the only danger. A serial killer and plenty of copycat psycopaths that he's inspired are still terrorizing victims. Players collect the souls of the enemies they kill or find; the person with the most at the end of the match wins. Each map accommodates four players locally and have AI characters with unique weapons and statistics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGAME STORY :   <br />\r\n <br />\r\nA decade after suburbia had its worst nightmares brought to life in the form of a string of missing persons cases, rapes, and murders, at the hands of the now infamous &quot;Suburban Slasher&quot;,  the nightmarish events are starting up again and with a higher body count due to a serial killer worshiping cult-like group on the rise calling themselves H.A.T.E (Humans.Are.Truly.Evil).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe protagonist - Delancey Dekker, survivor of the original Suburban Slasher killings and now private investigator, returns to her childhood suburban neighborhood with her close associate while on a new case that seems all too familiar.  Her goal : save as many lost souls as possible before they are claimed by evil.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote : A controller is required for local multi-player. Only one player can use the keyboard to play in a multi-player session.",
