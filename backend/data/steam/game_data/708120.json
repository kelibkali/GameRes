With our &quot;Parts&quot; system, even someone with zero drawing, 3D design, or any other formal training can make detailed miniatures for their gaming needs.<br><br>What are you waiting for, hundreds of parts are just waiting for you build the miniatures you have always wanted to! We have even had some early testers print out large parts and piece them together to make giant miniatures 3 feet tall.. the options are limitless!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >UPDATE: Fantasy Miniatures Update!</h2>- Our first major update adds a much anticipated Fantasy Miniatures build area. You can now create and 3D print fantasy hero miniatures!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/708120/extras/94c43070e2595d27bf6e81d434d7a8e1.avif?t=1576636616\" width=260 height=400 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> This software is designed to be used in part with a 3D Printer of any kind. However, it can be used on it's own. The file format exported by Printer Forge 3D are .STL files.<br></li><li> Printer Forge 3D's exported STL files are compatible with all 3D printers that support that industry standard STL format. The STL files do not dictate the quality your 3D Printer can print, this is solely dependent on your slicing software of choice and the many settings you control on your 3D printer. For optimal performance from your 3D printer please contact the manufacturer or make use of the many online resources available.<br></li><li> Options for a 'Commercial License' will be available after the Early Access phase. This will allow owners of this license to commercially utilize the miniatures they create in Printer Forge 3D, more information will be available closer to the end of the Early Access.</li></ul><br><i>Note: Some slicing software packages may require you to ensure the STL models are Manifold (water tight) before printing, however many solve that issue for you before printing.</i><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/708120/extras/299d52be63d3a556fb236c7446980914.avif?t=1576636616\" width=600 height=338 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/708120/extras/b485a1539b1c50304d2cd0d7942e927e.avif?t=1576636616\" width=600 height=338 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/708120/extras/c3cad8a663dfd21044fbdd9f7b57c7a7.avif?t=1576636616\" width=600 height=338 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Previews of some Miniatures created with Printer Forge 3D:</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/708120/extras/665e4bb78ffb30dc208f23c690fbca48.avif?t=1576636616\" width=400 height=222 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/708120/extras/6d47ba0e471e85248816a2a8f1c6938d.avif?t=1576636616\" width=400 height=222 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/708120/extras/aaea2791ccbcc0da24a4d5331e4b3184.avif?t=1576636616\" width=400 height=222 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/708120/extras/3fd5e74194ba92f8039a4b563c677e9a.avif?t=1576636616\" width=400 height=222 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/708120/extras/5438673fa0d20b538296b130674356fa.avif?t=1576636616\" width=400 height=222 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/708120/extras/d232950c56f2b18f976ba9facac4b2dc.avif?t=1576636616\" width=400 height=222 /></span>",
