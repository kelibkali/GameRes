Through tactical turn-based battles, these unlikely heroes face Bobbies, British Sailors gone bad, aggressive Posh Girls, and other Victorian-era archetypes stand in their way – not to mention the occasional menacing Mime or Robobear. The game’s innovative Devotion morale system affects characters’ performance not only in battles, but also for actual circus shows, dutifully managed between heroic jaunts through six sprawling districts.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1666250/extras/e61ba6947ce7fc637b826dfce691e086.poster.avif?t=1763577275\" width=600 height=160 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1666250/extras/e61ba6947ce7fc637b826dfce691e086.webm?t=1763577275\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1666250/extras/e61ba6947ce7fc637b826dfce691e086.mp4?t=1763577275\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features:</h2><br><strong>Electrifying RPG Combat </strong><br>Test the skills of Strongmen, Fire Blowers, Escape Artists, Clowns, and other classic circus performers – 15 playable archetypes total, each with deep tactical options in battle.
