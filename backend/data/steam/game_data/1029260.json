The game takes place in Lasfaria, a world with musical magic where the ancient founders created a powerful song called The Opus to store the rules of history, science, and nature. But now, a 77-Year War has damaged that song and reality is coming apart. Players will need to build a team of Unsung Heroes who will start at the the final battle and work their way back in time to save the world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Game features</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1029260/extras/63829838674e6dfef6caa32fc032ad59.avif?t=1609925237\" width=616 height=250 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Explore the magical world of Lasfaria with unique new races, distinctive locations, and years of lore.<br><br></li><li>Play 6 chapters in non-linear order alongside iconic story characters on both sides of a 77-year War. <br><br></li><li>Engage in 45+ diverse levels where none of them look or play the same way.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1029260/extras/d60e0e273ef9de27d979b510fe691de8.avif?t=1609925237\" width=616 height=250 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Cast spells through songs and musical abilities. <br><br></li><li>Coordinate your units to gain special bonuses with “Harmony Songbook” game play. <br><br></li><li>Listen to an all-new, musical score by world renown composer <strong>Hitoshi Sakimoto</strong>.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1029260/extras/6e953f9ec17fcefcbb1eab0fed3cfeaa.avif?t=1609925237\" width=616 height=250 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Customize your Unsung Heroes from 20 jobs and 150+ unique abilities.<br><br></li><li>Stylize their look from options such as race, face, hair, and job outfit colors.<br><br></li><li>Collect new options in side quests as the game progresses.</li></ul>",
