    "description": "Nova Blitz is a real-time, digital, card game set in a future universe ruled by five Aspects of energy: Arcane, Tech, Divine, Nature, and Chaos. As a Nova, you channel that energy to summon units, use powers, and knock out your opponent. <br><br>Summon units, play powers, and duel in real time. Turns are simultaneous, with both players playing at once, and in combat, hidden attack and block orders let you bluff and counter-bluff your opponent.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>DUEL</strong> in a Real-Time CCG<br></li><li><strong>BUILD</strong> the ultimate deck<br></li><li><strong>COLLECT</strong> more than 300 unique cards<br></li><li><strong>DRAFT</strong> a deck to win top prizes<br></li><li><strong>WIN</strong> global tournaments<br></li><li>Climb the Leaderboard up to <strong>NOVA RANK</strong></li></ul><br>Built from the ground up for quick games and constant player interaction, every match of Nova Blitz is a blend of strategy and action.
