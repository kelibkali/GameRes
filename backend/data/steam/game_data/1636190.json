    "description": "The Absorber is a first-person sci-fi exploration game. No blood. No guts. But, all the glory. Experience a basic gameplay experience that tests your patience to recollect minions that escaped during your crash landing. Roll around and absorb them knowing that each color unlocks abilities and will at last make you the ultimate absorber. To add to your frustration, larger minions will push back and complicate your absorbing goals. To escape the crash site, you will need to leave no minion behind and make your way deep inside the volcano. (Oh, and you will need to recharge your ship by picking up necessary batteries along the way.) Hang on for some rolling, ground pounding, and infuriating gameplay when you play The Absorber.",
