    "description": "<strong>A Catchy Game: IntraTag</strong> is a multiplayer first person-game stealth game, where players are divided into three tags (rock, paper and scissors) and try to catch each other in a randomly generated maze. You won't know who has which tag at first, but certain actions like running and catching someone will briefly expose it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Three intransitive tags</h2>Your aim is to catch some players, while others are looking for you. Each time you catch someone you get half their points. A round ends when the time is up, whoever has most points wins. Caught players do not leave the game, but simply change to the tag of their catcher.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What does intransitive mean?</h2>Intransitive means there is no single tag that's better than the others. Instead, each tag is trying to catch one of the others and can be caught themselves by the third one. This follows the same principle as rock, paper, scissors.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Hidden in plain sight</h2>Normally the colours are not visible though and everybody appears as neutral (white). Once you run, jump, touch another player or use a tag changer, your colour briefly becomes visible for everyone to see. The bar at the bottom shows whether you are revealed and if so for how long.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Three different game modes.<br></li><li>Seven different abilities that help you catch players or escape from your chasers.<br></li><li>Tag changers at the edge of the map, using them switches you to the tag that was trying to catch you.<br></li><li>Played in a randomly generated maze, so you'll never know what's around the next corner.</li></ul><br>Are you going to run around, to hunt down your enemies? Or are you going to stay hidden and ambush players? The choice is yours in <strong>A Catchy Game: IntraTag</strong>.<br><br><i><strong>A Catchy Game: IntraTag</strong> is the hobby project of a solo game developer and is made for fun, not money. The game is currently in public alpha (available to you for free by clicking the demo button) and doesn't include any in-game purchases.</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Playtests</h2>If you are interested in joining the playtest, you can find further information on the game's discord server:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Lore and background</h2>In a not too far future, humanity has started colonising the solar system. The third planet to have a permanent settlement was Mercury. Thanks to the eternal darkness, several polar craters have a moderate temperature year round, unlike the rest of the planet. Thus, they were ideal places to establish the first settlements. The possibilities for physical entertainment are rather limited in these bases, however one sport that developed there was intransitive tag - or intratag for short.",
