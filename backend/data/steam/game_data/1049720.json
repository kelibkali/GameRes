    "description": "Sqvishy is having a cheese-fueled nightmare, can you help poor puss parse fishtanks into oblivion? <br><br>Orginally designed as a virtual arcade machine minigame inside Big Robot's <i>&quot;The Light Keeps Us Safe&quot;</i>, this standalone version of Sqvishy is expanded and improved. Guide towering, tumbling fishtanks toward matching exit tiles in an increasingly frantic fever-dream of puss-based-puzzling.<br><br>Sqvishy is a fast-paced action/puzzle game of visualization, forward-planning and sharp reflexes. Giant fishtanks spawn at the edges of a randomly generated grid and begin to roll... By switching the directions of the grid tiles your puzzled-puss can guide these colorful cages to matching exit tiles. For every fishtank freed you score a point, but for each one lost - either through collision with another fishtank or by rolling onto an edge - a point is deducted. You must reach a certain number of points to clear a level. There are six levels - newly generated each time you play - with exits, fishtank colors and spawns randomized. Find a level of difficulty that suits you and get puzzling!<br><br><u>Features</u><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Six Levels of Difficulty </li><li>Customizable Colors </li><li>Full Controller Support </li><li>Customizable Controls </li><li>Cosmic Rainbows! </li></ul><br>Sqvishy will soon be appearing in original minigame form inside <i>&quot;The Light Keeps Us Safe&quot;</i>.<br>",
