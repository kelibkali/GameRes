    "description": "StickDodgeVR is a wave survival ball throwing shooter where you have to physically move to dodge and throw. It's dodge ball with a twist! Play until all of your 5 lives are gone and when you're in trouble, oh no! Throw grenades at the oncoming enemies as you watch them slowly shatter to their death. You can even save up coins thrown at you to buy amazing personalized skins for your balls! And watch out! The 20 foot tall giant adds an extra challenge by taking two hits to kill as it is trying to squash you with his giant ball!
