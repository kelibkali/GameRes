    "description": "Gemstone Defense is a single player tower defense game where players can construct mazes that enemies will have to navigate in order to reach key checkpoints before they can proceed to the next area. Each wave, players will place gems to form their maze and select one tower (gem) to keep. The remaining gems are converted to mazing rocks which enemies will have to navigate around. Players can upgrade gem quality, build special gems and discover the best mazes and secret towers. Can you make it to the end?",
