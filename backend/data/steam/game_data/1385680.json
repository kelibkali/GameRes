    "description": "Corpse Box Racers is a bizarre and silly local multiplayer party game where players compete as corpses in cardboard boxes to finish challenges and races against one another.<br><br>The game can be played in two different game modes.<br>Campaign mode (1-4 players) and Tournament mode (2-4 players)<br><br><strong>Tournament</strong><br>In this mode you and your friends compete against each other in a series of fast-paced challenges. Where at the end, the player who won the most challenges is crowned the winner.<br>These Challenges can be anything from throwing skee-ball with your corpse, getting the furthest up a hill while avoiding big bouncy balls, or racing through a race track to be the first at the finish line.<br>Tournament mode holds 96 levels, including the campaign levels.<br> <br><strong>Campaign</strong><br>The Campaign mode acts as a linear set of 48 levels where you try to race as fast as you can through increasingly difficult levels.",
