A being that could control time, the earth, the underworld, and anything else the human mind could perceive. There were stories of it creating tornadoes, raising demons from the earth, and stopping time altogether. This being was feared across the land, and worshipped by those who were too afraid to oppose it. They called it ‘Rek-Tu-Hiem’, ‘Requiem’ in modern terms.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428600/extras/a74e6678b0c36758c7a0708c138116fb.poster.avif?t=1684520544\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428600/extras/a74e6678b0c36758c7a0708c138116fb.webm?t=1684520544\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428600/extras/a74e6678b0c36758c7a0708c138116fb.mp4?t=1684520544\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>PREPARE FOR REQUIEM'S RETURN</strong><br>The kingdom of Redreach lived in a state of constant fear, subject to an endless cycle of suffering by this all-powerful being until, one day, it seemingly vanished without a trace. For years, Redreach's strongest minds attempted to gain some insight into where this being's immense power came from, and how it somehow disappeared from existence altogether. These studies led to the discovery of the Stormrites, a series of powerful scrolls that, in the wrong hands, could lead to the end times. You will learn about the Stormrites while navigating the mysterious kingdom of Redreach, meeting friends and foes along the way and creating your own story while, in turn, discovering your role in this world.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428600/extras/6dfc7cd76a88e56a3f75b781ef4d7d4f.poster.avif?t=1684520544\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428600/extras/6dfc7cd76a88e56a3f75b781ef4d7d4f.webm?t=1684520544\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428600/extras/6dfc7cd76a88e56a3f75b781ef4d7d4f.mp4?t=1684520544\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >HARNESS THE POWER OF THE FOCUS CRYSTALS</h2>Magic in Stormrite is intertwined with the mysterious ancient runic language of Redreach. Deciphering these runes and discovering their true meanings will lead to you as the player being one with the energy that surrounds you. Humans in Stormrite do not have any magical powers, and all power is granted by focus crystals. To cast spells, they must charge their energy via a crystal, with different crystals providing varying buffs and abilities to the character. Certain crystals are extremely hard to find, but in return will provide immense power.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428600/extras/bd617a09efa05fbc4dbdfeafaa2f5104.poster.avif?t=1684520544\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428600/extras/bd617a09efa05fbc4dbdfeafaa2f5104.webm?t=1684520544\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428600/extras/bd617a09efa05fbc4dbdfeafaa2f5104.mp4?t=1684520544\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >TRAVEL THE LAND AND DISCOVER THE SECRETS THAT LIE WITHIN</h2>Explore a vast open-world filled with interesting landmarks and civilisations, learning skills and trades along the way from the people you meet in your journey across Redreach.

Your time will be spent going on enthralling quests, exploring the kingdom of Redreach and using various weapons and fighting techniques to dispose of your enemies. The three main styles of fighting are melee, ranged and magic. However, within each of these three categories there are several choices of weapon/combat style for you to choose. For example, ranged players can choose to go for a traditional bow and arrow loadout, can choose to go for a more clunky but powerful crossbow style, or even a hybrid melee-ranged loadout utilising agility, daggers, and throwing knifes. <br><br>Magic users can choose to cast spells that directly affect their enemies, summon companions to fight, or manipulate the very fabric of the world around them. You are also able to shoot spells into each other, resulting in some very interesting interactions that can be used to increase your options in combat. <br>Melee users also have plenty of choices, with 5 fighting styles (and counting) to choose from, and abilities to aid with your battles.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428600/extras/e1d5cae24aded4cef5010f6f7118f046.poster.avif?t=1684520544\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428600/extras/e1d5cae24aded4cef5010f6f7118f046.webm?t=1684520544\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428600/extras/e1d5cae24aded4cef5010f6f7118f046.mp4?t=1684520544\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Stormrite will also have a companion system where you can bring allies on your travels to fight alongside you, either supporting you from behind or soaking up all the attention while you deal the damage from behind.
