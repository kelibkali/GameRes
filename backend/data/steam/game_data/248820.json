    "description": "Risk of Rain is an <strong>action platformer</strong> with <strong>roguelike elements</strong>. With <strong>permanent death</strong> as a primary feature, players will have to play their best to get as far as possible. Fight on a mysterious planet with <strong>randomly spawning enemies and bosses</strong>, either alone or with 3 friends in <strong>online co-op</strong>. With over <strong>100 items</strong> at your disposal, you will find the tools you need to find the teleporter back home. Discover a myriad of <strong>randomly chosen stages</strong>, from the desolate forest to the frozen tundra. <br><br>The three main goals for our game are simple: <br><br>     1. Design a game that is randomly generated every play-through, to keep replayability high and fresh. <br><br>     2. Time = difficulty. The higher the in-game time gets, the harder the difficulty gets. Keeping a sense of urgency keeps the game exciting! <br><br>     3. Be enjoyable, regardless of whether you win or lose. No more fussing with complex and non-intuitive gameplay patterns. Players should not blame the game for their loss!<br><br><i>''..joy comes from amassing items, gaining experience and watching your character evolve into a godly killing machine.''</i> - <strong>Joystiq</strong> <br><br><i>''This game is immaculate.
