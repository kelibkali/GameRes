The full game will be getting mod support soon whereas the demo will not.</i><br><br>Motocross: Chasing the Dream is a game being developed by riders, for riders. With an emphasis on the immense struggle and pure dedication to be successful in this sport, you will discover what it is actually like to be a competing amateur in American motocross as you blaze your own trail to the biggest amateur race of the year.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Our Mission</strong></h2>As real-life motocross racers and gamers, we have a high standard for authenticity and want to show the world how tough yet rewarding the sport we love so much really is. Eventually, we hope this game will change the current landscape of the motocross gaming genre and encourage not only ourselves, but other companies to implement core details of the sport into their games as well as ours. As we develop Motocross: Chasing the Dream, we won’t always get it right, but community feedback will be our main focus and drive to implement new features and changes to make this the most realistic motocross video game as a whole.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Current Features</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Ride a physically accurate 125cc 2-stroke dirtbike tuned for a realistic arcade experience<br></li><li>3 tracks to play<br>    <ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>Demo compound (multiple tracks in one map)<br>    </li><li>Canyon Trail MX<br>    </li><li>Playground (Multiple tracks, freeride areas, freestyle ramps, enduro track)<br>    </li></ul></li><li>Ragdoll crash physics<br></li><li>3 camera modes<br>    <ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>Follow camera<br>    </li><li>Slot camera<br>    </li><li>First-person camera<br>    </li></ul></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Upcoming Features</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Content</strong><br>    <ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>Tracks<br>    </li><li>Bikes<br>    </li><li>Customization options<br>        <ul class=\"bb_ul\">        <li>Bike customization<br>        </li><li>Rider customization<br>        </li></ul>    </li></ul></li><li><strong>Unique game features</strong><br>    <ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>Realistic arcade physics<br>    </li><li>Accurate ragdoll physics using real-world mass<br>    </li><li>Walk/run to your bike after a crash to pick it up off the ground<br>    </li><li>Multiple bike sizes - 50cc, 110cc, 85cc, 125cc, 250cc (4-stroke), 250cc (2-stroke), 450cc<br>    </li></ul></li><li><strong>Rich story mode</strong><br>    <ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>Realistic arcade physics<br>    </li><li>Start out as a kid on 50cc motorcycles and work your way up to the 250cc A-class as you get older and gain more experience<br>    </li><li>Take the full privateer path or, do well and gain factory support to outride your competitors<br>    </li></ul></li><li><strong>Multiplayer</strong><br>    <ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>Online racing lobbies<br>    </li><li>Custom server support for hosting your own events<br>    </li></ul></li><li><strong>Modding</strong><br>    <ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>Mod.io support<br>    </li><li>Custom bike skin support<br>    </li><li>Custom track support<br>    </li></ul></li></ul>",
