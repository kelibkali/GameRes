Presto will explore surreal worlds where he collects the lost magic of his circus troupe's past to restore the troupe to its former glory. Play casually at your own pace, or optimise your route, collecting everything, to earn the best rank possible at the end of each stage.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4312200/extras/33fbd1c21fb6c430fce00fe825ece769.poster.avif?t=1772138060\" width=780 height=438 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4312200/extras/33fbd1c21fb6c430fce00fe825ece769.webm?t=1772138060\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4312200/extras/33fbd1c21fb6c430fce00fe825ece769.mp4?t=1772138060\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A new adventure that can be experienced like the legendary classics of the past.
