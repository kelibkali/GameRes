    "description": "Early in development, Armada is a first person shooter that takes inspiration on naval warfare, allowing you to take your own boat into open waters and fight others  in a fast paced, closed arena. Later in development, players will be playing for points, which they can use to upgrade their boats and weapons mid game to try and gain the upper hand on their opponents. There are no teams, and it's every man for himself. Dodge cannons and boats as you sail across the waves in Armada.",
