The gods have tasked you with farming and, over time, inviting more people to join you in your settlement. Described as &quot;Minedew Valley&quot;, it takes inspiration from the two popular games, Minecraft and Stardew Valley.<br><br>Each new villager you invite to your settlement will bring something new, allowing you to unlock more items, trade with the outside world and form relationships!<br><br>But there is more to Sundermead than just your newly founded settlement. Below the ground lurks creatures beyond your imagination.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Procedurally Generated:</strong><br>Sundermead takes place on a procedurally generated 20km² island with varied biomes and tonnes to explore!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1649500/extras/207ebd39f80259b58f3c417e931afa3b.poster.avif?t=1719410991\" width=576 height=96 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1649500/extras/207ebd39f80259b58f3c417e931afa3b.webm?t=1719410991\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1649500/extras/207ebd39f80259b58f3c417e931afa3b.mp4?t=1719410991\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br></li><li><strong>Landscape terrain:</strong><br>Use your trusty tools to create the perfect landscape for your farm, although this can come at a cost.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1649500/extras/50d39e9af45056d4a1cbbbbfaccdec97.poster.avif?t=1719410991\" width=576 height=96 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1649500/extras/50d39e9af45056d4a1cbbbbfaccdec97.webm?t=1719410991\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1649500/extras/50d39e9af45056d4a1cbbbbfaccdec97.mp4?t=1719410991\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br></li><li><strong>Build a homestead:</strong><br>Use a near limitless combination of Sundermeads construction objects to build a home.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1649500/extras/a127eadb6396c0bcedb0246b53ecb0a6.poster.avif?t=1719410991\" width=576 height=96 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1649500/extras/a127eadb6396c0bcedb0246b53ecb0a6.webm?t=1719410991\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1649500/extras/a127eadb6396c0bcedb0246b53ecb0a6.mp4?t=1719410991\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br></li><li><strong>Farming:</strong><br>Use Sundermead's fertile soil to plant seasonal crops for your settlement.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1649500/extras/541df5633d0a92a376ab7cb3bfe1d644.poster.avif?t=1719410991\" width=576 height=96 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1649500/extras/541df5633d0a92a376ab7cb3bfe1d644.webm?t=1719410991\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1649500/extras/541df5633d0a92a376ab7cb3bfe1d644.mp4?t=1719410991\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br></li><li><strong>Settle down and build a community:</strong><br>Call villagers to trade with and live in Sundermead alongside you.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1649500/extras/ac6e4f50b6794bdd4c69d29e54148909.poster.avif?t=1719410991\" width=600 height=100 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1649500/extras/ac6e4f50b6794bdd4c69d29e54148909.webm?t=1719410991\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1649500/extras/ac6e4f50b6794bdd4c69d29e54148909.mp4?t=1719410991\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br></li><li><strong>Share your peaceful life with your friends:</strong><br>Sundermead can be played alone or with friends!</li></ul><br>Sundermead is being developed by a lone developer who goes by the alias of &quot;Josephus&quot;.
