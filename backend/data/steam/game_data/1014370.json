    "description": "<strong>It's a simple concept, get the DVD to the corner of the screen. The feeling of joy once you get it there is what makes this game so fun and addicting.</strong><br><br>Bouncing DVD: The Game is based on a bygone tech where you put silver circles into a plastic box and you could watch movies!<br>This system was brilliant and even more so of the discovery of a feature when the logo on the idle screen, would ... one in a blue moon, hit the corner of the screen. Thousands or flip phone recordings show the moment when this very event happens. Blah blah blah, that time is over ...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >UNTIL TODAY</h2>You probably know what we're talking about, the old-fashioned disk screensaver that NEVER comes in the corner!<br>Fortunately, a new era has arrived, an era in which this is all possible.<br><br>The player can control the direction of the disk using the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;D&quot; buttons.<br>Try to get the logo in the corner as quickly as possible and hit the top of the leaderboard!<br>Because of the limited controls it takes real skill and even a bit of luck.<br><br><strong>This game is a free to play time-waster. Enjoy it, loathe it and uninstall it. That's what we did!</strong>",
