Or are you a stelloliberal profiteer from A.R.K. exploiting machines for your own benefit? Embody a dynast in one of the five distinct factions with rich histories and backgrounds that you can help to deepen.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1393660/extras/12d88e7717f4db09558788bf847ce452.avif?t=1685644071\" width=616 height=204 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Manage your resources and develop your empire</h2><br>Develop and grow your empire by planning the infrastructure of your systems. Pack your citizens into huge hive cities or give them the luxury of residential archipelagos. Build industrial centers capable of arming the largest war fleets or expand your culture by building huge monoliths. Turn your systems into impregnable bastions as powerful as the legendary Chatur Arsenal.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1393660/extras/65bd616729eb0492a85fc736a2abf80f.poster.avif?t=1685644071\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1393660/extras/65bd616729eb0492a85fc736a2abf80f.webm?t=1685644071\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1393660/extras/65bd616729eb0492a85fc736a2abf80f.mp4?t=1685644071\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Acquire patents to get the best ships</h2><br>Patents open the door to future technologies. You can make industrially devastated planets habitable through climate control or make advances through exobiology. But the patents will first allow you to buy the best military devices. Invest in drone technology and build drone carriers, formidable against fighter and corvette squadrons. Be on the cutting edge of armor research and build cruisers from your shipyards.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1393660/extras/0377669ad233d29ac7c714dbfe46f531.poster.avif?t=1685644071\" width=600 height=268 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1393660/extras/0377669ad233d29ac7c714dbfe46f531.webm?t=1685644071\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1393660/extras/0377669ad233d29ac7c714dbfe46f531.mp4?t=1685644071\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Shape your empire</h2><br>Establish lexes that regulate the existence of your growing society. Will you allow combat drugs or will you prefer to use robots in your future wars? You can build a state within a state by allowing total surveillance of your citizens.
