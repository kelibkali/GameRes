About talking, dwelling, thinking. Walk around, speak to people, explore the town, uncover secrets (if that's your thing), and listen to Katie. Written during a time of immense personal transition, Katie is a casual yet vulnerable reflection on friendship, dealing with loss, and the pursuit of meaning in the midst of chaos. It's an expression of mind laid bare in a vicarious manner, and a narrative of a life on the verge of sanity.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A fully realized, living, 3D pixel-art town, cut off from the rest of society and ready for exploration.<br></li><li>Dozens of handmade citizens, each with their own look and Idea that they're willing to express.
