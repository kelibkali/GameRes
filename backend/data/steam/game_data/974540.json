    "description": "The Rune Founder's Soundtrack is a selection of tracks written and composed by Dean Valentine for the Rune game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDean Valentine is an accomplished composer from feature film and an award winning trailer composer. Rune is Dean's first video game score. Immediately recognizable and impossible to imitate, Dean is his own master and his strikingly unique, signature sound brings an extraordinary edge to his feature, game and trailer scores. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRune is a spiritual successor to the 2000 Rune Classic game also developed by Human Head Studios. Rune is an open world, action, adventure 3rd person melee game with elements of RPG and survival. Rune is known for it's brutal viking combat and Dean's soundtrack is equal to the task for this intense action game.",
