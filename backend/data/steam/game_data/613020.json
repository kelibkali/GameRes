It is up to you to choose right and wrong: Whether you ought to fight the Witch Sisters and collect Diamonds for the Fox King, or to break oath and help Ravanna restore peace to those worlds the Diamonds have been taken from.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Locomotion Disclaimer</h2>This game uses Sliding Locomotion.
