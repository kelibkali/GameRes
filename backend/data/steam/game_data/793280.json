    "description": "The government has won the cyber war. Their grasp chokes the citizens of every country as oppression rules the world. Then a group of hackers carved out an untraceable piece of the cyberspace and created the underground network known as Neon Valley. Since then, it has become a place where both the good and the bad coexist as the last of the free. And such places always attract a need for entertainment, thus the Neon Valley Colosseum was born.<br><br>An online shooter inspired by retrowave and neo-80s. Neon Valley takes an arcade-like route to the shooter genre. With high score leader boards based on both skill and style. Fast-paced combat akin to Quake and Unreal Tournament. Game modes such as floor is lava, obstacle courses and more. Neon Valley is a place where the best come to attain infamy and carve out their name in the cyberspace.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/793280/extras/7bda27cdb563ad16c9abe4fe5e83a8b7.poster.avif?t=1579362880\" width=652 height=366 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/793280/extras/7bda27cdb563ad16c9abe4fe5e83a8b7.webm?t=1579362880\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/793280/extras/7bda27cdb563ad16c9abe4fe5e83a8b7.mp4?t=1579362880\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>The new frontier Neon Valley.

On the surface, it thrives as an entertainment complex. As challenges for skill junkies. As a platform to notoriety. But the Colosseum fuels this virtual world. It draws in new challengers all over the world and with this comes opportunity. The black market programmers use it to test virtual weapons. Dealers barter and wager on the outcome of battles. Designers display their latest fashion code. Map editors design intricate battlegrounds. At the centre lies you. The user.
