Aside from the ghosts, spiders and other abominations patrolling the cave, there are numerous environmental hazards. The ground can collapse below your feet, lava can erupt and fill the whole room, or the room can simply fall into the void. At one point, you'll find an anti-gravity-tool which will help you float above obstacles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features: </h2><br>- run &amp; jump platforming <br>- you can save/load in each room <br>- leveleditor",
