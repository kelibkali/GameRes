    "description": "You Are a Camp Counselor taking care of 4 kids. You have to keep the children entertained by playing a guitar, if you aren't able to, one by one the kids will wander off never to return.<br />\r\nYou will also have to keep the fire lit, as the fire runs out of fuel the environment becomes darker and if the fire dies out you lose the game. To keep the fire going you can chop up logs and place them on top of the fire.<br />\r\nThere is a bear roaming around the camp. At times the bear will try and attack the camp and you will have to use a torch to fend it off. If the bear reaches you, you will lose the game.",
