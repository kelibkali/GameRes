    "description": "solo project, this is the first game i have ever made and is the result of teaching myself how to use a game engine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nthis is a simple 3d platform game set inside a fish tank.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n16 levels to play through <br />\r\nExplore the tank, avoid dangers, solve problems and jump around to find your way out. <br />\r\nPretty simple but surprisingly fun to play.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nthis game is no triple-A blockbuster, but i am hoping this simple game might inspire others to try and learn developing as well. <br />\r\nEven though it is technically fully released, i intend to continually improve on this game over time as i learn new things.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nthank you for your consideration :)",
