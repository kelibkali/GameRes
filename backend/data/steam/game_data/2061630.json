    "description": "(square) is a game where your only offense is as deadly to you as your enemies. With a lone square as your only projectile, you must eliminate your enemies by launching it around the arena. The closer you are, the more force you apply when you launch it. To help with this, you can recall the square back to yourself. But be careful not to let it hit you!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Over 45 level (takes a little over an hour to beat)<br />\r\n- Three distinct chapters <br />\r\n- Interesting and challenging gameplay<br />\r\n- An original soundtrack <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDesign and Development - Brennan Cottrell<br />\r\nSound and Music - Brett Boyd<br />\r\nTrailer - Chase Burden",
