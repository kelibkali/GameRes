    "description": "For those that wandered into the deep void of I Can't Escape and enjoyed the offset of moments it gave you, can now enjoy being engrossed in the sequel,  I Can't Escape: Darkness.  I Can’t Escape: Darkness, developed by Fancy Fish Games,  is an immersive atmospheric horror adventure game that invites the player to explore an unknown paradox full of conspiracies and danger.<br><br>My challenges for this album was not only to write better music than I did two years ago but to constantly fuel the inspiration I needed to make the immersion effective . New things that differ from the first album are voice manipulation techniques, live instruments, singing,  binaural mixing procedures, and non-linear music.<br><br>So many ideas went into making this soundtrack that instead of describing it more, I challenge you to play the game, try to escape and get lost in the darkness.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Tracks Included:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Enigmatic (00:22 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>Right of Passage 1st Floor - Faith (02:06 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>Corpses (00:19 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>Combat (01:16 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>Right of Passage 2nd Floor - Liminality (03:05 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>Ambiguity (00:16 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>Mushroom Grove (00:25 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>Discovery (02:54 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>Right of Passage 3rd Floor - Ritual (00:33 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>Right of Passage 3rd Floor - Unwelcomed (01:26 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>The Darkness Descends (03:56 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>Right of Passage 4th Floor - Nebulous (02:06 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>Tree of Peace (03:39 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>Right of Passage 5th Floor - Reaggregation (01:50 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>Heart Room (00:35 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>Right of Passage 5th Floor - Cognitive Claustrophobia (01:03 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>Traitor!
