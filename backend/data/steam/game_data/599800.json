    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>ORIGINAL GAMEPLAY</strong></h2>Using totally unique mechanics, Easy Magic will challenge you to learn new ways to play. Here is a list of the characteristics you must have to be a good player:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Good memory</strong></h2>After learning the combinations of spells you should use your memory to remember the combinations at the right time. This happens because every time you start over, the combinations will be different.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Fast</strong></h2>Do not let the enemies steal the powers from you, but if you've been slow do not worry, you'll still have a new chance trying to steal them back.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Strategist</strong></h2>First defend your base very well, in order to do this you can leave traps, dragons-bombs and knights. Afterwards, know the right moment to attack, as soon as you conquer a new base you will attract much attention.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Attentive</strong></h2>The level has several tips to get you on the right path, including how to kill the boss (who insists on appearing whenever you conquer a new base).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Adventurous</strong></h2>Nothing better than discovering all the secrets, because the rewards are huge, there's no way to get on Easy Magic without exploiting them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>NEW CONTENTS</strong></h2>We will be adding new levels, enemies, spells and other things on a recurring basis through updates (for free).<br><br>100% of the 3D assets and menu were purchased from Unreal Marketplace using the sales money from that same Marketplace.<br><br><br>If you want to know more about the new content or the development of Easy Magic, watch the Dream Real channel.",
