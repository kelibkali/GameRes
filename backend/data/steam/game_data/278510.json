Designed for the WonderSwan Color, Judgement Silversword has the unique distinction of being one of the few shooting games designed for a handheld console, and it's also one of the best!  Destroying enemies as quickly as possible is essential to scoring in Judgement Silversword, giving the game a ruthless tempo.  One of indie developer M-KAI's first games, it can be seen as the inspiration and predecessor to the gameplay ideas in Eschatos.<br><br>Cardinal Sins puts an interesting twist on shoot 'em up gameplay with a score trial marathon spanning 7 different areas, each with a unique objective themed around the 7 Deadly Sins.  Collect lives in Sloth, Hoard enemy data in Greed, and avoid Destruction at the hands of Wrath.  Mastering the different objectives gives the game a great sense of variety.  Getting an S rank in every trial is very challenging!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/278510/extras/afbbf1118e87fc76fdc03bea1c67d359.avif?t=1729542378\" width=620 height=306 /></span><br><br><strong>Key Features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Two different games!
