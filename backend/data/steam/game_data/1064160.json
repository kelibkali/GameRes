    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >We currently don't recommend the Vive Wands as input</h2><br><i>We temporarily removed the Vive wands as an officially supported input system as we don't feel that the current state of the locomotion system delivers a good enough experience. We still support the platform of course and improve it steadily with coming updates, but we currently can't recommend it as a good input device due to the limitations of the input controls (lack of thumbsticks).</i><br><br><strong>H.O.L.O.</strong> Humanoid. Operated. Living. Organism.<br><br><strong>HOLOCEPTION</strong> introduces a unique way to interact in VR. This game explores the extraordinary capabilities of the brain to project itself into another entity and still manages to feel fully immersed, <strong>but it will require some time to get used to the locomotion system and the controls</strong>. <br><br>Holoception is a Cartoonish physics based action combat arena fighter. Play in 3rd and 1st person. The hero mirrors your head and hand movements, so fight with style. Unlock weapons, double jump, attack in slow motion, grab the gravity gloves or squeeze the rubber ducky. It's all up to you.<br><br>Learn new ways to defeat your enemies the more you progress in levels.<br>Every time you play, the game feels different due to the physics-based combat! <br><br>“They threw John Wick, The Matrix and Hitman into a VR blender” <br>(Rendered Reality)<br><br>“Holoception has actually done something magical… This kind of innovation is exactly what VR needs!!” <br>(Stangerism)<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1064160/extras/14211d0b20c6b14d276034992f749313.poster.avif?t=1618330565\" width=616 height=354 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1064160/extras/14211d0b20c6b14d276034992f749313.webm?t=1618330565\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1064160/extras/14211d0b20c6b14d276034992f749313.mp4?t=1618330565\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Incarnation System:</strong> The player incarnates and controls a small character in front of him.
