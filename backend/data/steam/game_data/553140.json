But... Is he really alone? Shadows glide through the trees, watching him, strange whispers accompany his steps like a creepy leitmotiv, and something that has inhabited those woods for eons wants to make it clear that he is not welcomed there.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/553140/extras/13e29f7863f37843f9d434e9a374cf18.avif?t=1569526169\" width=711 height=169 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Atmospheric exploration</strong> - The forest that covers the natural reserve like a green mantle hides many secrets and dangers buried by the time, that's the reason why many of its zones have been declared closed to the public.
