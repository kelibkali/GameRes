    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\">Welcome to <strong>Operation Candy Land Demo</strong>. This demo is here to test one thing: is the core game fun, clear, and worth expanding into a full release? We’re planning a bigger game with more <strong>characters</strong>, <strong>turrets</strong>, <strong>upgrades</strong>, and <strong>build variety</strong>, but your feedback will help us prioritize what matters most. If you enjoy the demo, <strong>wishlisting</strong> the full game on <strong>Steam</strong> or <strong>PlayStation</strong>. It really helps support development. <br>And if you have any feedback, we’re always happy to hear it!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4308370/extras/c67b8c33ea224c933f14ff8f73098df9.avif?t=1772029366\" width=739 height=187 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >It may look cute, but this game is tough.
