    "description": "Up to 8 players must work together to find treasure in a world generated to challenge their specific abilities.<br><br>Each player can choose between the swordsman, archer, gadgeteer, witch, nurse, vampire, immortal, and bomber. You'll be challenged along the way to the treasures with puzzles tailored to these skills.<br><br>The rules of the game are pretty simple. Walk left, right, up, or down, or do the one thing your hero does. One hit kills you, but once dead you keep playing as a ghost. Ghosts can be healed by picking up a heart left by a dead monster, or by the Nurse, or by returning to the beginning. <br><br>One screen at a time is visible. When all players have left the screen, play moves on. Most screens contain a distinct puzzle.<br><br>With one player it's fun, and with multiple players it's a riot!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Meet the heroes</h2><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/923130/extras/2025ec3a298776a3bc63f989b3d78965.avif?t=1729084951\" width=72 height=120 /></span> <br><strong>The Swordsman</strong><br>He can swing a sword one tile's length ahead.
