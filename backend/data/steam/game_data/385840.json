    "description": "<i>&quot;Don't you remember me? After all we've been through...&quot;</i><br><br>What do you want to be when you grow up? Paul thought his life would be set after college, but at 22 he's toiling away in a job he doesn't like and coming home to an empty apartment every night. He doesn't know who he is, where he's going, or how he fits into his world.<br><br>But then on one dark and stormy night, a mysterious woman appears to him, and everything changes...<br><br>The Beard in the Mirror is a throwback to when adventure games came in giant cardboard boxes and if you didn't have the hintbook, that was it; you were stuck on that puzzle for the rest of your life. It's a labor of love from a husband-and-wife team from two different worlds (she’s a Sierra fangirl, and he’s a LucasArts diehard) who have been working on it together since before they even started dating. <br><br><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong> <ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>A classic point-and-click adventure for the modern age!<br>    </li><li>Sincere yet lighthearted story with magic, danger, romance, and adventure<br>    </li><li>Death lurking around every corner! (Although you'll never lose any progress.)<br>    </li><li>Retro points system to help you track your progress, and see if you've missed any secrets...<br>    </li><li>Just like the games you used to play on your dad's weird friend's computer</li></ul>",
