Bonus cards may help save the day by undoing the effects of the penalty or providing extra energy or score boosts.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Results</h2> <br>Who scored best? Who gained/lost the most? <br>Knowledge isn’t enough to win the game: get ready for surprises!<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1657910/extras/f0e6154342e8b2c772e839f1376a67c0.webp?t=1647873006\" width=206 height=56 /></span><br><br>There are two game modes:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Open play: you play with connected players.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Private play: you play with friends.</li></ul><br>And if you're alone, challenge our bots!

Each malus card costs you energy. Each time you use a malus card, your energy level will go down, and the worse the penalty, the higher the cost. You'll have to put in place some strategies concerning energy usage... so, to malus or not to malus, that's the question!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Bonus cards</h2>In each round, you can counter-attack with bonus cards.<br>There are three types of bonus cards:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Shields: these cancel out malus effects, allowing you to answer more easily.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Energy: these will either increase your energy level or decrease your opponents’ levels.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Points: these will add points to your final score or remove points from your opponents’ scores.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gifts</h2>Depending on how you played, you may be given gifts.
