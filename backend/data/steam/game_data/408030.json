    "description": "One of the longest running independent games on the Internet, UniBall has evolved from a simple version of space hockey into an online multiplayer e-sport that is uniquely its own. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe basics remain simple and easy to learn: you maneuver, you pass and you shoot in order to score goals. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut beyond this simple design lies a surprisingly complex game involving teamwork and individual skill that can take a lifetime to master.",
