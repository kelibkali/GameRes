    "description": "HandsON is a unique experience in virtual reality. Be amazed in this magical world of hands and dance and immerse yourself in this exclusive soundtrack that takes you to an interactive surreal world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe latest production by dance company Another Kind of Blue is a special experience in virtual reality. In keeping with the theme of this dance company from The Hague, HandsON also focuses on the relationship between people and technology. At first glance these seem like two extremes, but Another Kind of Blue merges these two seemingly contradictory elements into an innovative work that makes you think.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFascinated by the hand gestures of today's world leaders, choreographer David Middendorp has created &quot;hand choreographs&quot; that form the basis of this new VR title. In a swirling interplay of dancers and hands, a magical-comic world is created that exceeds your imagination. A world that you can view and experience and that is shaped by sculptures of hands.",
