    "description": "Engage in futuristic space dogfights against large warships and enemy starfighters. Manage Newtonian flight physics with flight assist and power settings, to outwit and eliminate hostiles, and survive through hazardous mine and asteroid fields. Enjoy gripping space flight combat across the 21 mission campaign and 2 wave-based leaderboard game modes.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1130880/extras/5435de2b5fe829faca48b54dd3022144.poster.avif?t=1762858186\" width=600 height=220 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1130880/extras/5435de2b5fe829faca48b54dd3022144.webm?t=1762858186\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1130880/extras/5435de2b5fe829faca48b54dd3022144.mp4?t=1762858186\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Absolute Territory uses simulated Newtonian Physics and applies thrust forces to allow velocity and rotation changes. A Flight Assist Computer makes minor thrust corrections to keep you flying in the direction faced. Making space flight feel more like flying a traditional aircraft, without any stall or any drag restrictions on turning no matter how fast you go.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1130880/extras/3d03c92f6e12763da1f3e98fc0d84a89.poster.avif?t=1762858186\" width=600 height=220 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1130880/extras/3d03c92f6e12763da1f3e98fc0d84a89.webm?t=1762858186\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1130880/extras/3d03c92f6e12763da1f3e98fc0d84a89.mp4?t=1762858186\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>A Slide feature allows the current velocity to be maintained while turning to another direction. Sliding is very useful for strafing runs on large warships or keeping fast-moving targets in your sights. This feature is still available for pilots attuned to traditional space dogfighting games.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1130880/extras/795d252927f0df0b4c7cc8e880b19b1a.poster.avif?t=1762858186\" width=600 height=220 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1130880/extras/795d252927f0df0b4c7cc8e880b19b1a.webm?t=1762858186\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1130880/extras/795d252927f0df0b4c7cc8e880b19b1a.mp4?t=1762858186\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Distribute power across engines, shields, and guns for an advantage over your opponent or get yourself out of sticky situations. Target and destroy warship turrets to soften them up before going in for a killing blow.<br><br>Disable the Flight Assist Computer to prevent any automated thrust corrections, leaving it in the hands of the pilot. Be warned, with no assist, speed restrictions no longer apply. You could theoretically accelerate forever. A reverse thrust toggle provides a true 6 Degrees of Freedom you would expect in a space environment.<br><br>To get the most out of your spacecraft, fly with a HOTAS/HOSAS (Hands On Throttle And Stick/Hands On Stick And Stick) controller. Combining with flight pedals provides accurate control for a more in-depth space dogfighting experience. If you use a traditional pad controller (Xbox/Playstation/Et al.), keeping the Flight Assist Computer enabled is best.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1130880/extras/17bd96a1a263b6bd9b9055cb4dedcc28.poster.avif?t=1762858186\" width=600 height=310 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1130880/extras/17bd96a1a263b6bd9b9055cb4dedcc28.webm?t=1762858186\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1130880/extras/17bd96a1a263b6bd9b9055cb4dedcc28.mp4?t=1762858186\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Choose your ship from fast-moving to heavy-hitting types.
