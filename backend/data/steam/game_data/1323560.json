In more ways than I can count, I was both looking to extract meaning from my circumstances and reassure myself that things could get better (yes, this was even before 2020 started). My best friend, Alaric Qin, helped me a lot during that difficult time. I would later ask him to compose the music, which (luckily for me and you) he accepted.<br><br>You know this began as a personal project but has grown organically over time. It eventually helped me enough to consider sharing it with the world, so I spent the last several months getting it up on Steam. And here it is! I hope someone out there finds tranquility, peace, excitement, purpose, or the motivation to continue persevering through playing this game. <br><br><strong>It isn't perfect, but then again, nothing ever is. It can get a little tough at times, but so can life.</strong><br><br>[h3]<i>Hang in there.<br>You're not alone.</i><br>[/h3]<br>Love,<br>Nick Oueijan",
