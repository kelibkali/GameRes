    "description": "Arkshot combines the fluidity and skill of an arena shooter with the lighthearted fun of a party game. It's Quake meets Duck Game. Unreal Tournament meets Smash Bros.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArmed with only a bow and arrow, challenge up to 3 of your friends on 14 unique maps, with 5 gamemodes to choose from. Grab powerups to gain an advantage over your opponents and become the master of the arc shot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon't forget to customize your character with unlockable masks, bows, and taunts to make yourself a foe your opponents will never forget.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Ballistically-modelled arrow physics that offer a unique challenge to the jaded palette of FPS gamers.<br />\r\n- Wildly differing level structures that are anything but your typical maze of brown corridors.<br />\r\n- A plethora of game-changing powerups, such as bouncing arrows, decoys, a reflective bubble shield, caffeinated coffee booster and pusher arrows.<br />\r\n- Latent tactics and emergent strategies that reward inventive players.<br />\r\n- A Stamina system where actions such as jumps, dashes and drawing back the bow all cost effort and require canny management.<br />\r\n- Sky Arrows that rain down on campers, denying them the option to skulk like wimps in hidey-holes.<br />\r\n- Hooded characters that have no feet and just float along, eerily.",
