    "description": "Its been 6 years since the fog rolled in, and with it brought a bunch of creatures that will tear you apart. Months after they came we realised that most of them are are blind and hunt by sound, so you will have to be very cautious when moving through towns and city's to not alert them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEquip your self with whatever you can find but remember if you fire a gun be prepared for the consequences. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDescending is a hardcore survival game in which you go around the large open world finding supplies to build shelter and keep your self alive, if you die you lose everything.",
