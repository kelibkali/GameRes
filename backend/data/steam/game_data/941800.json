    "description": "<strong>Construct PRO</strong> is a sandbox-designer, where you can assemble any structure using metal parts, bolts, and nuts and test its physical behavior.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Currently the game has the following features:</strong></h2>•\tassembly of a model using 29 parts<br>•\tSteam Workshop support<br>•\tsaving the model in a simple text file and further uploading the model from there<br>•\tenabling the gravity to check physical behavior of the assembled structure<br>•\tchanging the bolt properties (whether they are screwed on tightly or not) both in assembly of the model and with enabled gravity<br>•\tremoval of bolts/parts both at assembly of the model and with enabled gravity<br>•\tapplication of a special Boltogun, capable to destroy any model<br>•\tuse of electric motor for rotating the part  attached to it<br>•\ttest prototype with possibility to complete the game with it: you should assemble a model capable to overcome all obstacles and reach the finish line<br>•\tbugs (well, after all, it's an early access stage)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><i>Do the parts become available gradually?</i></h2>Currently there are 29 parts in the game and all of them are available from the very first minute.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><i>Can I complete the game?</i></h2>In my opinion, the sandbox games may have no completion; however, there is a goal in the Early Access version: to reach the finish line of the test prototype.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><i>I want to ride my assembled car across vast, endless areas!</i></h2>Do you really believe it's exciting? This is not a race; it's a puzzle for brainstorming, not senseless moving around the same locations. (at least at Early Access stage =))<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><i>Can I connect two electric motors?</i></h2>Um, it seems I forgot to fix it...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><i>Are there hats in the game?</i></h2>No. Who are you going to put them on? On a Boltogun? Then contact our developer and I'll add them =)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><i>Who turns the Boltogun wheel?</i></h2>Magnetic power of indie-developers.",
