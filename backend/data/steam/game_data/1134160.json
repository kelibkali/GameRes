    "description": "Please note that this DLC does not include any in-game content!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPizza for Devs is a continuation of our Coffee for Coding initiative, which was set up for our fans who wish to offer extra support in lieu of our free DLC policy or simply because we’re cool or something. After all, a well-fed dev is a happy dev and a happy dev makes more content…<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis DLC offers a collection of character artwork from Thea 2, which you can use for your RPG games, or any other non-commercial use. <br />\r\nIt will download straight into your Thea 2 The Shattering Folder.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo enjoy and thank you for your continuous support from all of us here at MuHa Games!",
