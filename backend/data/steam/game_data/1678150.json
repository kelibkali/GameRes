    "description": "World of Shooting lets you compete in realistic shooting sports matches, train tactically in ‘killhouses’, and collect your own armory from hundreds of historic and modern firearms!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCurrently, the game has over 120 firearms (up to 300 models total will be added), and 250+ accessories — scopes, red dot and laser sights, weapon lights, magazines, suppressors, ammunition, etc., all corresponding to real-life equipment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuild an ultimate Gucci racegun, shoot the heck out of a $5000 Korth, or compete with a 100-year old Chauchat — it’s entirely up to you!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSHOWROOM<br />\r\nHave you ever wanted to check out all the weapons in a game without completing the campaign or grinding for days? You’re in luck, because our Showroom lets you do that right away.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll of the game’s guns and accessories are neatly placed on its shelves. What’s more, you can try all of them out right away by instantly loading a timed shooting range for each weapon type.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPRACTICAL SHOOTING<br />\r\nThe practical shooting campaigns have over 400 levels called stages — each built using real-life rules. As you progress in each campaign, you unlock better guns and accessories of that type, and also tune and upgrade the weapons in your Armory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeat pistol, revolver, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle, and even machine gun campaigns — and then try the mixed stages, where you must quickly swap between your pistol, shotgun, and rifle in each stage. Campaigns include day and night stages, and feature dozens of different target types.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKILLHOUSE<br />\r\n‘Kill houses’ are sets of rooms with mechanical targets. used for realistic tactical training. They were invented by the British SAS in the 1940’s, and are used worldwide by special forces, military, and police. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCurrently, pistol, SMG, and assault rifle killhouse campaigns are available; shotgun scenarios will be added soon. Killhouse targets often take your firearm’s muzzle energy into consideration: decide if rate of fire, accuracy, or sheer power lets your clear that room the fastest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWORKSHOP<br />\r\nA powerful level editor lets you build your own shooting range challenges, using pre-made environments (including realistic urban maps). The editor lets you build your own courses of fire, program the stage behavior, automate moving targets and doors, and more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTest out your challenges and share them with the community via Steam Workshop! YouTube tutorials for the Workshop are available directly in the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQUIZ<br />\r\nEvery campaign has its own multiple-choice Quiz (over 150 questions available). You can use your knowledge of firearm history and technology to earn additional XP during a campaign. If you make a mistake, the game will provide a relevant Wikipedia link so you can brush up on your gun nut trivia!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGLOBAL LEADERBOARDS<br />\r\nEach game mode in World of Shooting keeps tabs of your results, entering them into personal bests, local, and global leaderboards that update in real time. Everything is taken into account: clean play with no misses, active reloads, using rare or old guns. You can see a diagram of your progress and filter the leaderboards by weapon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nENCYCLOPEDIA<br />\r\nFor each firearm model we add, we provide its basic history, specifications, and useful links. You can browse all the firearms in the game’s Catalog using categories, tags, and filters, and open Encyclopedia pages by clicking the book icon near the gun’s name.",
