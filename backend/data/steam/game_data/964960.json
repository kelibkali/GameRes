As the viewers watch, the streamer raids the locations and the viewers choose to aid in the defense. With cannons, spells, and teamwork, the viewers can fend off the streamer's attack. The more viewers that defend, the more loot the streamer gets from the raid!<br>​<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Each destination within the Plunder world holds new challenges and rewards.<br></li><li>Unique ships, skins, banners, and sails will be obtainable through procedural events.<br></li><li>Viewers abilities change per raid to fit the location.​​</li></ul>",
