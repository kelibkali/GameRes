You'll need to survive against hordes of skeletons and use your wits to escape with the most treasure. In between rounds, players can socialize and enjoy pirate-themed shenanigans.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >KEY FEATURES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>1-4 player online.

While some players may want to collect as much treasure as they can, as fast as they can, others may want to pirate their way through it by knocking coins out of their opponents in cutlass swinging sword fights, flintlock blasting gun battles, sneaky explosive blasts from powder kegs, and other devious tactics. Many of the combat mechanics are still under development and will be added throughout Early Access with player feedback taken in to mind.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567190/extras/4ddd8fc569e508e8b8bf913bace32ed3.avif?t=1728409431\" width=610 height=342 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567190/extras/5a40716f69fa3875619bf701c3ca624d.avif?t=1728409431\" width=610 height=342 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >MULTIPLAYER</h2>Shores of Plunder is all about having good old fashioned pirate themed fun whether you want to play solo or with your friends, family and colleagues. The online gameplay will be focused around an invite-only style of matchmaking so that players can enjoy a social online experience within a safe environment. Throughout Early Access new and improved lobby and matchmaking features will be added and adjusted with player feedback taken in to account.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >MORE PIRATES!</h2>As the game develops through Early Access there will eventually be are many pirates to choose from, including famous pirates from history. Each of these pirates will come with the ability to select a unique special skill that has a limited number of uses. <br><br><br>Designing your own custom tailored pirate will be a big part of Shores of Plunder and one of the biggest features that will be developed throughout Early Access is giving players the ability to customize everything from the hat they wear right down to whether or not they want to walk on a peg leg. Players will also be able to cash in the coins they earned to buy additional cosmetic items. The player customization and cosmetic store is currently unavailable but will be developed and adjusted throughout Early Access with player feedback taken in to account.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567190/extras/26e7359e996db2d682791a61be49248c.avif?t=1728409431\" width=610 height=244 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >I NEED SOME RUM!</h2>Pirates will do just about anything for a bottle of rum and once yours runs out of their special skill they will refuse to do it again until they've had some more rum. Replenish the skills by finding one of the many bottles of rum that are stashed around the island and drink it back. The player will have to take caution because while drinking rum refills the skills, it will also trigger a temporary drunkenness effect which renders the pirate vulnerable to attacks from any nearby players as they stumble around recklessly.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567190/extras/1ea7966bd9d72614e8dc7d45e9084324.poster.avif?t=1728409431\" width=640 height=280 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567190/extras/1ea7966bd9d72614e8dc7d45e9084324.webm?t=1728409431\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567190/extras/1ea7966bd9d72614e8dc7d45e9084324.mp4?t=1728409431\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >SOCIAL</h2>Between matches the pirates will be returned to the deck of ship where they can socialize, brawl and have fun.
