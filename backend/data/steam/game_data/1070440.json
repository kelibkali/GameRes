    "description": "Dark Miasma is a time management game with visual novel storytelling and a deck-building twist. You only have a limited amount of time before the town of Galeport is overrun by demons, and it's up to you to decide how to best spend your time in order to become as powerful as possible, while earning the trust of the townsfolk.<br><br>In Dark Miasma, you take on the role of a new town guard in the small, remote village of Galeport. After learning of a demonic plot to destroy the town, it is up to you to fulfill your duty as a town guard and protect the citizens of Galeport by leading them safely to the Capital. However, the road to the Capital is perilous, and the townsfolk may not believe you unless you befriend them first.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1070440/extras/6fa73b9c795574395f930270d5844077.avif?t=1575678132\" width=616 height=125 /></span><br><br>Demons aren't the only problem the people of Galeport face, however.
