    "description": "Pixel Fishies is a retro inspired game for 1-16 players . Lead a school of fish to eat food, grow, and destroy!<br><br>Up to 16 players may compete on a shared screen. Each player starts by choosing a school to lead. Choose different schools to compete against each other, or the same school for co-op play. Move your leader to guide fish in your school. School fish generally follow their leader, but may seek food or attack other schools depending on their personality:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Blue fish are the best hunters. The will seek food farther away than any other school.<br></li><li>Green fish are the fastest. They can also swim at a steep angle.<br></li><li>Yellow fish are friendly. They never attack other schools and stay close to the leader.<br></li><li>Red fish are aggressive toward other schools. They will seek food, but are most focused on eating other fish.</li></ul><br>When two fish of one color contact a single fish of another color, the two fish eat the other color. All but the yellow school will use this property to pair up and hunt.<br><br>Try to catch these power ups:<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/903560/extras/702b8486c48f2444a7d1892897b13003.webp?t=1548307499\" width=13 height=13 /></span> Size: your leader can eat other fish without a partner<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/903560/extras/b2c7743fe01564e33951dbd1d562d260.webp?t=1548307499\" width=13 height=13 /></span> Evade: no other schools can attack yours<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/903560/extras/80fd1b2dcc7b121d9df05c44ac6e6677.webp?t=1548307499\" width=13 height=13 /></span> Shield: protects from jellyfish stun or squid capture<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/903560/extras/6894b872c674b3a8ec6a9580af789d36.webp?t=1548307499\" width=13 height=13 /></span> Speed: all fish in your school move faster<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/903560/extras/cdb6bca4f2b91144662ba3c1d1a3d47e.webp?t=1548307499\" width=13 height=13 /></span> Add: +5 fish to your school<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/903560/extras/69e81ec8b649a44ac3ecb3533d59b8d1.webp?t=1548307499\" width=13 height=13 /></span> Add: +10 fish to your school<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/903560/extras/6d2cd92e1c6c0ac782eab04c875d52be.webp?t=1548307499\" width=13 height=13 /></span> Add: +20 fish to your school<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/903560/extras/0f76339740647b1e7bb041ebb60b4d2c.webp?t=1548307499\" width=13 height=13 /></span> Add +50 fish to your school<br><br>Some critters you may eat:<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/903560/extras/04f1339d6b91fc5d468751b0736abeff.webp?t=1548307499\" width=8 height=6 /></span> Plankton are the most common food source.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/903560/extras/f09aaed30ae2dad121d75cb95080bef1.webp?t=1548307499\" width=12 height=20 /></span> Jellyfish are a good source of food for fish that avoid their tentacles.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/903560/extras/083f51d3221c429888e06a10ff8790cf.webp?t=1548307499\" width=18 height=18 /></span> Starfish will release a substance which eliminates nearly all fish.<br><br>As your school eats, your food meter will fill up.
