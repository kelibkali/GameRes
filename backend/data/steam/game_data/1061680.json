    "description": "Join Angela as she's thrown into a surreal world, finding herself somehow transformed into a fox. Navigate through the outlandish puzzles and creatures to help get Angela back home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAngela's Odyssey is a point and click adventure game, played entirely with the mouse. It's up to the player to figure out how to interact with the objects and creatures around them in order to progress, but don't worry - there's a hint system for when you really get stuck.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is a homage to the old days of flash based adventure games, and as such, is entirely FREE for all to enjoy.",
