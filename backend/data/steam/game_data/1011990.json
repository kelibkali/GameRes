Now, the villainous Wilhelm Ehrenburg takes front and center stage, his night of bloodstained roses painting a crimson tale of action and despair. The setting of this gripping story? The final months of World War II.<br>Features the return of &quot;Dies irae ~Amantes amentes~&quot; writer Takashi Masada and artist G Yuusuke.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >＜STORY＞</h2><i>&quot;My mother was my sister.&quot;</i><br><br>Brooklyn, New York - The man who sat across the interviewer at the vampire bar known as the &quot;Borges House&quot; began his story with those odd words.<br>Following the end World War II, the pallid SS officer traversed the globe to many a raging battlefield, leaving carnage unforeseen in his wake.<br>The vampire of the battlefield. The wandering Hakenkreuz.<br>Though his saga was passed down as naught but a stale ghost story, it was no mere urban legend.<br>For he was Wilhelm Ehrenburg - hunted in absolute secrecy by the UN as a remnant of the Third Reich, enemy of the world, and one of the infamous members of the demonic Longinus Dreizehn Orden. <br><br>And after over half a century, the time had finally come for him to depart for Japan in order to fulfill his most ardent desire.<br>Humoring this interviewer he would have ignored or slain any other day was merely a whim birthed from the exaltation of the promised time drawing ever closer.<br><br>That was the only reason our intrepid interviewer found him in a talkative mood.<br><br>Thus, as he reflected on his life, Wilhelm grew nostalgic - sentimental, even - for the path he had walked. <br>And when asked, he unveiled his past piece by piece.<br><br>From the accursed blood that poisoned his very soul, to the blight wrought by the works of Mercury.<br>He spun a tale of the day he awakened to the truth of his being, and of the woman who had the nature of Wilhelm's existence engraved upon her very being.<br><br><i>&quot;Don't you worry, I'm gonna tell you everything. From the first moment I met her, to the very end of our story.&quot;</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >＜Game Features＞</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>All new side story in the universe of &quot;Dies irae ~Amantes amentes~&quot;, starring Wilhelm Ehrenburg.<br></li><li>Genre: Visual Novel<br></li><li>Staff: Scenario: Takashi Masada , Art: G Yuusuke<br></li><li>Play Time: Approximately 8 hours.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >＜Characters＞</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1011990/extras/40b3e0938fdb8b5e0be80dab1cabcde9.avif?t=1567762731\" width=600 height=538 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1011990/extras/5034ae3dd6da3455a87a2fee08399e51.avif?t=1567762731\" width=600 height=538 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1011990/extras/14457f85dd2bcc61248f6b9ca7a6ef01.avif?t=1567762731\" width=600 height=538 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1011990/extras/06fff862d82115fc3bc31cd6a21ba65c.avif?t=1567762731\" width=600 height=538 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1011990/extras/b98e7940d8d763827342c9e8b205dac3.avif?t=1567762731\" width=600 height=538 /></span>",
