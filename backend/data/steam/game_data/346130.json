    "description": "<strong>WARNING: Rktcr is very, very difficult (though only in a brutally fair way).</strong><br><br>Rktcr (from &quot;rocket car&quot;, pronounced /ɹktkɹ/) is a physics-based side-view action-platformer-turned-puzzle-platformer; that is, it's an action game meant to be played thoughtfully at much slower than real-time.<br><br>Rktcr is <i>tool-assisted-speed-run: the game</i>. Players can see the future and control the flow of time, allowing them to play frame-perfectly. Paths through levels can be easily shared, for boasting or collaboration.<br><br>Rktcr contains 37 challenge levels, ranging from easy to impossible; and 31 world levels, algorithmically arranged into 300 worlds of varying complexity. All told, there are more than 1600 paths to discover and optimize.<br><br>The Steam release of Rktcr adds Achievements, Trading Cards, and a smattering of graphical polish.",
