    "description": "Selenon Rising is a sci-fi noir, episodic mystery adventure game and visual novel. Buying the base game will give access to Episode 1, with further episodes to be released as DLC in the future.<br><br>The age of the Selenon has begun. When these mysterious, all-powerful beings arrived to take control of Earth, not even humanity's ultimate weapon, the Machina, could stop their onslaught. Now, they rule over humanity from the Moon's dark side, and the Bureau of Human Protection presides over the last vestiges of the human race. They have forced humankind to halt all technological progress, or face complete annihilation.<br><br>The Bureau's elite investigation force is SPECTRA, a team of agents deemed worthy to wield each of the psychic powers of the Selenon. Violet, a newly-minted agent with the rare ability to discern the exact emotions of suspects, has been partnered with Agent Blue for a new assignment - find the culprit of a murder. It seems clear-cut, but things are never that easy... especially when they involve the New Moon Resistance, a group of freedom fighters who want to stop the Selenon at any cost.<br><br>When their investigation leads to a web of secrets that may indicate humanity's ultimate fate, only Violet's emotion-reading powers will lead her to the truth.
