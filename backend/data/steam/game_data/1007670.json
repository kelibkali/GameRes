    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Meanders Map Pack: Cutmere Shard</h2>The Ice Terrains of the appropriately named Cutmere Shard lie to the Southern Lowlands of the Anorha Terra Mountain Range. Whilst slightly warmer than the vicious sub temperatures of the arctic region of Darthfellen the bitter climate is only slightly more bearable that its larger peer. This periodically accessible location wavers between hundreds of miles of jagged razor sharp ice and floating ice floes whereupon every Sumber season the Terrains melt back into the Bathys Ocean cutting off the Southern Trek and access to the Sunder Caves and Mawlands for months at a time. These Trackless Ice Wastes hold many secrets for those who dare navigate them, risking life and limb from bottomless chasms, violent unpredictable seas, razor-ice and bone-numbing cold.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>1 Crystal Bridge Blender from Forest to Ice Wastes<br></li><li>2 Rocky Ice to Ocean Blenders<br></li><li>1 Ice Bridge<br></li><li>1 Ice Fortress<br></li><li>1 Trapped Under Ice Castle<br></li><li>7 Assorted Ravines<br></li><li>2 Ice Cliff Ledges<br></li><li>3 Ice Cliffs<br></li><li>2 Ice Floe Extensions<br></li><li>3 Frozen Oceans<br></li><li>1 Cliff Ocean Overlook</li></ul>Maps are sized specially for FG at 1350x900 and under 500 kb each to help prevent slow-down during play.
