    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Dungeonlands: Palace of the Lich Queen</strong></h2><i>&quot;You guys did a great job providing a huge variety of scenes. Definitely the flavor of Planescape, or even the recursions of The Strange. And I for one would like to have my own time bathtub. The variety is great -- every encounter is different and interesting in its own right. No way for the PCs to get bored in this one!&quot;</i><br><strong>- Ray Vallese (Planescape, Numenara, The Strange)</strong><br><i>&quot;As the final part (3) in a series of epic proportions, the Lich Queen wrap up, which started with Tomb of the Lich Queen and continued with Machine of the Lich Queen, is set to be one of the greatest dungeons ever created and can go right along side anything from the newer generation of dungeons but can find itself compared even to some of the immortal TSR classics.&quot;</i><br><strong>- Geekline415</strong><br><i>The Lich Queen awaits in her palace.  Your heroes survived the Tomb of the Lich Queen, pushed through the Machine of the Lich Queen, and now must face the apocalyptic climax of the Dungeonlands Trilogy. Reality itself twists and roils all around.  Prove yourselve to the univers, take the final steps.</i><br>Become a god... or a corpse!<br>Inside you'll find all you need to run this unique setting, all the background information and encounters that will challenge any party of Demigod characters, plus the stats for all manner of new NPCs and critters.<br><i>Conversion by:</i> <strong>Jeannette Jarrar</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Savage Worlds ruleset.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Jeannette Jarrar</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
