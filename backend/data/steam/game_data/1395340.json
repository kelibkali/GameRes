    "description": "Armies Of Ganivar is a fast turn-based strategy game. Build up an army, strategically place units, and capture territory to overpower your opponent. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach game is played on a 20x20 board against a human opponent. Summon units from up to 3 Guardians of your choice, capture structures to gain resources, and cast a wide variety of spells to crush your opposition! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is based on an old strategy game from 2009, and is modernized and designed for core competitive game experience. Many elements that harm other multiplayer strategy games such as excessive RNG and pay to win will NOT be used in Armies Of Ganivar!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCompete against the best in a modern multiplayer ranked system. Who will be rank 1!",
