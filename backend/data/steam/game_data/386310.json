In this game you will face their immortal leader and his loyal four-handed servant which were summoned by the ancient sect.<br>This game has two endings, normal and secret (Cat Ending).<br><br>You are playing Ellen, a private detective, who is trying to survive in Eastern Europe. Lately detective business, which she inherited from her missing sister Sarah, almost ceased its existence and one day, before she was going to close her office, she got an anonymous call. The unknown asked her to find a hidden forest outpost and told her about its position. That was just the beginning.<br><br>You can access the game via &quot;steamapps/common/The Last Dogma&quot; folder on your hard drive. Simply launch &quot;Sacred_Line.exe&quot; executable file.<br><br><strong>Controls:</strong><br>W, A, S, D - Move<br>Space - Jump<br>Left Shift - Sprint<br>Left Mouse Button - Drag Objects / Read Notes (press again to close)<br>Flashlight - On/Off<br>Tab - Close message<br>Escape - Game Menu / Skip Cut-scene<br><br><strong>Physics Note</strong><br>Almost every object in the game is physically interactive. You can drag'n'drop things using Left Mouse Button, glass and walls are breakable.<br>For example, you can break the glass by nearby chair using your mouse (and you shouldn't forget about it).<br><br><strong>Region-locked</strong><br>The game is region-locked and won't launch if you live in CIS countries, South Africa and United Arab Emirates. The lock was supposed to be removed in the 1.4 update, but then the source code got lost. Which makes 1.3b the final and the only available version to this day.",
