    "description": "Play as Gregor, turned into a tiny bug, and set out on an extraordinary journey to unravel the mystery of your transformation. Metamorphosis is a first person adventure set in a surrealist world where your newfound abilities are your last and only hope for redemption.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs haunting and bizarre as the game itself, the game's soundtrack recreates the atmosphere of the expressionist era art and music in the early 20th century. Musical techniques of the era, such as Sprechgesang (half spoken, half sung), the twelve-tone technique, and aleatoric, tonal, and atonal harmonies invoke a past age that sets the stage for the world of Metamorphosis.",
