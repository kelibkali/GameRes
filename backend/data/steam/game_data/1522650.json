But deliveries from Steeltown have stopped cold, and all the Patriarch is getting from Abigail Markham—Steeltown's leader—are excuses. When he sends the Rangers to investigate, they find the place is a powder keg with the fuse already lit. The workers are striking, bandits raid with impunity, and nobody is allowed through the gates, not even on the business of the Patriarch. Without help, Steeltown could crash and burn for good, and take Markham with it—but maybe that's just what it needs. The Rangers will have to decide that for themselves.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1522650/extras/4df068a9360f76c29484cfcf6a49ba14.poster.avif?t=1660067326\" width=614 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1522650/extras/4df068a9360f76c29484cfcf6a49ba14.webm?t=1660067326\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1522650/extras/4df068a9360f76c29484cfcf6a49ba14.mp4?t=1660067326\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Traverse the Steeltown manufacturing complex alone or in co-op in this epic narrative expansion.
