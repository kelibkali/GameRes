    "description": "The strategy is our everything. In this tactical theater of figures you have to go on your heads. Move your figure to destroy all enemy figures on the level to pass to the next test. Your enemies are card figures that you can defeat by going over them from the back or side. This also applies to your character. The one who walks last, wins. At some levels, there are teleports that help to move the turn queue.",
