In this Epic Fantasy, you take the role of a mysterious child named Hira, who seeks the 22 Fated Bonds to learn the truth of his origins and save a loved one.<br><br><strong>The 0.1.1 Concept Demo on Steam is completely separate from the main game.</strong> It is a proof of concept and a vertical slice of the game's features such as the combat, exploration and growth aspects of the full game, particularly represented by the Bonds and the Ascension systems. The story and level design are independent of the full game's scope, but will still give you a glimpse into its overarching themes.",
