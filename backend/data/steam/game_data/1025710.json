    "description": "<i>Real Al’s Humanity Academy</i> combines wacky minigame action, a bizarre sense of humor, and the world’s most human robot to give you a VR party game unlike any other. In <i>Real Al</i>, you became a student of the titular Artificial Intelligence character as he teaches you everything you need to know about the human condition through a series of ten second minigames: you’ll rob houses, bounce eggs, meet puppets, and exorcise demons - just like a normal human! You can attempt to graduate from the Academy by entering the “Human Training Mode” or face off against your friends for a place on the “Human Leaderboard” in the unlockable “Endless Mode.” There’s never been a better time to learn how to be human. Enroll today!<br><br><i><strong>This game is built only for the HTC Vive and will not work well with any other VR headset.</strong></i>",
