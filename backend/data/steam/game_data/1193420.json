Each Faction has it's own Card Deck which you either play against your opponent's hand or use to gather resources from each US State. Each Card has a specific action when played such as controlling a resource or blocking another Faction in a state. By the end of the game, the Faction controlling the most US States wins the game. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1193420/extras/78d1bfc8e9a3ba31c6f809a429f9d8c7.webp?t=1737478926\" width=31 height=32 /></span>The Factions:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Celebrities - they gather their adoring fans.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Corporations - they turn everything into money.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Criminal - they steal from other Factions.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Ecologists - they want everyone to Go Green!</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Government - they try to impose control on other Factions.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Liberals - they want everyone to seek peace and love in the world.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Nationalionalists - they believe in the Star Spangled Banner and Uncle Sam</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Religious - they want the country to live by the word of God.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Socialists - they want the workers to own the means of production.</p></li></ul>",
