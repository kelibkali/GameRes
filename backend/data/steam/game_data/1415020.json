Look no further. BLOODY SERVICE is a dark, wild and unsettling love letter to 80’s slashers.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >STORY</h2><br>A board member of the exclusive <i>Hilltop Tennis Club</i> is the father of two conjoined twins—the mother died giving birth to them. Members from the Club hate the 16-year-old boys, but their father is too powerful, so they let them be. The twins love tennis; they play switching the racket from one hand to the other and they are quite good at it.<br><br>But when their father dies, things change fast. All his fortune goes to Sophia—a first cousin once removed—until the twins turn eighteen. Sophia hates them—she thinks they are some sort of God’s punishment—and they suffer a great deal. And on top of that, their membership from the <i>Hilltop Tennis Club</i> is revoked and they are publicly humiliated and openly bullied. <br><br>Some weeks later, the <i>Hilltop Tennis Club</i> organizes a party to celebrate 90 years since the opening and every member is there. Even though the conjoined twins aren’t invited, they decide to go to the party.<br><br><strong>In BLOODY SERVICE you are a catering waiter serving rich people in an exclusive and quite boring party. But when the conjoined twins arrive…</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1415020/extras/885b071bc05d0c7550ed992403377ae5.webp?t=1613098314\" width=600 height=50 /></span>",
