It features <strong>Z levels</strong> (ability to dig down to explore caverns and sewers) and the ability to manage <strong>multiple dozens of survivors</strong> in real-time. It also gives you the choice between playing as technology-minded humans, combat-focused mutants, or even a tribe of cannibals.<br><br>Your task is to manage a band of survivors and protect them against raiders, mutants, monsters, and other environmental threats. To do so, you'll have to build a base, discover new technologies, and scavenge for resources. As the game progresses, you'll send <strong>expeditions to explore a dynamic world map</strong> to find other survivors, repair resource production centers, deal with other factions, uncover hidden secrets, and retrieve lost technologies.<br><br>After The Collapse, on top of being a free-form base-building game with <strong>light 4X elements</strong>, also includes multiple scenarios and a very expansive <strong>Story Mode</strong> with an optional tutorial for newcomers. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/727570/extras/ceac05140fb2614866a53c66df47d652.webp?t=1747848787\" width=580 height=60 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Build a colony in procedurally generated environments featuring many biomes, weather patterns, multiple underground layers with resources, and dangerous foes.<br></li><li>Manage a population ranging from a few survivors to hundreds of them and defend them against bandits and other creatures with automated turrets, traps, and other defensive structures.<br></li><li>Multiple game modes, a full story mode, and several scenarios with specific challenges, goals, and quests.<br></li><li>Launch expeditions to find more survivors, loot, and technologies in a dynamic world map where other factions are competing for control of the various resource production centers.

They rely on map exploration and scavenging to find and use the more powerful weapons.<br></li><li>The nasty <strong>cannibals</strong> who have no issue converting bandits and other hostiles into food, but who have forgotten their pre-war skills.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/727570/extras/a02d9e9d327a55ea681fc4efac65af3f.webp?t=1747848787\" width=580 height=60 /></span><br><br>As the game progresses, the world around you will change. Plants will grow, wither and die. Weather will change, impacting your crops. Creatures will start roaming the countryside and may enter your base when you don't expect it.
