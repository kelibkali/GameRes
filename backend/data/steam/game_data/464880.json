Discover the science of planetary terraforming, upgrade your infantry battalions to battle mechs, and grow your fleet from a squadron of destroyers to an armada of planet-destroying Dread Stars.  </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Varied Factions:</strong> <br>7 Playable factions comprising six alien races. Each faction has different research strengths and technology options. Forming alliances, conquering neighboring species, or discovering ancient artifacts may open up additional avenues of research. Choose your race wisely as it impacts which worlds will suit you, what trades or alliances may be offered, and whether or not your neighbors are inclined to trust you.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Stylized Setting:</strong><br>A distinctive comic-book art style and an original, detailed universe backstory draw you into an immersive game world. Interact with a unique cast of alien characters, make friends and influence people, or crush your enemies and see them driven before you.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Focused High-Level Strategy:</strong><br>Build a vast and varied empire, taking advantage of the unique traits offered by different alien populations and the worlds they inhabit.

Counter your enemy’s missile barrage using point defense or interceptors, then close to energy weapon range!  <i>Stars in Shadow</i>’s tactical engine includes several features rarely seen in turn based games. Multi-ship commands keep even large fleet battles fast-paced, and smart unit behaviors allow tight control with minimal micromanagement. Auto-resolve battles that are a foregone conclusion, while retaining the ability to replay any engagement to see exactly what happened.</p></li></ul>",
