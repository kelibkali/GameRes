While the gold could easily be taken from the mine to the nearest town each day, scavengers, thieves and bandits in the area are relentless and the only safe place the miners have left is inside the mine itself, due to the fact that everyone knows about the Tommyknockers and NO ONE dares mess with the evil and dangerous creatures. This is where YOU come in: with very limited supplies, do you dare keep the gold safe overnight from these terrifying Tommyknockers, inside the very mine where they dwell? Can you succeed where all others have not only failed, but died horribly?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/794640/extras/42007bbc15d0ae97dfe7fde8e90710cb.avif?t=1741195675\" width=706 height=278 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Defend the gold and yourself throughout the night from the Tommyknockers in a haunted Colorado mine!<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/794640/extras/0ad9ae2d14c4ea9d02b1a41b298842b1.poster.avif?t=1741195675\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/794640/extras/0ad9ae2d14c4ea9d02b1a41b298842b1.webm?t=1741195675\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/794640/extras/0ad9ae2d14c4ea9d02b1a41b298842b1.mp4?t=1741195675\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br></li><li> Setup a defensive perimeter with bear traps<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/794640/extras/47c7225727419708f7da83e64efdf99d.poster.avif?t=1741195675\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/794640/extras/47c7225727419708f7da83e64efdf99d.webm?t=1741195675\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/794640/extras/47c7225727419708f7da83e64efdf99d.mp4?t=1741195675\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br></li><li>Throw rocks to scare away, injure and hopefully kill the Tommyknockers or at least keep them at a safe distance<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/794640/extras/98a7bc931c164f3fcbb02cd0a9a0fa40.poster.avif?t=1741195675\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/794640/extras/98a7bc931c164f3fcbb02cd0a9a0fa40.webm?t=1741195675\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/794640/extras/98a7bc931c164f3fcbb02cd0a9a0fa40.mp4?t=1741195675\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br></li><li>Use a candle-burning lantern to illuminate the pitch black darkness and scare away the Tommyknockers, but beware, candles and matches are extremely limited each night!
