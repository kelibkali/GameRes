    "description": "如果已失去的人能重见，哪怕只有一天…我将会做些什么？   <br><br>“你好，我是故事的主角<strong>小圆</strong>，我与<strong>小方</strong>成为了好友。虽然我们之间存在着很多的小矛盾，但是没关系，每次都能按照我喜欢的方式解决。<br>可是亲爱的小方，当我失去了你之后，才意识到原来我忽略了你的感受，原来还能有另一种解决的方式...<br>原来输了也能是胜利,<br>原来友谊的天平需要平衡…<br>一定能有不同的结局，让我弥补所有，好吗?”<br><br>这是一个商业化之外的<strong>独立艺术游戏</strong>，由作者一人独立完成。<br><br>游戏囊括了<strong>多种2D经典玩法</strong>，如射击、闯关、坦克大战、解谜等。上手容易，画面精致。玩家的目的是<strong>满分通过关卡，然后解锁一个反转的剧情</strong>。<br><br>所得的收入将用于下一个作品的创作。<br><br>让我们一起怀念曾经的小伙伴吧！<br><br>感谢我们的相遇。<br><br><br>If I could have you back again, for even just one more day, what would I do?<br><br>‘Hi, my name is Moonface, and Squareface was my best friend. We had squabbles and fights, yet we were still together.<br><br>But since he was gone,<strong> I realized that there must be other ways to solve the problems </strong>existed between us. <br><br>I found that losing the game is not that bad, if he was winning...<br><br><strong>I wish that the balance of friendship was always in balance...</strong>’<br><br><br>This is an independent artistic game, all the incomes will be used for the creation of my next work. Thx for your support!<br><br>The game included a variety of classic 2D playing technics，such as shooting, jumping, tank war, puzzle solving, etc. With delicate drawings, a reversal plot appears if the player full scored the beginning levels.<br><br>Thank you for listening to my story.",
