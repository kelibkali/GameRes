    "description": "The Hs 129 was designed to be a general purpose armored ground attack plane, but during the second part of the war it became the main anti-tank aircraft flown by the Luftwaffe. Armed with powerful weapons, the ‘Duck’ as it was called first appeared in May 1942 in the southern sector of the Soviet-German front. It saw action at the battles of Stalingrad, Kuban and Kursk salient and was also used in North Africa. Anti-tank squadrons equipped with these aircraft were sent to the frontline where the enemy threat was the greatest. Having many unique features, the Hs 129 B-2 was armed with a wide assortment of weapons including the 30mm MK 101 and MK 103 cannons.<br><br>In addition to Quick Mission Builder and Multiplayer modes, you can fly it in Career mode during <strong>Battle of Stalingrad</strong> and <strong>Battle of Kuban</strong> timeframes.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/894690/extras/cbad0c4b53410be9a64a49b9b8b1dcc6.avif?t=1734535216\" width=424 height=212 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Default armament: two 7.92mm machine guns &quot;MG 17&quot;, 1000 rounds, 1200 rounds per minute and two 20mm guns &quot;MG 151/15&quot;, 250 rounds, 700 rounds per minute.<br></li><li>Bombs: Up to six 55 kg general purpose bombs &quot;SC 50&quot; or one 249 kg general purpose bomb &quot;SC 250&quot;.<br></li><li>Length: 9.7 m<br></li><li>Wingspan: 14.2 m<br></li><li>Wing surface: 28.9 m^2</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Modifications</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Two 20mm guns &quot;MG 151/20&quot;, 250 rounds, 700 rounds per minute (14 kg weight increase, minor speed loss)<br></li><li>Four 7.92mm machine gun &quot;MG 17&quot;, 1000 rounds total, 1200 rounds per minute (195 kg weight increase, minor speed loss)<br></li><li>30mm gun &quot;MK 101&quot;, 30 rounds, 250 rounds per minute (179 kg weight increase, 6 kph speed loss)<br></li><li>30mm gun &quot;MK 103&quot;, 80 rounds, 400 rounds per minute (234 kg weight increase, 6 kph speed loss)<br></li><li>Fixed loop radio compass Peilrahmen PR 16 (10 kg weight increase, minor speed loss)<br></li><li>Rearview mirror (1 kg weight increase, 1 kph speed loss)</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Skins</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Standard pattern.<br></li><li>Standard pattern with winter camo, Stalingrad, January 1943.<br></li><li>Hptm.
