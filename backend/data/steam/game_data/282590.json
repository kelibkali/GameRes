    "description": "Star Ruler 2 is a massive scale 4X/RTS set in space. Explore dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of systems in a galaxy of your choosing, expand across its planets, exploit the resources you find, and ultimately exterminate any who stand in your way. The fate of your empire depends on your ability to master the economy, field a military, influence galactic politics, and learn what you can about the universe.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Galactic Economy</h2>Colonize planets, each with one of dozens of resources, working in unison to create bustling centers of production. The resources you choose matter, and will guide your empire and its conflicts throughout the entire game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Custom Ships</h2>Design ships that fit your needs, strategies, and tactics using our new 'blueprint painting' approach to ship design. Quickly and intuitively lay out the armor, weapons, engines, and internals of your vessels.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Politics with Power</h2>Diplomacy and influence gathering are reinvented as a core mechanic of the game, giving meaningful alternative options to players and serving as a platform of interaction both between players and AIs as well as humans in multiplayer. Harness your influence to annex territory, spy on enemies, aid allies, and more! You truly have the opportunity to affect the political landscape.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Massive Scale</h2>Running on our internally developed Starflare Engine, Star Ruler 2 is able to make full use of multi-core cpus, and runs on both 32 bit and 64 bit machines. The size of a galaxy is only limited by your hardware and ambitions!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Intricate Research</h2>Expand your knowledge through a grid of numerous technologies, big and small. Improve nearly every aspect of your empire.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Complete Moddability</h2>You can modify the gameplay, graphics, interface, and virtually every other facet of the game through scripts and data files, giving unprecedented freedom to the modding community to implement any feature they want. Use the in-game mod editor to add or change most content, and upload your mod to the Steam Workshop!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Full Multiplayer</h2>Star Ruler 2 features complete multiplayer support with up to 28 players and AIs in the same game.<br><br><i>Games above 8 players or in galaxies of several hundred systems may exceed the capacity of a typical home connection. Consider playing very large games on LAN.</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Cross-Platform Support</h2>Star Ruler 2 supports both Windows and Linux, with all game features supported fully on and between both operating systems.",
