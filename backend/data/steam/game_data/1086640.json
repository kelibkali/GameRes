    "description": "<strong>Dude Simulator 3</strong> is an open world sandbox game. It is your friend’s birthday tomorrow. You have already bought him a present, now you only have to give it to him. But your friends lives in another city, quite far from you. So you are going to make a long trip, and there are lots of adventures waiting for you on your way there: you will have to earn money, communicate with some people, escape from prison, etc. Apart from the plot mode, in this game you can also explore various cities, find money and spend it on different things, ride cars, enter any buildings, buy something, make jokes on people around you, and so on. In general, you can do whatever can be done in real life.",
