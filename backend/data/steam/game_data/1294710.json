    "description": "Intern Pursuit Game is a third-person tower defense game, where you are an Intern on your first day.  Suddenly a portal opens to another planet, and you have a space suit and super powers, powered by an ancient alien space rune.  Prepare yourself as you are about to face alien forces, come to take away your new power!  Use turrets and a side arm, along with your new powers to repel these enemies... so you can get back to work on earth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this demo we provide you with 2 of the planets we have created so far.  This is a game play demo so we are focusing on that aspect, but we are still early in development, so game systems may vary from the final product.",
