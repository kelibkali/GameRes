    "description": "C.Q.C. - Close Quarters Combat is a fun and action-packed top-down shooter experience, which you can play together with up to four players in a local split-screen match. It provides a variety of maps divided into various settings, where each setting has its own Co-Op and PvP map/s. In each map, you are able to choose your player from eight different unique characters and equip them from a selection of six different guns, which you are able to upgrade after each Co-Op mission. C.Q.C. has a full controller support and can also be played with keyboard and mouse.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Play with Your Friends in Co-Op</h2><strong>Connect up to four controllers, call your friends and let the zombie-hunting party begin: The Co-Op mode is here!</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/981250/extras/b5a582de7253785d8ae393c0e3872419.poster.avif?t=1645558389\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/981250/extras/b5a582de7253785d8ae393c0e3872419.webm?t=1645558389\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/981250/extras/b5a582de7253785d8ae393c0e3872419.mp4?t=1645558389\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Make your way together with three friends in six different Co-Op scenarios.
