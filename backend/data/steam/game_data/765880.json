    "description": "Your role is to uncover evidence as a journalist by sneaking through restricted areas and questioning people on their actions through a series of one-on-one interviews. All this takes place in a detailed, systems-driven world where people will react to your actions and where time is your biggest enemy.<br><br>At White Paper Games, we focus on world’s that feel lived in through non-linear spaces and objectives that can be solved with multiple approaches. We love games with a strong narrative drive that tackle important social issues and aim to set that standard within our own work. <br><br>We understand not everyone plays for the deeper narrative experience, and for those that like the idea of trespassing, breaking into secure locations and hacking 4 digit codes, we have plenty of rule breaking opportunities to take advantage of in the world of The Occupation<br><br>Instead of creating a feature list, we wanted to highlight the cool work our team of 9 have created over the past 4 years of development.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765880/extras/3faab86fb88aedb5f7e91c5f51f9eebf.poster.avif?t=1725434755\" width=600 height=154 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765880/extras/3faab86fb88aedb5f7e91c5f51f9eebf.webm?t=1725434755\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765880/extras/3faab86fb88aedb5f7e91c5f51f9eebf.mp4?t=1725434755\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Time is a precious resource to us all. Every minute in the game is a real-world minute and The Occupation is played over a fixed time length so make sure your actions count. Your watch can be used to set alarms and timers to help keep track of important objectives such as time delayed safes so you don’t have to hang around whilst security is searching for you somewhere you shouldn't be.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765880/extras/3ed00bdd72efc86c9aa590f9533adfa1.poster.avif?t=1725434755\" width=600 height=154 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765880/extras/3ed00bdd72efc86c9aa590f9533adfa1.webm?t=1725434755\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765880/extras/3ed00bdd72efc86c9aa590f9533adfa1.mp4?t=1725434755\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Wherever you live, the chances are you’re in a country that could be run a little better, where trust may be feeling a little low. You may not care how their decisions impact you and you instead continue with your daily life ignoring the distracting scaremongering. Or, you may be actively involved in trying to create true change. We love that, in most countries, people have a choice in this, and that’s how we wanted to approach The Occupation’s gameplay design. The world is open for you to explore and it’s up to you what threads you find interesting and wish to follow in the world. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765880/extras/0beb12abc9e60ced36d612b1c55e5525.poster.avif?t=1725434755\" width=600 height=154 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765880/extras/0beb12abc9e60ced36d612b1c55e5525.webm?t=1725434755\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765880/extras/0beb12abc9e60ced36d612b1c55e5525.mp4?t=1725434755\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Daniel Hillben and Steven Crow are the security guards employed by The Bowman Carson Group and will be around to monitor your activity to make sure you’re not doing anything you shouldn’t be. Daniel Hillben has been with the Bowman Carson Group for many years so try not to get on the wrong side of him. You may have seen the acting work of Steven Crow in advertisements such as ‘Warts Away’ or ‘The Restorer’; Steve is working this security gig to pay the bills but his real aspirations lay in Hollywood. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765880/extras/87c692d5cf17b36c77b9ad21f48b5c70.poster.avif?t=1725434755\" width=600 height=154 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765880/extras/87c692d5cf17b36c77b9ad21f48b5c70.webm?t=1725434755\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765880/extras/87c692d5cf17b36c77b9ad21f48b5c70.mp4?t=1725434755\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Whether you chose to break into a office through the window, find an ID card or pull the power to the room, we designed the world to accommodate your choice, approach and need to interact with objects you may or may not need for your research. <br><br>Sincerely, if you read this far and enjoy the work we create, thank you.
