    "description": "<i>Red Trigger 2</i> is an FPA (First Person Adventure) game, inspired by games like <i>Portal</i>, <i>Metroid Prime</i>, <i>Bioshock</i>, <i>Psychonauts</i> and more, but very much has its own identity.<br><br>In <i>Red Trigger 2</i>, the main mechanic revolves around you shooting red blocks called Red Triggers.

You can either retract Red Triggers one at a time, or all at once. Be careful though, you don't want to do that while standing on an extended block over a deep, deep void below you!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1610850/extras/b645f2ef144d40b1c1c8b563512aa281.poster.avif?t=1699410249\" width=612 height=240 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1610850/extras/b645f2ef144d40b1c1c8b563512aa281.webm?t=1699410249\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1610850/extras/b645f2ef144d40b1c1c8b563512aa281.mp4?t=1699410249\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>The Red Triggers are used in many different ways like making platforms, blocking lasers, holding doors open, powering systems, conducting electricity, propelling yourself, inputting codes and more! <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1610850/extras/90ee9003b1ad98f5f5b990a2e4cc3d72.poster.avif?t=1699410249\" width=600 height=234 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1610850/extras/90ee9003b1ad98f5f5b990a2e4cc3d72.webm?t=1699410249\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1610850/extras/90ee9003b1ad98f5f5b990a2e4cc3d72.mp4?t=1699410249\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>As you enter the HUB of the game, you can tackle the biomes all around it in almost any order you want.

Uncover the dark truth of this universe through the events of the game, but also through <i>Bioshock</i>-esque audio logs. Piece all those elements together to discover the secrets of this abstract world inside a digital server. All the characters are fully voice-acted and are full of personality. <br><br><i>Red Trigger 2</i> is about 10 times bigger than <i>Red Trigger</i>.<br><br>To keep updated on all our news, follow us on social media on Facebook or Twitter!
