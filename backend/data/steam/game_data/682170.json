    "description": "<strong><i>Selected for PAX Rising at PAX South 2018 and &quot;Best Let's Play!&quot; category at DreamHack Austin 2018!</i></strong><br><br>&quot;You are being stalked by evil dolls in an old black-and-white film...&quot;<br><br>Witchkin is a first-person 'hide-and-sneak' survival horror game in the vein of Slender or Five Nights at Freddie's. <br><br>The player takes the role of a child attempting to find his abducted little sister in an abandoned Texas farmhouse in the 1920s. This house is home to the Witchkin--a family of terrifying toys, the children of a deranged woman known as the Candy Lady. Using her “children” she will do everything in her power to keep all who enter the house from ever leaving.<br><br>The base play mechanics of Witchkin are primarily stealth. Sneaking, hiding, staying quiet and aware of the toys and your surroundings are skills required throughout the game. Witchkin boasts a very strong and unique art style reminiscent of early silent movies, painted in the eerie sepia tones of postmortem photos and the murky shadows of nightmares.<br><br>Witchkin is a one-man show, only one person created the game: art, music, voice (with a little help from family members), and programming.",
