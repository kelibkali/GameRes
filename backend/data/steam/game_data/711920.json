Someone needs to stop the killer! Once again Garcia is not up to the task (was he ever?) and reluctantly calls upon his old friend and his strange flying sidekick: the mythical Detective Case and the unmistakable Clown Bot.<br>Together, they will board on the express train, bother everyone by asking annoying questions, pick up everyone’s belongings and call them clues, drink and eat for free at the bar (because they are working after all!) and if all goes well, find and stop the express killer. <br>Oh, and they have to babysit Garcia’s kid because his mom is in Porto and Garcia is busy and since they are taking the train to Porto they might as well take him with them. What could go wrong, right?<br>Time for you to board on a brand new adventure filled with humor, cases (this time many cases!), mysteries, and even more characters now than ever before! Will you be able to gather clues, solve the puzzles, succeed the trials, and find the culprit before reaching the final station?!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/711920/extras/50cb3d7d02f2d866a35b5caf6a2ba85c.poster.avif?t=1634916188\" width=600 height=192 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/711920/extras/50cb3d7d02f2d866a35b5caf6a2ba85c.webm?t=1634916188\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/711920/extras/50cb3d7d02f2d866a35b5caf6a2ba85c.mp4?t=1634916188\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Characters:</strong><br>With the mythical <strong>Detective Case</strong>, also known as the world worst detective, a man so rough and rude that his witnesses would rather be run over by a slow-moving freight train than to be questioned by him. <br>The hilarious <strong>Clown Bot</strong> who, although he works as a Detective Case’s sidekick, he hopes in reality that one day he will get a job as a circus clown. Unfortunately, and no matter how many applications he sends, no circus will ever accept a clown that is afraid of children. He never sleeps, so besides working by day as a sidekick, he also works by night as a stand-up comedian in a local bar. People say that he is a joke machine!<br>And Garcia’s kid, what’s his name? Billy Joel?
