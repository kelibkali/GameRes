To solve the puzzles and survive the player will change the direction of gravity, not merely reversing it, but to any of the six directions. This will move the player as well as objects through space.  The puzzles are extremely varied with no two being the same, giving players a constant challenge and perpetual novelty. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nChoose carefully. Move wisely. Think quickly.",
