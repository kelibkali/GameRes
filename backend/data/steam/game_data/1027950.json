    "description": "Technomata is a new app to perform random techno music live. The user can interact with the music by randomising individual parts and mixing them on the fly as desired. Every sequence and sound shaping parameters are fully randomized to create a performance with endless variations. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n-Minimalistic and clean interface for an easy and intuitive interaction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Selectable tempo (BPM) to choose the speed of the performance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Auto mode makes the app perform by itself without the need of any user interaction. This mode allows the user to listen to an endless stream of techno music.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Bass cut FX to filter the low frequencies and create drops like a DJ.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-The sound engine is powered by a four parts drum machine and two synthesizers.",
