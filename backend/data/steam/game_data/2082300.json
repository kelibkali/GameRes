Inspired by games like Fable, Stronghold, Sims 4 and Civilization, Legacy puts you in the middle of the kingdom you are building. You will need to gather resources, build a great many different structures and research new technologies if your kingdom is to prosper. You cannot control other NPCs, however you can assign them jobs and give them orders and dress them however you want. You play the leader of a tribe and if they should die before naming an heir you can select an NPC to play.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2082300/extras/391ab229a31dd6edef5dcffaeb74ccdb.avif?t=1735594448\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2082300/extras_big/391ab229a31dd6edef5dcffaeb74ccdb.avif?t=1735594448 width=800 height=290 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A year in game is about three hours of play time so you have plenty of time to develop your characters. As your legacy continues, you pass on traits through your genealogy and through training. In Legacy you live as the king or queen in your kingdom. You make the rules and your citizens do your bidding. As more options get added your control will span across the people through laws, edicts and even through judgements made. Exploration, city building, character development, combat and diplomacy how you play is how you build your legacy.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2082300/extras/4c8ffe736a30c9b1a634a85da25c5b9c.avif?t=1735594448\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2082300/extras_big/4c8ffe736a30c9b1a634a85da25c5b9c.avif?t=1735594448 width=800 height=230 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >In time as your kingdom grows you will discover fascinating places in your land. You can train your troops, outfit them it the best gear you have and set out for adventure with dreams of great spoils and better gear. Losing people in battle however, can have devastating consequences. A good soldier might take days to condition and train.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2082300/extras/8cd380e00a8b7e70cee399d0a11aa5aa.avif?t=1735594448\" width=600 height=237 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Similar to other RPGs you need to make or loot better and better gear to take on bigger bosses. Some bosses require you to have help. So you will need to gear out your citizens and build an army. Although multiplayer is intended down the road, early on you'll be building raiding parties to lead into battle.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2082300/extras/307d6615a59cea40422459fae92e6e5c.avif?t=1735594448\" width=600 height=158 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This game is being made available in the pre-alpha stage for you who like the medieval city building genre so you can enjoy the game as it progresses at a lower price than the finished version. Each major update will be adding more buildings, gameplay, races, mobs and bosses.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2082300/extras/baad8f9338dd424286091ad1d4105ab8.avif?t=1735594448\" width=600 height=181 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >As the game develops past the initial release of version 1.0, updates will bring more expansions to the Legacy universe. The overall idea is to have a game where you start with a few people in the stone age and advance them all the way into a futuristic space age. Along with free updates we also plan to release DLC packs that offer different styles and types of objects that will appeal to different genres.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p>",
