This makes the story more digestible, and also means that the player can replay from a specific point in time, without having to create extra save slots.<br><br>► <strong>CHOICE-DEPENDENT STORY</strong> - As well as the main episodes, there will be individual routes for each heroine in the game. The routes are dependent on the choices made throughout these episodes, and those thereafter will affect the outcome to the heroine's story.<br><br>► <strong>MODERN PRESENTATION</strong> - Many interactive and dynamic elements have been incorporated into the gameplay. From emojis displaying when characters are in a certain mood, to the CG Inspection Mode that turns a static background into a point-and-click scenario, Tokyo Re:Connect aims to deliver mechanics that go beyond the norm.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1379090/extras/4dfe50b030f13fd9dce6526701089b9f.poster.avif?t=1595609175\" width=616 height=346 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1379090/extras/4dfe50b030f13fd9dce6526701089b9f.webm?t=1595609175\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1379090/extras/4dfe50b030f13fd9dce6526701089b9f.mp4?t=1595609175\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1379090/extras/c2fb1a1c39e20d38758ea31435f77607.webp?t=1595609175\"><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1379090/extras/c2fb1a1c39e20d38758ea31435f77607.poster.avif?t=1595609175\" class=\"bb_img\" width=616 height=347 /></picture></span><br><br>► <strong>CONTROLLER SUPPORT</strong> - Despite being released for the PC, this game supports the use of various controllers for the player's convenience.
