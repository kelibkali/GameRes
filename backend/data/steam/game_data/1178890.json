    "description": "Welcome back cat lovers! Finally we are there, our project is finally live and we can't wait to know what you think! We hope you like it and have your support. <br><br>Have fun!<br><br><strong>Demo:</strong><br><br>Don't waste any more time reading more and download our free demo. It represents only 5% of the complete game but at the same time it is the perfect prologue to our story. Immerse yourself in a soft feline world and evaluate our project in person!<br><br><strong><strong>Story: </strong></strong><br><br>• A long and articulated feline plot that will allow you to explore very serious topics alternating them with other fun moments. <br>• 5 stories parallel to the main plot that will allow you to get to know Taro's friends better.<br>• 3 main endings and as many secondary endings!<br>• A wide range of difficult choices that will change not only the story but also the relationships with the characters and their situation within the plot. <br>• A continuous change of perspective that will allow you to follow not only the events of the protagonist but also that of other characters, thus giving you the opportunity to relate to every situation. <br>• A complex, intriguing and realistic character backstory. <br><br><strong>Gameplay: </strong><br><br>• An immense vastness of different art and expressions capable of making the game feel dynamic and unique. <br>• A game perspective that will make you feel like an observer who has the power to change what's going on, with small first-person scenes sprinkled in to help you immerse yourself in specific situations even further. <br>• A wide range of backgrounds and angles that will allow the world to feel even more alive. <br>• A relaxing, light soundtrack, alternating with moments of tension and enriched with sound effects that will make each scene even more special. <br><br><strong>Details: </strong><br><br>A world of cats, a VERY soft character and crazy adventures... this slogan represents exactly the style of play we want to present. &quot;Taro&quot; is an ironic representation of the absurd reality that surrounds us that also performs the task of direct criticism towards it and is explored by a soft character full of defects who faces difficulties with self-irony and a unique style. Everything is further lightened by this imaginative world dominated by cats and by the way they manage society and their everyday life that almost verges on the absurd. A story represented by two opposite sides of the same medal that balances between light-hearted entertainment and dealing with difficult issues. All this is our starting point, our beginning. <br>This is a demo of the game that presents the opening sequence of our story. Although limited, as it represents only 5% of the complete game, we are proud to introduce you to it and we hope you will enjoy it. <br>Follow us here on Steam, on twitter, on Instagram or on our official website: Fantasiaofficialcompany to stay up to date on what's new in our game.",
