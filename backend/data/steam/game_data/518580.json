    "description": "Content warning: cartoon violence, gore, suicide, tax work.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNumbers. What do they mean?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe modern field of Accountancy is a serious and honorable profession. Many human beings have spent their lives toiling over the hard science of numbers. Thousands have died so that we may get to the level of understanding that we have today. Thousands have died. However, as Accountants and Numbersmiths embraced the abacus and the calculator, today we must embrace the latest technological advancement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVirtual Reality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn early 2016, three highly qualified Accountants came together to see what potential economic savings and visualisations could be achieved with The HTC Vive. These Accountants were quickly and discreetly discarded to be replaced by award-winning game studio Crows Crows Crows and the newly announced VR studio Squanchtendo, to create the ultimate electronic number-crunching program.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet’s get one thing straight: Accountancy is a mature profession and is not for children.",
