    "description": "Star Vortex is a casual game where you gather stars, avoid the asteroids and try to set a high score.<br><br>Each run lasts around 1 minute.<br><br>Star Vortex was developed for me to learn Steams tools, as such it is completely free. <br><br><strong>No Ads</strong><br><strong>No In App Purchases</strong><br><br>It uses GPU instancing and Burst compiler tech from Unity, which means it requires decent hardware to run since each individual star is simulated and there can be around 20k simulated at a time.",
