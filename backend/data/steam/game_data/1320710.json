    "description": "This game was originally inspired by sleep paralysis and the metaphysical theories surrounding astral projection being one of the gateways to high dimensions. The game tells a story about characters who struggle with their reality and falls victim to an antagonist who wants to keep them forever in the &quot;astral realm&quot;. The protagonist must face their fear, the antagonist: a version of themself that does not want to wake up, in order to save the others (who are also versions of them from other world lines).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game was made by 16 UCSC students from the games department.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCredits<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreative Director:\t\tTiffany Phan<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArt Producer:    \t\tTiffany Phan<br />\r\nTechnical Producer:\t        David Monroe<br />\r\nTechnical Lead:\t\tSeiji Emery, Rachel Haub<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\nMusic + Sound Design: \t\tCoy Youngblood<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLead Character Artist:\t\tErica Li<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLead Environmental Artist:       Sam Feng<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3D Artists:\t\t\t\tSam Feng, Erica Li, Eizi Yu<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVisual Effects + Shaders:        Sam Feng, Seiji Emery, Rachel Haub<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLead Programmer: \t\t        Seiji Emery<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay Programmers:        Seiji Emery, Vladislav Kardash, Rachel Haub<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdditional Programming:\tHardwin Bui, Lubin Tu, Brennen Mcculloch<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLevel Design:\t\t\t\tBenjamin Chen<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNarrative Director: \t\t\tKris Torres<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCutscene Design:\t\t\tTiffany Phan, Kris Torres, Hardwin Bui<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConcept Art:\t\t                Tiffany Phan, Erica Li, Sam Feng, Manon Lefebvre, Kris Torres<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t<br />\r\nUser interface + 2d Art:          Tiffany Phan, Kris Torres<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUser interface Programming: \tLubin Tu, Rachel Haub<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRigging + Animation:              Sam Feng, Eizi Yu, Erica Li, Sam Wolfe<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrailer + Marketing:\t\t        Tiffany Phan, Brennen Mcculloch<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany Thanks To:\t\t        Eddie Melcer<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t        Robin Hunicke<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t        Marcelo Viana Neto<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t        Elin Carstendottir<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t        Tad Leckman<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t        Max Kreminski<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t        Sean Douglas<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\nAll the folks at the CMPM + AGPM games depts at UCSC<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(and in particular, all of the fellow 17X students that we weathered together with under a global pandemic + everything else 2020 decided to throw at us, and still made some kick-ass games with regardless :) )<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd last but not least, all of our supportive friends + family, both in and outside of the UCSC games program\t<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCopyright 2020\t\t\tThe Glitch Escape Team<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanks for playing!",
