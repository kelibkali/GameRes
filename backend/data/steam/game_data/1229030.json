    "description": "<strong><i>A Hand With Many Fingers</i></strong> is a first-person investigative thriller. While searching a dusty CIA archive you uncover a real Cold War conspiracy. Every document you find has new leads to research. But the archive might not be as empty as you think…<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Slowly unravel a thrilling historical conspiracy<br></li><li>Discover new clues through careful archival research<br></li><li>Assemble your theories using corkboard and twine<br></li><li>Experience a story of creeping paranoia</li></ul><br><br><strong><u>How does it work?</u></strong><br><br>The archive is sorted by name, date, and location. Finding new clues requires all three pieces of info (e.g. <i>Frank Nugan</i>, <i>1980</i>, <i>Australia</i>). Every detail you need to know is hidden in the archive. But you’ll only find them if you know <i>who </i>was involved, <i>when </i>it happened, and <i>where </i>it took place. Average playtime for the game is around 1-2 hours.<br><br><br><strong>WARNING:</strong> This game may induce nausea, especially if you have a history of motion sickness. Adjusting the Field of View in the settings menu might help​. But if you're experiencing ongoing nausea, please stop the game immediately.",
