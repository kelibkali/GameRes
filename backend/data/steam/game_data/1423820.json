Some of the mine shafts date back as far as 1870-ties when it used to be a silver mine. Miner’s Hell will confront you not only with the dangers of modern mining, but also those that miners from centuries before had to face. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1423820/extras/03b21ae7368cc6b446a847368f3b6bc8.poster.avif?t=1750677782\" width=620 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1423820/extras/03b21ae7368cc6b446a847368f3b6bc8.webm?t=1750677782\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1423820/extras/03b21ae7368cc6b446a847368f3b6bc8.mp4?t=1750677782\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>While you start with modern equipment such as oxygen masks and sensors, you will have to learn old tricks to survive. Your modern equipment won’t cover all the dangers, neither can you use it all the time. Filters use up, batteries drain, things might get broken. You have to balance the usage and learn along the way how miners in the past dealt with situations and apply that knowledge.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1423820/extras/31e3de9a015cdc0131c4231e5a13e15e.poster.avif?t=1750677782\" width=620 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1423820/extras/31e3de9a015cdc0131c4231e5a13e15e.webm?t=1750677782\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1423820/extras/31e3de9a015cdc0131c4231e5a13e15e.mp4?t=1750677782\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>One of your most important tools is your radio. This way you stay in touch with the rescue team above ground that will guide you towards your goal. They aren’t always right, but they come up with good ideas on how to deal with certain problems. They also have maps of previous mining operations that took place here over the centuries and came up with the idea to use various old mine shafts to get to a spot they can break through. Unfortunately, old maps are not always reliable nor accurate and you’ll find yourself in situations where you will have to deal with the problems on your own.<br><br>Miner’s Hell is full of dangers and you won’t be able to avoid many of them. That is part of the game. You won’t die, flashbacks will bring you back to allow you to try a different approach, and a different one after that. This way you can focus on dealing with the various dangers rather than spend your time running back all the time.",
