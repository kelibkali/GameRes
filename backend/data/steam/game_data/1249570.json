    "description": "The soundtrack of Crew 167 was designed to be first and foremost ambient and reflective of the characters feeling throughout the game. As the player focuses on solving difficult puzzles, the music serves as a calm but textured background to help the player stay in the zone. The game contains three chapters that have their own personality that you can discover through the soundtrack.",
