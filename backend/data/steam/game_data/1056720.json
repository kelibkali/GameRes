Today!&quot; - Super Best Friends Play<br><br>&quot;KNYGHT CLUB 4 LYFE!&quot; - Dan Fornace, creator of Rivals of Aether<br><br>KNIGHT CLUB + Is a casual 2-4 player action platform-fighting game that brings traditional fighting game elements into an unlocked, free form movement playstyle. Equip your favorite armaments and do battle against your friends locally or online!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Updated for Steam!</h2>When we decided to update Knight Club with improved netplay features we thought why not go all out? We also updated the graphics, added all new Character Traits which makes each character unique, brought in some new characters, created some new stages, added an all-new dynamic camera, and rebalanced a bit. Knight Club is now better than ever!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Designed For Casual and Competitive Play</h2>Knight Club + has been built with competition in mind and features a slew of classic fighting game mechanics. It is also simple enough to help new players get into the fighting game genre. Counter hit, just defend, push block, wave dash, and cross up your way to victory!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Perfect For Parties</h2>Not in the mood for competition? No problem. Knight Club + has a handful of casual game modes that are perfect for 2-4 players!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Online Multiplayer</h2>No friends? No problem! Take the fight to random strangers online in any game mode, with up to 4 players!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >No Singleplayer</h2>Listen. This game does not have single player content. Do not buy this game if you want single player content. If you buy it, and then yell at me on Twitter or something because there is no single player, I'm going to tell you to kick rocks.",
