    "description": "„Cosmic Voyage“ is based on three of OUBEYs paintings which date from 1986/87. The first painting in the Experience is untitled, the second painting is called Nullfeld (Field Zero) and the final Experience painting was given the title Einsteins Tränen (Einstein’s Tears) some years after its creation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis VR takes you on a cosmic journey through the universe of OUBEYs paintings. Starting on Earth you are led into the far distant depths of space and back to the primeval beginnings of the universe. As you travel you’ll see how the globe of the Earth becomes ever more distant and smaller and smaller until it completely vanishes from your line of sight.",
