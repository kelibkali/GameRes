    "description": "<strong>Hi!</strong> I'm a dad making games under the name of Dad's Indie Studio. <br><br>Auri's Tales is a tiny game made with love and very few resources. I like to imagine that one day my daughter will play a little 3D adventure designed by his father and placed in a fantasy world which is based on her own life.<br><br>Auri’s Tales is a 3D adventure in which players will need to find their way to the castle to complete the game. The whole game is contained in a one single level that players can explore and evokes to classic 3D platformer games.<br><br>Jim Henson's Labyrinth, The legend of Zelda, Mario 64, Banjo Kazooie or Conker's Bad Fur Day are some of the influences that inspire this game in different ways.",
