    "description": "SLIVER.tv is a platform to record, view, and stream top esports games in fully immersive, 360 VR video. Our cutting edge, patented technology immerses the audience inside a 3D game world, viewing their favorite players and matches in an exciting new way never seen before. Many games that incorporate VR spectating require you to own the game or download a client; this is not one of those platforms. Instead, SLIVER.tv is a place to watch 360 VR game content from any source, similar to how one might currently watch a video on Youtube, or a streamer on Twitch!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Watch esports from inside the game</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Look up at the SKYCAM for a first person view</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>SLIVER.tv supports livestreaming in 360 VR</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>In game Teleporting to Bombsites A/B for CS:GO</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>LIVE Replays in VR</li></ul><br>SLIVER.tv is constantly adding new tools and features for the emerging VR community, and we can't do it alone.
