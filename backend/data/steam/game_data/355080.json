    "description": "Crazy Steam Bros is a classical horizontal shoot'em up inspired by the gameplay of old arcades. Anton and Dupont are brothers, inventors, and a little mad also! With the help of their landlady, Miss Lily, they must defeat the evil Baron and their hordes of moustached soldiers. Fly the &quot;SteaMobile&quot; trough five levels of steampunk action. Traverse cities, jungles, caves and more. Collect Power-Ups for your machine and defeat the bad tempered bosses before the tea time! <br><br>To play you can use the keyboard or a compatible gamepad, and Keys can be redefined at the options menu.<br><br>Predefined keys are:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Arrows for movement for player 1, &quot;RFDG&quot; keys for player 2<br></li><li>&quot;K&quot; key for player 1, &quot;Q&quot; key for player 2:<br>Shooting. It will activate all your weapons, except bombs and air mines. This is a game with automatic autofire, so there's no need to ravage your keyboard or your fingers :D<br></li><li>&quot;L&quot; key for player 1, &quot;W&quot; key for player 2:<br>Bombing. Hitting things with bombs is trickier, but the damage done by them is huge! This also activates air mines, if you have collected them.<br></li><li>&quot;P&quot; key:<br>Press it in game to show the pause menu.<br></li><li>&quot;ESC&quot; key:<br>To finish and quit the game.</li></ul><br>Gameplay is easy. Just advance trough the levels and survive the battle against the stage's bosses.<br>Eventually, Miss Lily will drop random powerups. Collect them for increased firepower.<br>These powerups have a limited life, so use them sparingly.<br><br>The different powerups are:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Supershoot:    <br>Increased damage for the machinegun.<br></li><li>Trishoot:    <br>The machinegun will shot in three directions at once.<br></li><li>Air Mines:    <br>They will pursue the nearby enemies.<br></li><li>Tesla Shield:    <br>A force field that will protect you against enemies shots.<br></li><li>Rocket:    <br>A powerful weapon, but not much precise.<br></li><li>Super Bomb:    <br>This bomb will release a pair of normal bombs after exploding.<br></li><li>Tesla Cannon:   <br>An electro ray that will hit the nearby enemies without need to aim.<br></li><li>Tesla Drones:    <br>You can collect up to two of them. They will protect you from the damage, and also shoot a laser ray. They can be damaged and destroyed by enemy fire.</li></ul>",
