    "description": "Welcome home, pardner! We've been waiting for you here in the town of Sanctuary. Take your boots off and sit a spell. Ex-Marshal James Anderson lived a quiet life with his wife and daughter. One black day that life was shattered by a fancy-dressed, greed driven land baron intent on plowing down his farm to make way for the railroad. Now Anderson's driven by revenge, which he'll exact in a spray of gunfire.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGet ready for the good, the bad, and the even worse. As Marshall James Anderson, you'll face a horde of ornery, gun-slinging outlaws. You'll shoot your way through a twisted plot of greed and revenge. You'll arm yourself with firearms, as well as your wits. So go ahead, and make your day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n• Highly stylized characters with distinct personalities and weapons.<br />\r\n• Gameplay involving puzzle solving to tease the mind as well as the trigger finger.<br />\r\n• Combines first-person Gun Slinging Action and Wild West Adventure in one game.",
