    "description": "This metagame is a parody of amateur adventure design, this metagame consists of a simple treasure hunting game, and a complex editor needed to complete it. The editor and its assistant Cuppit are all part of the game; anyone involved in game or level design should appreciate the humor.<br><br>The editor is an exercise of twisted logic and lateral thinking. You have to see it to believe it; with its offbeat controls, inventory items that kill you, and intentional misspellings, it's the weirdest thing since sliced bread!<br><br>META is based on Adventure Game Studio, the platform for most of our games, and is runner-up for two AGS Awards.<br><br><i>&quot;A great game, with some of the best puzzles I have ever seen in an AGS game. Kudos!&quot;</i> - David Cooper<br><i>&quot;Possibly the most original concept I've ever seen in an AGS game! ... The puzzles are deviously ingenious. This is what I like - thinking outside the box!&quot;</i> - Trovatore",
