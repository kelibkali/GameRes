    "description": "ZombWave is a 2d, top down zombie arena shooter game with roguelike element. In this game  you have only one job, SURVIVE.<br />\r\nThis is a hardcore game where every mistake is punished. No one level will be the same, because in this game is a implemented a random spawn enemy. That the reason why is a each gameplay a different.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n You improve your character in the game. But be careful, if a character dies or you leaves the level before completing it, you will lose all the improvements you have<br />\r\nYou unlock the characters while playing. Every fifth level you get a new character with a different weapon and little different skills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is my first game and i will try to improve it in the future as well. Thank you for understanding. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n Well enjoy the game. :)",
