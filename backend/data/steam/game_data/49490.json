    "description": "Fully-unlocked “Ghoulkeeper” black deck. The power of undeath is yours to command with this gruesome collection of necromantic spells. One Zombie itself is a terrifying sight, but you’ll be attacking with many more than that. Death itself is nothing to fear: you have several spells that can return a creature from the graveyard for another twisted trip to the battlefield. Finish your opponent off with the unparalleled might of Grave Titan and its ceaseless torrent of rotting, shambling Zombies. Additional content for Magic: The Gathering — Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012. (Requires the most recent version of Magic 2012 and Magic 2012 Deck Pack 1.)",
