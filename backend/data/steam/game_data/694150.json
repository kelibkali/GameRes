    "description": "Hello there oh so terrible gladiator, and welcome to the ultimate tournament organised by the gods!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>ABYSSAL FAAA</strong>aaall!...</h2><br>*couch* sorry, you will have to fight in some of the most dangerous places in the world, battling against your peers on top of crumbling arenas in order to be the last one standing, be a champion and avoid being an abyssal fail!<br><br>Take control of 4 distinct heroes from across time and try to win the most incredible of prizes, <br>A full week-end in the outback of Australia with all costs covered... (*conditions may apply **only available to dead people)<br><br>Prepare to lose most of your remaining friends in a fast paced action game where every tile of the map will fall one second after you step on it,<br>Trap, bait &amp; pressure your opponents in order to make them do a mistake and punish them with your special ability.<br><br><br>Abyssal fall is the first game made by a young and (very) tiny team of french developers mainly composed by students, so every bit of feedback is appreciated.<br>For the little story, this project was created in an GameWeek in IsartDigital School. Abyssal Fall won the &quot; Best Gameplay Price &quot; and the &quot; Big Price of the Jury &quot;.<br><br>The game contains :<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Local or online multiplayer<br></li><li> 3 game modes (Classic, Deathmatch, Relic)<br></li><li> 3 maps with crumbling ground<br></li><li> 4 characters</li></ul><br>After the release, we intend to evolve the game in a totally free way. We want to add a lot of things like:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Environment interactions (Storms, water geysers...)<br></li><li> New game modes (Zombie, Hardcore...)<br></li><li> New maps<br></li><li> New characters<br></li><li> And why not some bots too?</li></ul><br>Do not hesitate to propose your ideas, we will see what we can put in place,<br>Share this game around and help us bring more content to this little adventure.<br><br>Thank you for your support :)",
