Players can access at any given moment this simple yet powerful editor, to set cameras and their movement paths at different keyframes, creating spectacular video sequences, ready to share with the game’s Community and Social Networks. You could take a screenshot too!<br><br><strong>Powerful Park Editor: </strong><br>Through the use of a simple but powerful set of park editing tools, create incredible parks to ride.
