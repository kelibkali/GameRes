    "description": "<strong>A Collection of Dark and Daring Adventures</strong><br><i><br>What happens when adventurers become the owners of a brothel? When a roguish associate asks them to attend an oligarch's party in his place? What lurks in the Cartways besides kobolds? And what will you say when another thief tells you the only way to find a treasure is to become hunted by the Praetors?</i><br><i><br>Dark dealings, my boys, and a knife in the guts might be the price. Whose guts? Might be yours if you cross the wrong one of the Nine.</i><br>This supplement and adventure anthology is set in the seedy underbelly of Zobeck, and on its mean streets you will find:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Seven adventures dealing with underhanded themes, shady locations, and double-crossing deals gone wrong<br></li><li>Six locales including the Cartways Market Gallery or the Old Stross Municipal Baths.<br></li><li>A dirty dozen NPCs: kobold gearsmiths, failed Arcane Collegium students, barge captains, fey and undead ambassadors to use as rivals, patrons, peers and foes<br></li><li>A sampling of new clockworks, street magics and odd enchantments that make Zobeck the distinctive jewel of the River Argent!</li></ul><strong>You probably shouldn't bring the paladin along on this one...</strong><br>This official<br><strong>Midgard</strong><br>adventure anthology is easily portable to any setting. Designed by<br><strong>Ben McFarland, Chris Harris, Matthew Stinson, Christina Stiles, Mike Franke, and Richard Pett</strong>.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Ryan Weathers</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included 5E Compatible ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
