Her soul was born with an unknown fearsome potential, and hence, upon her death, some unknown being split her soul (and memories) into 8 souls.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Her main soul, although now pure without sin, is very weak. The 7 lost souls, represents the 7 sins - in normal cases, every human soul has these 7 sins.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >She has to collect and find/meet her other 7 souls that are scattered in Hell, before she can face the devil, Lucifer. As she tries to find these souls, she slowly finds clues of her past and bit by bit, recovers her memories.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >However, it is not all as it seems - there are rumors surrounding creation and Heaven. Is Lucifer really to blame? What sin did she commit that made her deserve to go to Hell? The future of the universe is in her hands.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p>",
