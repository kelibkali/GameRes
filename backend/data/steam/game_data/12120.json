Where filmstars and millionaires do their best to avoid the dealers and gangbangers. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, it's the early 90s. Carl's got to go home. His mother has been murdered, his family has fallen apart and his childhood friends are all heading towards disaster. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn his return to the neighborhood, a couple of corrupt cops frame him for homicide. CJ is forced on a journey that takes him across the entire state of San Andreas, to save his family and to take control of the streets.",
