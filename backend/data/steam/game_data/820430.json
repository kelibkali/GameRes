    "description": "Crystals and Curses is a super challenging puzzle game where players must constantly alter their way of thinking to solve new puzzles. Each world presents new mechanics that change the rules of the puzzles. There are boss battles, riddles, unlockable lore, and secrets which we are not at liberty to discuss.<br><br>Welcome to Asterra, where the puzzles are cursed, the lobsters gamble, and riddles lead you somewhere you never expected. <br><br>Stargazers Equi and Nox journey across Asterra, shattering curses and adding members to their party. They must solve puzzles that are ever evolving as they pursue the source of the terrible curses. Along the way, they meet haunted suits of armor, enchanted flying hats, and ancient tree spirits. Are they doomed to die a fiery, puzzley death?<br><br>Note: Crystals &amp; Curses relies heavily on teal, red, and white for puzzling mechanics. Those who are color blind may have issues differentiating these colors. Our apologies, we do not support a color bind mode yet!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/820430/extras/01d9f372a42da3f4446baa8a8f96f356.avif?t=1527120911\" width=140 height=102 /></span>",
