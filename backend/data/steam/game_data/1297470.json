It appears that they too committed suicide. The inter generational double suicides, from now on known as Rethan cases, are one of the most mysterious and unexplained cases in the career of the young private investigator Sally Harrison, who has now been assigned to solve the cases. As a player, you will uncover parts of the dark past and each new clue will scare and frighten you. It's up to you to find out the truth. But will you run away or will you try everything to uncover what happened?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Game mechanics</h2>In Inconsistencies you are absolutely on your own. With no weapons to help you, you have to fight the strange incidents with your mind alone. By solving complex puzzles and finding clues, you will gain more and more information about what really happened in the house. Your decisions to deal with certain situations also have a major impact on the game. It is quite possible that you will miss many of the decisive clues if you don't pay attention to the small details.<br>   <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1297470/extras/627859757149452754f6fdce06278abf.avif?t=1715153886\" width=632 height=296 /></span><br>   <br>Your psyche becomes weaker and weaker as you surrender to your fears.
