    "description": "<strong>Outwit gravity, race the clock, explore new worlds.</strong><br><br>Crashed lander is a gravity-based arcade game inspired by classics like Lunar Lander and Space Taxi. You've built a janky craft out of propane tanks and spare parts. Pilot it  from pad to pad trying to beat your best time – then flirt with that fine line between speed and control. <br><br>If you’re brave enough to try Hard Mode you’ll be flopping around like a QWOPy, low gravity turtle. With a little practice you’ll be zippin' around doin' barrel rolls. You’ll see sites from the cutting edge of fractal mathematics – bizarre, organic shapes, arcane archaeological digs, and all manner of WTFderful alien vistas. Each level is a  hand-crafted environment that encourages the player to explore - and goof around! You can also pilot your lander in virtual reality with your Rift, Vive, or other SteamVR compatible headset. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>25 levels to conquer and explore in pad Hopper mode<br></li><li>25 levels in Ring Runner mode - fly through custom courses<br></li><li>Play in VR. Works on monitors plus Rift, Vive, and other SteamVR headsets.<br></li><li>Full (xbox 360) controller support<br></li><li>Hidden collectibles on every level<br></li><li>Earn stars and track your progress through all 50 levels<br></li><li>An hour of spacey, glitch-hop music - mp3's included!<br></li><li>Achievements and Global Leaderboards.<br></li><li>Windows, OSX, and Linux!</li></ul><br><strong>Version 3.1 is available now</strong> with better performance, improved VR support, new options menu, new tutorial, and a first person camera mode. <br><br>Crashed Lander was part of the first wave of VR games on Steam.
