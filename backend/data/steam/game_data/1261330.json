Do you wonder if they could ever lie to you? What if everything you’ve ever known to be real was a fiction?<br><br>Our protagonist awakens in a bleak prison cell. In the reflection of a fractured mirror stares back a haunted, disfigured face. He can’t recall what happened, or how he wound up as a prisoner... only his name. Anhel. He finds a note written by a girl, Mia, pleading for help while warning of an evil that stalks the corridors.<br><br>Anhel thinks his way out of the cell, taking him deeper into the twisting bowels of the bunker. He is met by the aftermath of a bloody massacre-only, the corpses are all gone. Indeed, Anhel may well be the only one left alive or dead.
