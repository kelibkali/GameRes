    "description": "<u><strong>Overview</strong></u><br>Players choose a faction and place units in their build area. Buying, positioning and upgrading the right units is key to victory. <br>After a set time period, your army spawns and moves towards the enemy. All movements, attacks and abilities are automatically executed, making this a relaxing yet strategic game. You are constantly triggered to counter enemy strategies and to adapt. You gain more income as the game continues, enabling you to build stronger units and buy more unique upgrades and abilities that may turn the tied of battle in your (team's) favor and finally destroy your opponent's Ring Gate through countless waves of enemies! <br><br>There are tons of different possibilities to try (especially in team tactics with different factions). This makes sure that every game experience is different!<br><br><br><u><strong>Features</strong></u><br>. More than 30 unique units (upcoming +20 unique units)<br>. With 70+ unique upgrades (upcoming +30 unique upgrades)<br>. 3 different factions (upcoming +2 new factions)<br>. Different maps<br>. Different game modes<br>. Play vs. AI<br>. Single player and multiplayer (matches up to 6 players)<br>. Easy to join with friends and play co-op<br>. Achievements<br>. Plenty more content to come!<br><br><br><u><strong>Continuous development!</strong></u><br>We are a 2-man team working with great dedication on this game. We will continuously keep improving the game, adding content, features and more much. For us, this is only the beginning. We have so much more ideas we want to share with you but we'll approach it one step at a time. Player feedback is very much appreciated (even a special button available for this) and we would like nothing more than this to become your favorite game and that only works if we listen to you ;)<br><br><br><strong><u>Below some gifs to give a bit insight in the game feeling</u></strong><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625090/extras/8ec7c5f820989439ffdbc46b132e38f4.poster.avif?t=1671919410\" width=598 height=402 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625090/extras/8ec7c5f820989439ffdbc46b132e38f4.webm?t=1671919410\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625090/extras/8ec7c5f820989439ffdbc46b132e38f4.mp4?t=1671919410\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625090/extras/7935233c9d7d3da5c103f1ae0b4c62dd.poster.avif?t=1671919410\" width=800 height=394 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625090/extras/7935233c9d7d3da5c103f1ae0b4c62dd.webm?t=1671919410\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625090/extras/7935233c9d7d3da5c103f1ae0b4c62dd.mp4?t=1671919410\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625090/extras/dae475074dd4f01f3d0fca45ed194a31.poster.avif?t=1671919410\" width=468 height=254 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625090/extras/dae475074dd4f01f3d0fca45ed194a31.webm?t=1671919410\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625090/extras/dae475074dd4f01f3d0fca45ed194a31.mp4?t=1671919410\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
