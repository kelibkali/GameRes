    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >   D&amp;D Classics: B2 The Keep on the Borderlands</h2>This module includes a cover folder with maps and a complete description booklet to form a ready-made scenario for DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS(R) Basic Set. It has been specially designed for use by beginning Dungeon Masters so that they may begin play with a minimum of preparations.<br>Within are many features to aid novice players and Dungeon Masters: legends, history and background information, a list of adventuring characters, tips on how to be an effective Dungeon Master, plus an interesting area for characters to basethemselves in (the Keep) before setting out to explore the Caves of Chaosl<br><i>   We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today. Some older content may reflect ethnic, racial, and gender prejudice that were commonplace in American society at that time. These depictions were wrong then and are wrong today. This content is presented as it was originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed. Dungeons &amp; Dragons teaches that diversity is a strength, and we strive to make our D&amp;D products as welcoming and inclusive as possible. This part of our work will never end.</i><br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Team Twohy LLC, and Mike Wilson</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the D&amp;D Classics - AD&amp;D 1E/2E ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
