Start looking for resources and build your own house, for every house you build more people will come to your kingdom. You can give tasks to your villagers, so they start gathering resources. With the resources that your villagers are gathering, you can expand your kingdom or go to the market and exchange them for other resources, or improve your equipment.<br><br>Recruit an army and prepare to attack other kingdoms or to defend yours. Become the greatest kingdom, or find other adventures in this medieval world.<br><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1294370/extras/7d72673fab4c72f242d92b43eb77b20e.avif?t=1592415257\" width=580 height=75 /></span><br><br>To build your kingdom you will need resources, you can find them by chopping trees or mining rocks. Once you have enough you will have the option to build entire buildings or just small parts and customize them . Buildings that are already completed will have functions such as recruiting units or other functions like having a blacksmith that will help you create tools. You can also upgrade building, for example if you upgrade a house more people will be able to live inside. The more houses you build, the more people will live in it, which will help you to grow your kingdom. Build walls and towers so the enemies can't attack you.<br><br>     <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1294370/extras/c01778d41d688c8abe7c6ce334d046fa.avif?t=1592415257\" width=580 height=220 /></span><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1294370/extras/c540568558a1f1dab51d44baaf5eaaa7.avif?t=1592415257\" width=580 height=75 /></span><br><br>Having a kingdom with a large population will cost you more resources, if you don't want your villagers to starve, give them task to do, like serching for food or gather resources.
