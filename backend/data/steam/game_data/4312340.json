In the demo, the player arrives at EPOS 11 in the midst of chaos, where completing the initial objectives gradually reveals that something has gone terribly wrong on the station.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The focus is on <strong>atmosphere, exploration, and environmental storytelling</strong>. As players traverse abandoned corridors, interact with terminals, and collect various clues, they slowly piece together what may have happened to the crew. The horror does not rely on sudden jump scares, but instead builds a constantly growing sense of tension and oppressive unease.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The demo introduces the game’s <strong>core mechanics</strong>, environmental puzzles, and the way narrative progression unfolds, while providing a taste of the world and atmosphere of EPOS 11. The story in this version is not yet complete; its purpose is to establish tension and spark interest in the full experience.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The demo offers approximately <strong>30–60 minutes of gameplay</strong>, depending on the level of exploration.</p>",
