    "description": "Slaughterhouse is a third-person, horror, cover-shooter that takes you to a place that has rarely been explored, the world of sentient cows! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe head of a corrupt Slaughterhouse has just learned that his head scientist has accidentally fused himself with their bovine experiment and is now sympathetic with the cows! He quickly locks down the facility and sends out his best goons and experiments to take down the newly formed cow/human hybrid before it can escape and reveal his secrets to the world. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs this cow/human hybrid, you have no choice but to blast, charge and moo your way out of the Slaughterhouse before it's too late. The fate of the bovine world rests in your hands!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey Features:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnjoy hilarious quips nestled within the horror, fast-paced combat, and unique cow abilities, including a charge and milk slick, while you wreak havoc with your trusty rifle and shotgun to destroy whoever or whatever crosses your path!",
