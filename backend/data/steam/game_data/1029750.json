    "description": "Voipas is a virtual assistant for PC. The new version includes a chat feature. You can interact with your friends through gestures, not only text. You can add only 7 friends, your true friends. Because who can keep up with more ? This is not a social app where you can have thousand of friends who you probably never talked to.<br />\r\nThere is a mobile version for android. The changes you make on PC or phone would reflect on the other device, except some basic data.<br />\r\nThe NPC can give you an advice when you feel down, cheer you, give you a virtual kiss or remind you to study for exams. You can own a dog and pet him whenever you want.<br />\r\nFor now, the overlap effect is not constant in time. (fixed in v0.93)<br />\r\nOver 50 phrases including:<br />\r\n-How was your day at work?<br />\r\n-How was your day at school?<br />\r\n-Did you study for your exam? It's better to begin studying earlier.<br />\r\n-Don't forget to study for your exam.<br />\r\n-Good luck with the exam.<br />\r\n-It's late, I think you should go to sleep.<br />\r\n-It's so late, you better go to sleep.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can leave us a message here or on our website with your suggestions.",
