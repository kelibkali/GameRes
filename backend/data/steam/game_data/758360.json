After decades, one victor emerged - the evil sorcerer Lord Ghastur. Even with his powers weakened, Lord Ghastur started his work to imprison the free spirited dragons by separating their spirits from their physical bodies which he used to tap the remaining mana reserves. The dragons put up a good fight but Lord Ghastur's powers were too great. Only one dragon - Ryaver the Crimson managed to re-open the dimensional portal to the human world to call for help, before being imprisoned himself. <br><br>You have heard the call. Your goal is to release as many dragons as possible by merging the prisons of body and spirit into one. Move fast human, your time is running out!",
