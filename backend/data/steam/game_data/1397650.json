    "description": "<strong>Jetborne Racing</strong> is an online multiplayer air racing game from the creator of VTOL VR. Pilot a high performance jet aircraft through challenging courses in a race to the finish. Fly in VR (recommended) or on desktop with either virtual or physical HOTAS controls. Compete in up to 8-player online races or run hot laps to rank in global lap-time leaderboards. Get immersed in the heart-pounding sensation of flying over Mach 1 through tight and and technical race courses. Do you have what it takes for a podium position?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Take Control</h2>Fly using the innovative and immersive virtual stick and throttle, popularized by VTOL VR, <i>or</i> bind your hardware HOTAS! The key to victory is mastering control of your aircraft and finding the perfect racing line. Life-like aerodynamics and physics are simulated, so fundamental racing concepts like braking points and apexes apply.  If you're familiar with road racing, you may need to adjust your technique -- there's now a third dimension and instead of being limited by traction, you need to consider the limits of G-forces on the pilot! <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1397650/extras/8282bfcb6c3257409b1d9e3a13542e99.poster.avif?t=1625066280\" width=600 height=100 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1397650/extras/8282bfcb6c3257409b1d9e3a13542e99.webm?t=1625066280\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1397650/extras/8282bfcb6c3257409b1d9e3a13542e99.mp4?t=1625066280\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Feel the Need</h2>Throttle up your lightweight race jets and propel yourself at supersonic speeds around winding courses. You can only handle so much force before you begin to black out -- if you carry too much speed into the corner, you might lose control! Will you risk G-LOC (G-force induced loss of consciousness) to come out in first on the other side? Can you ride the fine line between pushing the limits and wiping out in a blaze of glory?<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1397650/extras/b7d991b3bd28d4718203dd2363387c25.poster.avif?t=1625066280\" width=600 height=100 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1397650/extras/b7d991b3bd28d4718203dd2363387c25.webm?t=1625066280\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1397650/extras/b7d991b3bd28d4718203dd2363387c25.mp4?t=1625066280\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Get Competitive</h2>Host online races for up to 8 players or play offline to chase the ghost of your own best lap and set personal records.
