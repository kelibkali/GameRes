We concentrated our best effort on the firing and enemy tank explosion animations as we think these are the two most satisfying actions that the you experiences. When firing, tank’s gun recoils, air shock wave and nozzle fire created. Enemies recoil and exploding when hit. After exploding, tank burning bodies remains. Also the tank movement is also treated well with tank acceleration and braking animation. When moving, tank body goes up and down relative to its treads, this make it looks realistic as tanks move through bumpy terrains.Tanks leave dust, smoke and tread mark on ground behind.</ul><br>For more info, please visit :<br>",
