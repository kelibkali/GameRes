A bitter snow storm has driven the country folk to the warmth and safety of their household fires, as a bleak midwinter drowns the world in white. The storm has disturbed the spirits, the ghosts of Northfield from ages past, they wander the Carrion Woods and long forgotten graveyards. Some are lost souls, damned by actions long ago, whereas others seek revenge and retribution.",
