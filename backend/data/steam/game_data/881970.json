    "description": "Shooter &quot;Pif Paf&quot; the game in which the shooting is carried out with the help of voice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn order for the spacecraft to be able to destroy the hazards by shots, it is necessary to say in the microphone &quot;PIF-PAF&quot;, &quot;BAKH-BAKH&quot;, &quot;BOOM-BOOM&quot;, &quot;DUM-DUM&quot; and the like.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game isn't as simple as it can appear at first glance because requires physical endurance and this creates a unique way of playing when the player gasps for air and his focus and concentration fails. The player will need good endurance and the ability to correctly distribute his forces in order to score the maximum number of points<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you first start the game, you may need to adapt the microphone to work with the game. Go to the Description and do a few shots. If the shooting goes wrong restart the game and try again. When testing the game on different computers after this shooting was carried out correctly, don’t forget to check the microphone sensitivity in the settings.",
