    "description": "Choose your Blocks, Build your Castle, Save the Kingdom! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCastle constructor is a new and unique tower defense game. Design your castle how you want it using a modular system of unique, interlocking, interworking blocks. Stack them up high or spread them out across the map as you try to build the perfect defense. Landscapes like deserts, mountains, rivers, and hills come with their own advantages and challenges. Fend off waves of enemies who will try to climb over and break through your defenses in their attempt to capture your keep. From lowly soldiers to powerful siege weapons, you will need to defeat them all as you strive to protect your kingdom.",
