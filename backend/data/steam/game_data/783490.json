Help Blot along on his quest to take down the fearsome dictator known as <strong>Art</strong>. Shoot, propel, and pogo your way through dozens of challenging levels to fulfill Blot's destiny!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/783490/extras/KeyFeatures.png?t=1577222100\" /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A unique, physics-based way of movement.<br></li><li>Quirky humor and jokes. <i>Is this a plus?

Fling your way across dozens of levels with your trusty gatling gun of doom. Try your best not to die, but believe me, you are going to be dying.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/783490/extras/Gameplay.png?t=1577222100\" /></span><br>You live, you die, you live again. In Gatlin', your main methods of problem solving are your eyes and learning from your mistakes. Upon dying, you are sent back to the start of the level to run through it again until you do it right.<br><br>I hear you asking, <i>&quot;What causes me to die?&quot;</i> That is an oddly-morbid question, but a question I will answer nonetheless. You'll die to classical art, you'll die to spikes, you'll die to weird demented clones, and you'll die to tears. By the way, that last thing is both <u>figurative</u> and <u>literal</u>.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/783490/extras/BossFights.png?t=1577222100\" /></span><br>The boss fights in Gatlin' are sentient bullet hells gone rogue. Fear not! They have patterns and tricks that you will likely get accustomed to.<br><br>Each boss also reveals  <strong>c</strong>  <strong>r</strong>  <strong>i</strong>  <strong>s</strong>  <strong>p</strong>  <strong>y</strong>  lore and each boss harbors an unforgettable personality - so that's pretty neat I guess.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/783490/extras/Speedrunning.png?t=1577222100\" /></span><br>Gatlin' was and will always be designed with all types of player in mind. If you wish to go slow or fast, the level design panders to all. That said, <strong>we highly encourage speedrunning</strong>.",
