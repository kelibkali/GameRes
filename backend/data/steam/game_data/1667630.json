In order to reach the source of a virus that could change their fate, you must navigate and find your way past several floors of a labyrinth filled with dangerous enemies, magical traps and portals, and mysterious artifacts.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Two Challenges At Once</h2>While you try to avoid getting lost in the maze, whether through placeable land markers, memorization, or mapping the floors out on graph paper in the real world, you also must gather gear and magic scripts of code to defend yourself in turn-based combat.",
