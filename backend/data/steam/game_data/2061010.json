Some moments you’re in first person, other times you’re floating like a camera on mushrooms—either way, no rules, no scores, just visuals that get weirder the longer you stare. It’s a universe that doesn’t need you to win—just to <i>let go</i>. You can visit celestials. There is a virtual art gallery.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2061010/extras/f709c9decbe7c9de05d50275f10a2223.poster.avif?t=1757973528\" width=610 height=344 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2061010/extras/f709c9decbe7c9de05d50275f10a2223.webm?t=1757973528\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2061010/extras/f709c9decbe7c9de05d50275f10a2223.mp4?t=1757973528\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Other details</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >- 4K Graphics</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >- HD Audio</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >- Virtual Art Museum</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >- Replicas of the Sun, Earth, Moon, and Jupiter can be found</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >- Different star types, blue, red, orange</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >- Different black holes</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >- And more</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Ambient music will be included but can be turned off if you want to listen to your own music.
