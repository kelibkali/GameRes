    "description": "4 balls (Ed, Tru, Miles &amp; John) were captured by Gnark Gnark an alien coming from far far away.<br />\r\nHe brought them to &quot;Swap Swap&quot; a labyrinth world with evil mechanisms to study their specie.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRules of &quot;Swap Swap&quot; are simple, but don't fall into the trap, appearance can be deceptive.<br />\r\nHelp our 4 friends to get out from this evil world using switches, teleports, bumpers and many machiavelic tricks...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBe very careful, walls will certainly swap their positions to help you... or not.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSwap Swap is a very addictive puzzle game. Get them out with a minimum of moves and be the best of the ones who have what it takes... to free their balls ;-)",
