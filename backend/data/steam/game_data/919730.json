You have no means of defending yourself, instead you need to find your way around the zombies by locking them into rooms, luring them out of the way or playing them out against each other.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n14 levels with a total playtime of about 1 hour.<br />\r\nNO grabbing of objects, instead you just press a button to interact.",
