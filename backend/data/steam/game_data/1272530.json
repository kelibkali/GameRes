    "description": "Don’t stand still. Don’t turn back. And don’t trust your eyes. Step into Looking Glass, a PC horror VR game set in the darkness of a hedge labyrinth. Peer through the blackness—and keep tabs on the strange figures surrounding you—using nothing but a hand mirror.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere’s no map. No walkthrough. And no two mazes are the same. Looking Glass takes cues from the golden era of mouse-and-keyboard horror—but it's built for virtual reality. Discover strange landmarks, vaulted passages, and a landscape both suspenseful and serene. Grab your Index, Rift, or Vive and try one of the best VR horror games on Steam.",
