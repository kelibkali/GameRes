    "description": "A 2D platformer set in a world of floating islands where gravity acts with strange properties and can point in any direction. Join one of 4 characters as they venture through strange and wonderful environments that twist and turn in all directions, as they each try to achieve different goals within a larger overarching plot. Throughout the levels there are arrows that when touched, will change the gravity on the character and parts of the environment, and the player must use these gravity switches and the character's various abilities to navigate through the environment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe world of this game was once shook by a great tragedy a long time ago that broke it apart into these floating islands, and now history seems to be repeating itself, and could potentially cause even more damage. Each character is on a different side of this conflict, but by the end after learning of the events of the past, must unite against a larger threat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is a mix of an action and puzzle platformer featuring tons of beautifully drawn pixel art, and animations that have a lot of personality, and attention to detail. The physics are fluid and dynamic allowing for very free movement, the player must also learn to manipulate the environment and gravity in order to get around. Each character has their own techniques for combat, and many of these combat options can also be used as additional movement tech, such as throwing a hammer that can be used to jump on, or shooting a laser that the player can also ride!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCast:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKimiko, The telekinetic rabbit - Despite her cute appearance, this girl packs some serious power! She wields a large hammer that can be thrown around to inflict large damage, and she can also steal projectiles from enemies using her telekinesis and use them to attack, or as platforms to jump to higher places. Kimiko also has the ability to affect gravity on herself, allowing her to briefly float, and also temporarily flip gravity on herself without us of the gravity switches.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRika, the doll master - Rika is the only human in the main cast, meaning that she doesn't have any inherently magical abilities, but she shouldn't be underestimated! Rika is incredibly athletic, allowing her to scale tight areas with wall jumps, and also giving her the fastest run speed of all 4 girls. However Rika's most powerful asset is her floating doll that can attack enemies at range, shoot lasers, and tether to Rika allowing her to swing off walls and ceilings<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMima, the firey dragon - This girl will burn down all that stand against her! She can shoot fireballs as a means of attack, or can curl up into her wings, and shoot herself as a fireball, bowling through enemies. She is immune to all types of fire damage, including being able to swim in lava! She can also use her large wings to fly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSaki, the shape-shifting tanuki - Saki is a bit of a wildcard in the cast. Having lost her right arm during childhood and becoming disabled, Saki is missing a few core abilities shared by the rest of the cast, such as climbing and swimming, but she makes up for it with a short-range teleport that passes right through solid walls. She can also morph her body, allowing her to melt into an amorphous purple goo, or stretch her body as a means of attack.",
