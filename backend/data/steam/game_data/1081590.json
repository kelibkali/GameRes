Learn the adventuring ropes from a mighty knight and fight monsters and dragons to save the day - but remember - the most important parts of being a hero are bravery, heroism and not asking too many questions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Over 31 unique enemies to fight.<br></li><li>More than makes up for an apparent lack of quality with sparkling wit and puddles of character.<br></li><li>Remarkably generic but still adequate story-line.<br></li><li>Absolutely no twists or turns.<br></li><li>If anyone tells you that more interesting things happens in this game just ignore them.<br></li><li>Just cut them out of your life.<br></li><li>Also, this whole game was basically made by one guy.<br></li><li>I did get some help with the music and some small coding things.<br></li><li>But beside that it was all me. </li></ul>",
