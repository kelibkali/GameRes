You play as Kelsey, remembering Marie's room as it was twenty years ago. But something’s off. What happened to Marie?</strong><br><br><i>“There was nothing I could do about the past. It was definite as hell.” - Kelsey</i><br><br>Kelsey has come back to a room packed up in boxes. She has one goal - get Marie’s journal. When she picks it up, the memories come back. Because twenty years ago Kelsey and Marie shared this room. They spent days in it working on projects, nights talking about boys, pizza and sparkly shoes. Dreaming about the future, planning their life. Until that ghastly night. When it was all shattered to pieces.<br><br>What happened to Marie and Kelsey twenty years ago? <br><br>Search Marie's room and join Kelsey in her trip down memory lane. Open drawers, pick up objects. Learn what Kelsey remembers, read what Marie thought about it. As you puzzle the pieces together, you uncover the secrets of their friendship. <br><br><i>&quot;She asked me why I was so angry all the time. And I told her -- because it’s a dirty deal. It’s Russian roulette and utterly unfair. The cards I’d been dealt, any player would have passed. I chose to be angry instead. But Marie, my friend Marie, she got me a new deck. And suggested that I deal again.&quot; - Kelsey</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The team behind the game</h2><br><strong>Creative Direction - Art &amp; Programming</strong><br>Kenny Guillaume<br><br><strong>Writing - Dialogue - Story</strong><br>Dagmar Blommaert<br><br><strong>Voice acting</strong><br>Lauren Hendler<br>Lauren Ann Higgins<br><br><strong>Music</strong><br>Dries Vienne<br>Simon Alexander<br><br><strong>Audio Mastering</strong><br>Ward Snauwaert",
