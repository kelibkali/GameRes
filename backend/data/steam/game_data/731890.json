Players are separated into two teams - The Hunted, and Props. After each round the teams are swapped to play the other faction.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >AS THE PROP</h2>The prop's job is to prevent the &quot;Hunted&quot; from finding the 4 codes to unlock the door and escape. Props may turn into almost anything from the environment, stealth, melee attack, throwing dagger, as well as night-vision (with changes / more to come). Blend in with your surroundings and wait for the time to strike. Hunt down the opposing team or prevent them from escaping to win the round.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >AS THE HUNTED</h2>The hunted's job is to collect the 4 codes to unlock the one key-padded door to escape and win the round. Equipped with an assault rifle with unlimited ammo, unlimited sprint, glow-sticks, traps, and a flashlight(with changes / more to come).
