No one expected an attack, but the enemy suddenly did just that nonetheless, and that adversary is very strong.<br><br>To ensure security, you must quickly build your defensive structures using machine guns, rocket launchers and even a flamethrower. Those complexes must be prepared for incoming ground and air attack, for multiple sides. You earn resources from killing enemies and can use that to upgrade your weapons.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/821910/extras/1d1648e843d993b02ed4484fba640f3f.avif?t=1564767003\" width=600 height=330 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>FEATURES :</strong></h2><br><strong>- Strategic gameplay.</strong><br><strong>- Upgradable weapons.</strong><br>- Multiple fronts of combat.<br>- Time-Bullet",
