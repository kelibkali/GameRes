    "description": "A long time ago people lived peacefully; they lived and died, they improved, explored, and discovered, but they wanted more.<br>They became greedy, they wanted to be kings and rule the world. <br>Unnecessary fights, murders, wars... Gods decided to stop this. <br>At the end of every year, during December, they opened gates to Hell so demons could freely punish, torture and kill. <br>The world began to become part of hell. People stopped fighting each other, they united, but that was not enough to defend themselves.<br>One demon was different, much stronger than everyone else, who once was a man, an assassin, who killed others to live, which in turn landed him in Hell.<br>But after some time in Hell, he had grown weary and regretted his past life and wanted to help the humans.<br>He became a guardian, and at the end of each year he fought off the demons.<br>The people called him Guardian of December.<br>The Devil noticed that his armies were being slain, so he offered a deal: no demon will ever come to Earth again, <br>but the Guardian of December must return to hell.<br>The people were saved and the guardian's soul was trapped in hell once again.<br>After a year, when the gates of Hell were opened again, the people were hoping that no demons would come out again... <br>But the Devil broke his deal and demons started crawling out...<br><br>The Guardian must return...<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/563910/extras/1ee1cd1744c2192c8a62abf1a9010112.avif?t=1744745218\" width=400 height=222 /></span><br><br>Gods give you the power to fight your way out of the hell prison and save the world.
