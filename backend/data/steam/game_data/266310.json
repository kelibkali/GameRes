    "description": "Welcome to GameGuru Classic, game making for everyone. We've created an easy to use and most enjoyable game creator. Join us and our great and enthusiastic game-making community on your journey to make fun games!  Imagine creating a world that you and your friends come together and play... and creating it can be a matter of minutes with no technical jiggery-pokery needed at all :-)  Of course, you can happily spend hours, days..even weeks creating your masterpiece, the great thing about GameGuru is, you won't be held up by learning strange alien languages or using complex modelling tools. The time you spend with GameGuru Classic is all about creating and having fun whilst doing it.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/266310/extras/4bde215fa88e18a17cc3e2b9c551f90a.avif?t=1749910805\" width=616 height=346 /></span><br><br>When you first launch GameGuru Classic, it may appear to be a simple level editor, but it's actually crammed with lots of useful tools you will need to make your own game, including a character creator, model importer, building maker, complete scripting language and of course, over 6GB of complimentary game assets to get you started. The fact it's as easy as any in-game level editor is a plus, and unlike level editors, you get to save out what you've made and even sell your game!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/266310/extras/bb73ed7bb397bc0c87ac1bb7ce11f6e4.avif?t=1749910805\" width=616 height=346 /></span><br><br>We've created a small game level for you to play and enjoy, which shows you how you might lay out your level, and balance the combat to give the player a challenging experience. You can, of course, edit this level any way you wish and learn from an existing demo level rather than start completely from scratch. We believe there is nothing on the market which enables you to create and share a 3D game as quickly as GameGuru Classic, thanks to a massive starter collection of assets, our easy drag and drop approach and built-in game logic so you don't need to code it yourself (unless you want to).<br><br>As a welcome bonus, we have also included an expansion pack with over 2.8 GB of additional game assets for you to get started, completely free! In fact, all the art you see in the screenshots above are included in GameGuru Classic and you are free to include them in your games, no strings attached.  We do sell additional content DLCs, but with over 6,000 megabytes of game assets already crammed into GameGuru Classic, the DLCs are entirely optional.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/266310/extras/d9b90d436fa125568829c1ef9218961e.avif?t=1749910805\" width=616 height=352 /></span><br><br><strong><u>GameGuru Classic and its creators</u></strong><br><br>GameGuru Classic has been developed by TheGameCreators.

GameGuru Classic is a recreational game maker, not a professional tool, and is still very much in development.  GameGuru Classic is unsuitable for serious game development projects at this time, and we highly recommend you visit the forums and ask many questions before you make a decision on the game making tool for you.",
