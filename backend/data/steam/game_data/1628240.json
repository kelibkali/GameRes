You’re in charge of it from now on. It’s not the easiest job in the world; you take responsibility for both the ships and the crew you have to recruit. However, if you pull it off, a door leading to enormous profits will open before you, allowing you to develop your harbor.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1628240/extras/e66fe48efc43bf5f3920a27d23e283b4.poster.avif?t=1733297863\" width=616 height=160 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1628240/extras/e66fe48efc43bf5f3920a27d23e283b4.webm?t=1733297863\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1628240/extras/e66fe48efc43bf5f3920a27d23e283b4.mp4?t=1733297863\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>To ease yourself into it, you will start with simple tasks. This way you’ll be able to upgrade your port and purchase new watercraft. You’ll also need a crew. Send your people on missions, and when the situation requires it, personally take the helm of the ship and face the vastness of the open sea.<br><br>Ships 22 features two game modes. In the first, strategic one, your role comes down to broad-based management: you give orders to your employees and you have the last word on the units – their repair, upgrades, and load. You also decide whether and when to start expanding the port in order to increase its capabilities and profitability.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1628240/extras/c3d9cba5389b4a67253c27d6a3393c03.poster.avif?t=1733297863\" width=616 height=160 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1628240/extras/c3d9cba5389b4a67253c27d6a3393c03.webm?t=1733297863\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1628240/extras/c3d9cba5389b4a67253c27d6a3393c03.mp4?t=1733297863\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>In the second mode, you’ll move from the managerial chair to the deck of the ship to personally lead the sea expedition. This is where Ships 22 changes from an economic strategy to an action/simulation game. Balancing between these two modes increases the immersion, diversifies the gameplay and doesn’t let you get bored.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1628240/extras/857ef06459e4d535d4d905f2b017f21f.poster.avif?t=1733297863\" width=616 height=160 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1628240/extras/857ef06459e4d535d4d905f2b017f21f.webm?t=1733297863\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1628240/extras/857ef06459e4d535d4d905f2b017f21f.mp4?t=1733297863\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>The game lets you manage a variety of ships.

The dynamics of the game is stimulated by the randomness of events, including changing weather. When you sail out to the sea, you never know what awaits you. <br>In addition, you also have a number of varied missions to complete, each of them different and determined by the type of the ship you’ll be managing. Every completed assignment brings you closer to the main goal of the game, i.e. the expansion of the port.
