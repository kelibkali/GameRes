It was made according to the rules of lost and forgotten systems and games. A game without the fancy graphics and system from todays games. A game you can sit down for and just play and enjoy. It can be hard it can be easy , it all depends on yourself.                                                <br><br>A labyrinth game based on the concept of the c64 game Druid. Simple graphics and simple game play which will keep you busy. A small but entertaining game. Find the keys and exit hidden in the labyrinths to proceed and try to stay alive while your playing. Old skool graphics and game play.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://i286.photobucket.com/albums/ll117/shortcircuit-nitros/wraith%20with%20lightning.png\" /></span><br>- Total of six levels of big labyrinths<br>- Bosses<br>- Monsters<br><br>NOTE : THIS IS NOT A TRIPLE A GAME - ITS JUST A SIMPLE CASUAL GAME - <br><br>The game was build from scratch with Game Maker Sudio over a period of two years.
