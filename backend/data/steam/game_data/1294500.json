    "description": "Undead Can Dance is a dancing battle game in virtual reality where you compete against other sorcerers in taking control of the dead through rhythm, power and accuracy.  Once an undead is in your possession, it will start dancing for you, sweating and jostling on the dancefloor while boosting your score. You can't dance? Just pretend!  It’s light-hearted yet intense and fun.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >ONLINE BATTLES</h2>Undead can Dance is built from the ground up to offer a tailored, solid and fun multiplayer experience along with a single-player mode. Never dance alone again.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >EASY BEATMAPS MAKER</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1294500/extras/3c473982895162da68f6a6caaf754391.poster.avif?t=1647540226\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1294500/extras/3c473982895162da68f6a6caaf754391.webm?t=1647540226\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1294500/extras/3c473982895162da68f6a6caaf754391.mp4?t=1647540226\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>The game ships with music, but it also works flawlessly with your own mp3. Adjust a couple of settings in the notes Detector, tweak the dancing style in the Choreographer, and you are ready to go.
