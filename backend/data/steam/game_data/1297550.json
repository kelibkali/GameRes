    "description": "<strong>Come face-to-face with a heavyweight champ!</strong><br><br>Too many boxing games place the player outside the ring looking in. How can you experience the adrenaline jolt of landing a crisp uppercut from the cheap seats?<br><br>Now you can literally “enter the ring” in the classic first-person boxing game TKO from Accolade™ – the boxing game that sticks you right on the canvas, staring straight into the eyes of a prize fighter bent on rearranging your face.<br><br><i>TKO</i>’s features make it a unanimous decision:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Split-screen, arcade-style boxing action gives you a dual, first-person perspective. Watch yourself hit and get hit.<br></li><li>Witness the punishment of the punches on each fighter’s face. They swell. They bruise. They turn black and blue.<br></li><li>Calibrate each boxer’s strengths. Is his left better than his right? Is he cat-like or a clubber? Does he run out of band-aids or run out of gas?<br></li><li>Fight a stable of hungry contenders, each with his own ringside manner.<br></li><li>Slug it out with large, animated fighters. Pick on somebody your own size.<br></li><li>One or two player capability: pummel friends or clobber the computer.<br></li><li>Aerial-cam shows your position in the ring.</li></ul>",
