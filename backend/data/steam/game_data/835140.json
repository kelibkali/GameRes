Participate in the development journey by downloading this free DLC that enables VR support for Oculus headsets. </h2><br><br>This updated alpha (Jun 24, 19) introduces 8 worlds to explore and was premiered in the Indie Megabooth's PAX East 2019 showcase! There's the retro Neon City, a beautiful Tron like CAD construct full of abstracted skyscrapers and doodle like forests. The bright Deconstructivist City, with towering shapes and labyrinthine alleys.  The Desert Canyon, a wonderful oasis whose ancient ruins defy gravity. The Tropic Island, rendered in a cacophony of primary colors. And 4 Edge worlds that truly bend the senses.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Controls:</h2></strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/835140/extras/6bce2aa486ddb73c355ee41eb6ce41cb.avif?t=1561433569\" width=609 height=268 /></span><br><br>Use the left joystick to move around the worlds, left index trigger to sprint and right index finger to jump.
