    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>A TRUE ROLEPLAY EXPERIENCE (RPMMO)</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >AEGIS Kingdoms is a living, breathing world built for roleplayers by veteran roleplayers. Every choice, action, and interaction unfolds through in-character storytelling, collaborative adventures, and player-driven narratives. Here, your character’s journey is defined by your decisions, alliances, and roleplay—not button mashing, zone grinding, dailies or anything like that. There are no traditional combat mechanics.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>GAME MASTERS AND DICE</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Game Masters (GMs) guide the world, narrate on behalf of NPCs, and oversee situations including combat. They lead monthly episodic events for players to participate in. Dice rolling is used to resolve outcomes in a fair and immersive way, ensuring your choices carry meaningful consequences in the story.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>EPISODIC CONTENT</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Content (from quests and adventures, to new monsters, mounts and more) is released episodically. These can range from time-limited journeys, to entirely new continents. Temporary political alliances, to major, terrain changing updates. The episodic release cycle allows for fresh, intriguing and new content available for both veteran and fresh characters.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>DEEP LORE, EASY TO LEARN</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >AEGIS Kingdoms is built in such a way that <strong>requires a minimal amount of lore for you to know before you login for the first time</strong>. We've created a &quot;getting started&quot; video to help you learn the important bits, as well as providing a wiki with literally everything else for viewing at your own pleasure. We are also active within the community to answer questions also.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >We encourage players to learn the lore as they go through roleplay. This reduces the opportunities for metagaming (accidental and purposeful), allowing you and your character to learn on the go. We believe this creates much more authentic and well-rounded characters, providing a more immersive experience for everyone.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>COMMUNITY AND SAFETY</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >There is <strong>absolutely no tolerance</strong> for toxicity, cliques, or unwanted behaviour. We've been there, done that, got the t-shirt. For too long this type of behaviour has plagued roleplaying environments, spoiling it for everyone. So we're taking a stand.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >AEGIS Kingdoms fosters a <strong>wholesome, creative, and supportive environment</strong>, encouraging collaboration, storytelling, and fun for all players. Our rules strictly prohibit toxic, clique behaviour, which will result in account termination if broken.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>ACCESS AND MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTIONS</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The game is free to download on Steam, but <strong>requires an affordable monthly subscription</strong> to participate. Account registration is <strong>manually approved</strong> by our staff to safeguard the community from disruptive players and ensure that every participant can enjoy a high-quality roleplay experience. Approval is required before a game account &amp; subscription can be purchased.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>NOTE</strong>: There are NO other types of &quot;micotransactions&quot; present in AEGIS Kingdoms. There is no premium currency, ability to buy land or characters (ever, never ever), lootboxes (ew) or anything like that. Your membership is part of supporting the game alongside everyone else who enjoys AEGIS Kingdoms.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>30 DAY FREE TRIAL</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Gain unfiltered access to AEGIS Kingdoms with a 30 day free trial. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A free trial allows you to play AEGIS Kingdoms without a paid subscription. It’s a non-restrictive way for you to test whether AEGIS Kingdoms is right for you, without having to pay any money.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >All features are available for ‘Free Trial Accounts’.

Likewise trial accounts are not treated any differently during events, sessions or the likes.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Once your trial expires, access to AEGIS Kingdoms will be restricted until a paid subscription is purchased.
