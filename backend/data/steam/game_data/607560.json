    "description": "<strong>VRCURATOR</strong> brings the wonder of &quot;co-presence&quot; to the VR environment. Now, the experienced VR user can “join” the new initiate in the experience. <strong>VRCURATOR</strong> allows you to speak directly to them in their headphones (using any configured microphone) while they remain completely immersed. You become a “spirit guide” and can modulate your voice in such a way that fits the experience, enhancing the joy and wonder of any VR title.<br><br>Every experience becomes enriched with co-presence, and vocal effects add to the fun!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Runs simultaneously with a VR game on any platform (Vive, Oculus, OSVR)<br></li><li>With headphones that support dual inputs (like the wireless Turtle Beach Stealth 450), you can even use this with the PlayStationVR!<br></li><li>Multiple vocal effects to enhance different VR gaming experiences:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>None</strong> (when you just want to curate someone's VR experience)<br></li><li><strong>Ghost</strong> (fun in many types of games!)<br></li><li><strong>Walkie Talkie</strong> (especially good with Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, or space games)<br></li><li><strong>Chipmunk</strong> (for added hilarity)<br></li><li><strong>Monster</strong> (you know what this is for)<br></li><li><strong>Bit</strong> (sci-fi goodness, especially fun with games like Bounce)</li></ul></li></ul><br>We have had a blast using <strong>VRCURATOR</strong> when introducing people to VR, or just joining another's experience for fun. There's a night-and day difference between using <strong>VRCURATOR</strong> and having to shout through someone's headphones, interrupting their experience and breaking the immersion. Now they can stay completely immersed while you guide them through the experience!<br><br>It's especially fun to join your friends in the VR goodness, turning every VR title into a local co-op experience! Because, using the &quot;Monster&quot; voice while your friend is in a horror game is just too fun to resist. ;-)",
