    "description": "The Signifier Soundtrack is a haunting plague of stilted tracks uniquely crafted to accentuate the games exploration of mind, death, experimental psychology, and artificial intelligence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeaturing a list of over twenty tracks as well as five extra instrumentals Playmestudio has crafted a soundtrack steeped in blended ambient chords, chilling tones and the undead laughs of ghostly children. As tech noir soundtracks go, this elevates the tension and adds a sense of urgency and foreboding in your quest to answer questions from beyond.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;23 (Extra) Radio 3&quot; is an interpretation from Rodrigo Mondaca of the &quot;Invention n8 in F major BWV 779&quot; from Bach.",
