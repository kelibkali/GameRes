The game also draws inspiration on the Vampire Chronicles of Anne Rice to name some elements (like the Armandia, Lestatia with the Théâtre and Louisian Villages) and contents of the plot. Nier Automata is present giving the concept of shooting companions (and sword dwelling characters), android models and dead body rescue.",
