No problem!</h2>If you don't have an existing library or you just don't feel like accumulating sounds from all over the web. We got you!<br>We're constantly <strong>creating new sound and audio packs specially designed to work seamlessly with RPG Sounds.</strong><br><br>That means that<strong> music and ambient sound loop seamlessly and each SFX comes with several iterations.</strong> It means that every time you play that Sword Slash SFX you get a new variation. <strong>That's pretty sweet,</strong> especially during combat when attacks and abilities are being used over and over.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1480140/extras/53048151b79403efcb802e13ee9e9edf.avif?t=1642614930\" width=600 height=261 /></span><br><br>We really think this is <strong>the best audio tool there is for Dungeon Masters </strong>(spoiler: it's not just for Dungeon Masters). <br><br>We are currently <strong>working on improving and adding new features to RPG Sounds</strong> on desktop and also <strong>developing mobile versions of it</strong> for tablets and phones.
