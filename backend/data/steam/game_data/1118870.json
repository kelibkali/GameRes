    "description": "Sort monsters.  Then battle them in the order you chose. Open chests for upgrades.  Finish the dungeon to gain powerful new swords, chestplates, and amulets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFind more maps to tougher dungeons.  Upgrade your character, combine old items to forge new ones, and finally defeat the Vampire Queen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat's it.  Sort Battle: Dungeon is simple and fun, the kind of game that you will play late into the night.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHi, I'm Thom Robertson, and I made Sort Battle: Dungeon because I thought that sorting was inherently fun, and I wanted to explore that fun within the context of<br />\r\na videogame.  Putting things in bins; sorting the cups in the cupboard; eating all the red jellybeans first.  These are sorting behaviors we all do, generally speaking.<br />\r\nI wanted to see if it was &quot;videogame&quot; fun, and I had a vision in my head of an array of monsters that the player could drag and sort.  So I built a prototype, and<br />\r\nmy first few testers were very pleased, so I proceeded to make this game.",
