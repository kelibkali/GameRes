Join Sue on her summer job processing packages with a high-tech tape gun.<br><br><strong>Risk-Reward Puzzle Action!</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Run, jump, and climb with responsive three-button controls. Tape up boxes by bumping into them, then stomp to clear 'em out!<br></li><li> Get combos by clearing multiple boxes at a time. Set up big combos by letting stacks pile up- just don't take too long to clear them...<br></li><li> Two gameplay variants: Go for big combos in <i>Standard</i>, and match numbered  cards with combos in <i>Challenge</i>!<br></li><li> Runs are quick! When a hazard brings your shift to a close, just dust yourself off and jump back in when you're ready.<br></li><li> Lots to do! Check your stats, set up a customized shift, chat with Sue's coworkers, and more.<br></li><li> This game is pretty tough, but don't sweat it! You can focus on improving your personal best, go for bragging rights, or just have fun! There's no set ending to Combo Postage, so please play as long as you'd like.
