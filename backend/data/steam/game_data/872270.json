    "description": "&quot;In this game you can't do whatever you want&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The change&quot; is not a game. I mean, it is an indie game which wants to set a thought in your mind and in which you will be bound to go only ahead. Look forward. This game is a third person. Without 2018 graphics, indeed, but which wants to impress by words. Listen to me and discover the message behind the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The change&quot; is more like a story. A story which needs to be understood.<br />\r\nWhen you'll buy this game, don't expect a very long gameplay, as this is my first game. I will grow along with my games.",
