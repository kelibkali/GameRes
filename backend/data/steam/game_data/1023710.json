    "description": "With the demands of the Digital Age upon us, it is no surprise that we are experiencing higher levels of stress in our bodies, mind, and nervous system. These stresses can deplete our energy and often leave us feeling “zapped” and worn out. Yet, ancient systems of mind/body medicine from Yogic, Tibetan and Chinese practices have incorporated the subtle art of chakras and meditation for thousands of years. Now, you can do it through virtual reality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWelcome to KameaVR. This virtual healing meditation experience will guide you into an introspective realm to teach you the seven major energy centers of the human body and how to replenish them. This visually pleasing, musically vibrant, and relaxing app will help to cleanse each of the seven chakras and help them resonate through vibrant colors, chants, symbols, and healing sound currents. The soothing voice will pull you into a deep, trance-like state of ultimate relaxation, while the experience will guide you to a world of inner beauty and calm.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith KameaVR you will learn about the true nature of chakras, which are each represented by a particular color, resonating sound, and symbol. The app also explains why it is important to bring them back into balance.  This healing experience aims to support and rediscover a balanced flow of energy throughout your entire body, and each twenty minute meditation will lead you on a journey towards self-improvement, insight, healing, and regeneration. This first version of KameaVR will focus upon the 6th chakra, or otherwise known as the &quot;third eye chakra.&quot; Updated versions of this application will allow you to dive deeper into each of the remaining chakras. Stay tuned and stay ready to bliss out. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nReach your highest self with KameaVR.  Adventurous spirit required.",
