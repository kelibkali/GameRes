Team work is the progress.<br>🏆 You both are the key to your success.<br> <br><strong>🏆 Daily Challenge:</strong><br><br>During the Daily Challenge you are both given 3 goals to achieve each day. After the end of the day, each partner gives a quick assessment on how well the other partner achieved those goals. You both then review the results and end the day. Merit points are given to your partner based upon how well they achieved those goals. Merit Badges are also earned as you gain Merit Points. Results and progress are carried on to the next day and throughout the Session. Each Session, you are given 3 new goals to achieve daily for 4 Sessions in total. Each assessment and review only takes a few minutes each day and is very simple to complete but highly effective. All progress can be saved and Session Coaching can be accessed to provide further details about your Daily Challenges.<br><br><strong>🏆 Session Assessment:</strong><br><br>At the end of 3 days of each daily challenge, you and your spouse will be given a Session Assessment. Each evaluation session is a few minutes. You and your partner each respond to a series of phrases through several response options. You then review each other’s responses and then conclude the session with discussions or silent reflection. Each private session can last 5-15 minutes. The complete couple's session can last from 30 minutes to an hour. Once the assessment is completed, a new Session is started with new Daily Challenges and goals. Affirmation, bonus rewards and commitment goals are added to encourage your progress.<br><br><strong>🏆 Time Involved:</strong><br><br>Assessments are simple but can grant amazing insight for both partners to reflect upon. You both can discuss the results or can opt to not discuss the results after they have been reviewed. The option to go over areas of concern is also available. No 3rd party is ever needed.<br><br><strong>🏆 Merits and Rewards:</strong><br><br>Merit Badges are earned through progress. Your partner’s assessment of your progress determines the points earned and the badges you receive. You also in turn determine your partner’s progress equally. Your perspective of your partner and your partner’s perspective of you is what matters most here, not the accuracy of the assessment. This is what is reflected over time and inspires motivation on both sides. Accountability can be automatic and helps to keep your progress honest and fair without any 3rd party intervention.<br><br>*Romance Coaching 101: Couple's Edition is not a therapist nor is it created by licensed therapists. Developed by a couple of over 20 years of marriage, Romance Coaching 101: Couple's Edition is a &quot;self help&quot; application designed to help guide couples into reflection, self development and cooperation. Progress and results are based upon each couple's willingness to work together. We make no claims or guarantees for any personal success or prevention of failure.",
