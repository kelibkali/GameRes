    "description": "This is a Demo of Antiprism made available exclusively for the Steam Game Festival in February 2021.<br><br>Antiprism is the world's first twin-ship VR shoot'em'up! Control one space ship in each hand as you go on a series of missions, fighting swarms of enemies and dodging dangerous projectiles and anomalies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >VR-only</h2>Antiprism has been designed from the ground up as a VR-only experience. <br>We're working to make the game comfortable to play in any room setup, whether seated, standing or room-scale. <br>Antiprism's unique gameplay only works in a VR setting with two controllers and can't be played with a game controller or mouse and keyboard.<br><br>The demo gives you a small glimpse into our vision. We have A LOT more stuff under construction!<br>Come to our Discord server or reach out on Twitter if you're interested in joining our community and playtesting our beta builds!",
