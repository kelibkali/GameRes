    "description": "Introduction<br />\r\nShotgun Raiders is a 2d fast action platform shooter. <br />\r\nInspired by the easy controls of classic mario, limited gun angles of the good old arcade shooters, and level crafting. <br />\r\nThis is a bloody 4 player local party game with file access to import your own characters, share created backgrounds &amp; levels. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures<br />\r\nTrading Cards!<br />\r\nPremade levels. <br />\r\nYou can choose (original levels or player created levels) <br />\r\n2-4 player battles or play against ai on easy medium or hard. <br />\r\nYou can create your own levels, even the 2 layers of parallaxing background! <br />\r\nAlso you can import your custom made characters! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay<br />\r\nYou can walljump, wallclimb with a pickaxe, and doublejump to quickly move around. <br />\r\nShotgun ammo &amp; grenades are infinite, battles are quickly won by those who master the easy controls. <br />\r\nGrenades can be cooked (hold button = grenade timer). <br />\r\nIf you have kills and you do a grenade suicide, a kill is substracted in the form of a large golden jewel. <br />\r\nThis jewel is thrown into the level and can be taken by any player giving them the kill you worked for! <br />\r\nSo cook those grenades :-) <br />\r\nThe gametypes are deathmatch and last man standing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nControls<br />\r\nRequires a gamepad or a arcade/fightstick to play<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExtra info<br />\r\nI have made this game so, that you can easy access your game files. <br />\r\nThis makes it possible for you to pack your levels/backgrounds/characters into a zip and send it to friends any way you like. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA special thanks to everyone who voted!",
