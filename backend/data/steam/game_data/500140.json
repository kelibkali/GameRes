    "description": "A virtual reality hunting game. Choose between shooting flying ducks in random patterns, hunting a deer or a boar in the open. Every score point you'll get the animals become harder to hit. It's a bit of a relaxing &quot;outdoors&quot; game with low poly graphics. Wildlife VR is perfect for first-time-vr-experience since it's not hard to jump straight into. Choose between three different weapons; Revolver, Shotgun or Sniper-rifle.",
