    "description": "Welcome to Dash Dash Delivery!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA 3rd person simulation anyone can enjoy!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game/Simulation was created by students attending the University of Texas at Arlington over a six month period.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat is the goal?<br />\r\nThe goal of this project was to teach financial literacy to middle school aged students on the autism spectrum.   This was accomplished by creating this simulation that allows the player to work as a delivery person at the nearby mall.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo what do you do?<br />\r\nYou play as a male or female delivery person making your way around the mall completing deliveries for various shops over a 7 in game days.  Completing deliveries will earn you money that can be spent in certain shops.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat else can I do?<br />\r\nWe are glad you asked...in Dash Dash Delivery you can explore the mall, buy items that can be used to customize your character, find some tasty treats, enjoy the scenery, and even win wonderful prizes in the arcade.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCan you find ALL the hidden Easter eggs?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n*Please note* - As this was a student project that has been completed, there is little chance for further development of this game...including bug fixes.  If you found a bug...awesome...you can let us know, but it probably wont be fixed.",
