    "description": "Retention is a puzzle/platformer that follows the story of Amy. Amy has seemingly lost her memories, and it is your job to help her remember who she is. Use your Focus to reveal what was once hidden, and guide Amy back to her one true love.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRetention is a game built by 20 some odd SCAD students that graduated in the 2020 year. The whole game was built in less than a year, and was put together using a completely voluntary workforce. Ever since the games conception, our team wanted to do more than produce a simple game. We always had a message and wanted to make a difference with our work. We give this game to the public for free in order to bring more awareness to Alzheimer's Disease and its victims. If this game touched you, or you enjoyed playing, please donate any money you would have put toward it to the National Alzheimer's Association.",
