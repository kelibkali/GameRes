The player must collect the balls and survive for 5 levels. Red balls give him rocket and green balls give him health.The show keeps on getting harder level by level. <br>Runners , Spiders , Mecha , turrets ,Human clones want to play with you.<br>Every level is a procedural construction and can be destruct a lot.<br>You can become a star of the show !<br>Controls are classical FPS keys.<br><br>&quot; <strong>In this game , i wanted the player have fun and fury in the same time.</strong>&quot;<br>BERNARD Nicolas , Developer",
