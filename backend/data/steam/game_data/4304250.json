Choose your squad from 12 eccentric misfits, and scavenge the ruins of a hypercapitalist dystopia. Can you escape a hostile planet that loathes your very existence?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This demo contains 2-3 hours of gameplay equal to 20% of the full game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4304250/extras/94b3ba5ab96530fdab1dd6cf086a2be3.avif?t=1772067932\" width=864 height=288 /></span></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Assemble your crew from 12 bizarre adventurers—each with unique field skills, combat abilities, and delightfully quirky personalities. There's a clown, a ninja, a neanderthal, a skeleton, a sentient Twinkie, and it only gets weirder from there.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Freely roam the sprawling ruins of Vacation Island, a post-apocalyptic paradise with over 400 screens to explore. Gain experience not just from battles, but from discovering forgotten places.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Arm yourself with the absurd leftovers of a decadent civilization: pool noodles, nail guns, rollerblades, x-ray glasses, and more. Each of the 200 items comes with its own stats and abilities.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Face off against a mutant menagerie: gun-toting mermaids, flesh-hungry flamingos, mushroom fairies, homicidal jello cakes—and much, much worse.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Survival is more than combat. Disarm traps, hack ATMs, forage for food, dig tunnels, and use your party’s field skills to outwit the island’s many dangers.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Discover lore by interacting with hundreds of strange landmarks. Every description and line of dialogue changes depending on who’s in your party.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >10-12 hours of exploring, battling, and resource management.
