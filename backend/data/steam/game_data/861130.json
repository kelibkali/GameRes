    "description": "Swapper Tiles is a first person puzzle game where you play as a robot trapped in a cage with only one way to escape. You must complete all challenges set by your captors. The challenges include complete puzzles by swapping them to create a path between them. The demo includes 2 of the levels that are needed to escape the cage. The full version includes all the levels needed to escape the cage as well as a level generator to creating your own levels. You can customise the colour of the three parts of the tiles: connector, center and the back. If you have any feedback, please email me so i can try to change the game to make it better.",
