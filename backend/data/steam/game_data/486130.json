Instead, they just pop up organically. That is the case here, Best Buds vs Bad Guys is a 2D run ’n’ gun from a game developer Dad and his 11 year old son, with a special message behind it. Richard and Lucas both have a love of classic pixel art games, and always wanted to develop a game of this genre together.<br><br>&quot;We call each other 'best bud', and really wanted to create a game together. We both love classic pixel art games; exploring and discovering cool stuff, shooting lots of nasties! So from there the concept was born, a game about teamwork, battling bad guys and using stupidly powerful weapons and power-ups to do it. A game about good over evil and about friendship, overcoming difficulties, and kicking bad-guy butt!&quot;<br><br>&quot;We wanted to create an authentic retro experience which draws upon Lucas' imaginative ideas for enemies and levels and my admiration &amp; love of classic 80s/early 90s arcade machine games like Contra, Ghosts ’n Goblins, Green Beret, Mega Man, Bionic Commando and more.&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >THE BAD GUYS</h2><br>We love themed enemies and themed levels; and this is on full display in Best Buds! Each enemy and boss has been lovingly crafted to have a distinct look, theme, and personality.<br>And we love variety and diversity too - so that's why we pixelated over 100 of them, Nasty!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/486130/extras/344af99a5df563c6c1784c69077d324a.avif?t=1658246471\" width=616 height=128 /></span>",
