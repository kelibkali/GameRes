    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A Pulse-Pounding Platformer in a Neon Fueled Dreamscape.</h2><br>Teknedia is a fast paced, <strong>first person platforming</strong> game where you dodge mines, leap over lasers, and race your way to finish! Jump your way through dozens of vibrant, neon-infused levels, and unlock the mysteries behind this alien world. With a built in leaderboard, compete against your friends and the players around the world to <i>see who's the fastest</i>!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Our Story</h2><br>We started this game back when we were in college, and (while it admittedly took us a <i>bit</i> longer to make this than it &quot;should&quot;) we're really happy it to show the world. It all started as a loose collection of what we as a team liked: simple yet hard platforming, lasers, electronic music, puzzles with many layers, and the Quake 3's map editor (ya, that's a weird one...). From there, it went from student project to startup project to a way to stay connected. <br><br>So, thanks for stopping by, and we hope you enjoy our odd, little game <strong>&lt;3</strong>",
