    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >INTRODUCTION</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Royal Space Force needs you! A malicious alien force known as EXODON has brought chaos upon the Cyan Galaxy. Outnumbered and outgunned, the Royal fleet doesn’t stand a chance in a head on shoot out with the invading armadas. Tactical precision is the only chance of success. You must bravely blast through the hordes and vanquish the enemy leaders in your single seat starfighter, symbolically dubbed the Titan. However, you won’t be all on your own. A small eclectic squad of wingmen will fight by your side, while the Starhulk space carrier provides a mobile base where you can upgrade your ship. In order to prevail you will need to evolve the Titan’s arsenal from a humble single shot cannon to a spread shot, laser shooting, rocket launching, bombastic one man army. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >GAMEPLAY</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Hyper Echelon takes inspiration from arcade classics while bringing its own authentic flavor of frantic, tactical shooting action - a bold experience with enough teeth for hardcore players, and plentiful rewards to welcome newcomers. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/953330/extras/35e7ff8abb76377ea0b6da3d7369881a.poster.avif?t=1765231177\" width=640 height=360 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/953330/extras/35e7ff8abb76377ea0b6da3d7369881a.webm?t=1765231177\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/953330/extras/35e7ff8abb76377ea0b6da3d7369881a.mp4?t=1765231177\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Missions</strong> - The core story mode takes you on an epic campaign across the galaxy featuring 10 distinct worlds. To advance you must do more than survive, you must earn medals by completing specific objectives. These objectives include destroying all enemy units, finding collectibles, and various specials tasks unique to each mission. Try to get them all in one shot for a top rank, or progress steadily by focusing on one objective per run. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/953330/extras/dc3862e0c80fefd30a1eb45c3e561f30.avif?t=1765231177\" width=534 height=186 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Wingmen</strong> - Bring a wingman into action to fight along your side. While managing two ships at once makes you a bigger target, the wingmen compensate by offering greater firepower, and extra special abilities. The most effective way to progress in the game is to achieve a harmonious relationship with your wingmen. 3 unique wingmen characters can be unlocked by playing missions. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/953330/extras/94c2b394e596ec322bbfbbdf62bfa5cf.avif?t=1765231177\" width=534 height=120 /></span><strong>Special Abilities</strong> - In addition to an array of standard projectiles, the Titan and wingmen have special abilities. These include offensive attacks, shields, and the ability to slow time.
