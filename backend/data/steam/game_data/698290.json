    "description": "Data Thief is still in development, and any demo content is not representative of the final product.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nData Thief is a VR puzzle game where the player's goal is to solve light puzzles by redirecting, splitting, and merging colored beams of light in order to reach and obtain a piece of data. The player is only able to view one primary color at a time, alongside secondary colors composed of that primary color. While the spectrum limitation does hinder the player's ability to see the full picture, it allows them to move without fear of coming in contact with the dangerous beams of concentrated light.",
