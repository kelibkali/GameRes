The borders between them were erased, and a unified form of government was established on the planet - corporatocracy, which put power over people in the hands of cold-blooded boards of directors of transnational companies.<br>The bloody war left a heavy mark on the body of mankind, creating millions of useless cripples, one of which is the hero of this visual short story.<br>In the post-war reality, people like him have no future. Nevertheless, he is given a unique chance - to start all over again in the experimental version of virtual reality full immersion.<br>Involuntarily, he becomes a participant in an ambitious experiment.
