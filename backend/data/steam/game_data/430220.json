    "description": "The AGC or 'Autorails de Grande Capacité' were designed by the Canadian manufacturer Bombardier. After delivery of the first of these railcars, SNCF and the regional councils served by TER (Transport Express Régional) were highly impressed with the design and quality of these trains. They were particularly impressed with the modular interior and flexible power choices, with diesel, electric and hybrid 'bi-mode' versions available. A particularly innovative version is the bi-mode, bi-current variant, nicknamed 'BiBi', which can run from diesel power, 1500v DC overhead and 25Kv AC overhead.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe version depicted here is a hybrid Diesel + 1500v DC version, in 'Languedoc' livery and is now available to add to your Trainz collection.",
