    "description": "Its really quite simple, you can play anywhere from 2D up to 6D, against anywhere from 2 players up to 6 players. Local and Online Vs are both supported, and there are plenty of settings to play with, from gravity to turn timers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay is pretty easy, if you are in 2 or 3D, then you just have a single board, right click to spin it around, double click to place a piece, and use the scroll wheel to look inside the board. When you move up to higher dimensions the whole board will be shown on the left side of the screen, you can select any individual segment of that board to expand it and show it on the right side of the screen, same placement and manipulation controls as lower dimensions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are still features and quality of life changes planned to be implemented by May 2021.",
