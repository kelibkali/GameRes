(&quot;Melosian sheep are famed for their genetically engineered Kevlar-like wool&quot; - <i>Melosian Tourist Board</i>).<br><br><strong>Melos</strong> has been invaded by the <strong>Archronites</strong>, a warmongering species fighting their way through the local galactic sector. The Archronites have started to colonise Melos to exploit its natural resources, driving the native population from their homes. When one day you discover they have even invaded your tiny home island, you are forced to act.<br><br><strong>Together with your trusty navigation droid, DFX-9T,</strong> and after an enemy pilot had <i>apparently met an unfortunate fate on the rocks,</i> you commandeer their vessel and take to the skies in the fight back against the alien colonists. One by one, you must capture their airbases and destroy the infrastructure they are putting in place.<br><br><strong>Beware</strong>, however, <strong>Archronite Commander Veilos</strong> will be out to stop you! You will come up against his forces in Arc Vectors - a devastatingly powerful attack ship, and Arc Fighters - a stealth-like fighter aircraft, Drones, Plasma Tanks and Laser Tanks and numerous other defences. Fortunately, the ship you have stolen is also an Arc Vector!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1149500/extras/9fbd7109f94cbccef7d4b4aaaa130091.avif?t=1763089180\" width=616 height=120 /></span>",
