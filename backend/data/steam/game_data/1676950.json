Realistic, deadly, awe-inspiring - can you tame it? The key to completing missions will not be time but tactics. It's not enough to pour water everywhere in the hope of extinguishing the fire.

You are rescuing the occupants: using a ladder truck or an inflatable cushion. Extinguishing the burning apartment from the fire truck's ladder in front of the building will put out the fire but will not complete the mission until the firefighters have checked if the fire has entered the shafts with pipes and electrical cables. There the fire can smolder for some time and can spread to another floor. Therefore, a thorough inspection of the shafts and extinguishing with handheld fire extinguishers will complete the mission.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1676950/extras/426e225e42538f9da902c1497eedf9f0.poster.avif?t=1747080039\" width=600 height=248 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1676950/extras/426e225e42538f9da902c1497eedf9f0.webm?t=1747080039\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1676950/extras/426e225e42538f9da902c1497eedf9f0.mp4?t=1747080039\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Too much water is used to extinguish a facility that floods the power distribution panel in the basement of this building. A massive electrical short occurs, knocking out power to the entire neighborhood. The outrage of the residents and the city government does not bring glory by cutting financial support, thus allocating additional equipment necessary for the next mission.<br><br><strong>Consultation</strong><br>To add gravitas, we would like to get a consultant from the Fire School to present the realities of the profession, with individual missions mirroring actual firefighting operations that, for some reason, were very difficult even for experienced firefighters. Perhaps the consultation will be at no cost when the School decides that our game can be an exciting addition to education and even become a mandatory trainer.",
