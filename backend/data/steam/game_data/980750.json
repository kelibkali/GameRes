    "description": "The reindeers are waiting and the present are already packed... nearly time to go! But there's so many presents and so little time!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHelp the Santa by finding the correct presents and packing them to the respective sledges. Santa's Workshop is a semi-hidden object game, developing attention skills and memory. Like in every normal HO you have a list of objects to find and a map with those objects located. But things are quite dynamic in a workshop, so the presents keep moving around, sometimes disappearing behind decorations. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are 3 maps available to search through and over 50 different presents to find.",
