    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>WELCOME TO THE EXPERIMENT</strong></h2><br>In <strong>Quantumleaper</strong>, you’ll use your Superposition ability to face puzzles that would be otherwise impossible to solve.<br><br><strong>Duplicate your position</strong> with a single button and press it again to switch between your two selves at any time, no matter how far. You can use your other self to activate switches, mislead enemies and block projectiles. Sometimes, even tunnel through walls!<br><br>As you progress, new components will require you to find new ways to advance – using both intelligence and skill. You will also find the Strands, a new type of equipable item introduced in the <strong>Strand of Divisions</strong> update. They will expand your combat options with new attacks, stat boosts, evasive maneuvers, healing abilities and much more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Superposition:</strong> a simple, yet powerful new mechanic that provides a fresh take both on the 2D action and the puzzle-platformer formula;<br></li><li><strong>20 levels</strong> with varied puzzle elements and enemies;<br></li><li><strong>Over 30 unique Strands</strong> with distinct effects hidden thoughout the game, many of which are in <strong>Entangled Chests</strong>: opening one of them will define the contents of a different chest elsewhere. You will never stumble upon a Strand you already own;<br></li><li><strong>Upgradable skills:</strong> defeat enemies to collect wire segments that can be later used to upgrade Strands, allowing you to refine your favorite battle strategies even further;<br></li><li><strong>Powerful bosses</strong> that control different quantum fields - the forces of nature themselves;<br></li><li><strong>A story about the search for answers</strong> with a protagonist that doesn't accept handwaves and cares for for knowledge as much as he cares for his own freedom.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS</strong></h2><br>This is the start of a big adventure. Keep in mind, once you enter the experiment, no one can help you out. Danger lies even among the possibilities opened by the Strands as one of them - Lovelace - holds an unsettling amount of knowledge, bringing you closer to death each time it speaks...<br><br>With no exit in sight, exploring and understanding this place is the only option left. But those in the path of truth and logic won't falter. Science prevails.",
