    "description": "<strong>Strategic Command WWII: War in Europe is a deeply immersive turn based strategy game covering the greatest conflict in modern history.</strong><br> <br>Take control over either the Axis or the Allies, while directing the efforts of each nation belonging to your alliance.  From this unique perspective, you will be the supreme mastermind behind the entire conduct of operations, deciding the priorities, the strategies, and coordinating your global efforts to win the war!<br>Each nation in your coalition will have their own strengths and weaknesses, levels of technology, troops, equipment, and industrial capacity, and it will be up to you to make the best use of all of them!<br><br><strong>Wage war across land, sea and air,</strong> employing a wide range of historical units combined with multiple avenues of technological upgrades.  With research and development, the demands of combat and limited resources, balancing the day to day requirements of the war against your long term strategy will all be critical to ultimate success and victory.<br><br><strong>Diplomacy and espionage</strong> will also be key tools to employ against your enemy as a war like this cannot be fought solely with military forces.
