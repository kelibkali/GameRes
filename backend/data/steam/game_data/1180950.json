    "description": "This pack contains 7 visuals based on oscilloscopes and spectrums.<br><br>The visuals are the following:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Space Spectrum</strong>: (by community member <strong>Noodles</strong>) is a mix of circular spectrum analyzer, a specially designed star field and a particle beam in the middle.<br></li><li><strong>3D Oscilloscope</strong>: Multiple oscilloscope rings forming a cool 3D shape. <br></li><li><strong>Polar Bar Eclipse</strong>: The sound wave expressed as colored bars. For higher frequencies there is an &quot;ear&quot; outside which contrasts very well with the base effect.<br></li><li><strong>Polar Spectrum Analyzer</strong>: Dual slowly rotating circular spectrum analyzers.<br></li><li><strong>Polar Oscilloscope Wave</strong>: A circular wave being drawn into, almost like water. <br></li><li><strong>Spectrum Analyzer</strong>: 2-colored spectrum analyzer with cross-colored dots on top.<br></li><li><strong>Bare Polar Oscilloscope</strong>: Just the polar oscilloscope. Is cool on its own but perhaps more useful if you want to record it and use it in a video or as a layer in a streaming setup.</li></ul>",
