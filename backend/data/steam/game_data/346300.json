    "description": "A top-secret military research facility has gone dark.  Their last communication only had two words in it: “Containment Protocol”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour task is to infiltrate the facility using a prototype remote control drone and work out what has happened to the facility and more importantly - what has happened to the weapon they were working on.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHIS IS AN EARLY ACCESS GAME!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis means that it's not the full game, in fact the version that is currently uploaded is about 80% of what was available to play at Rezzed and on my Website. A large section of it has been re-designed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can play using WSAD or cursor keys to move around or even a JoyPad. Make sure the joypad is attached before you start the game as there is a bug where it won't be recognised if you plug it in after starting the game.",
