    "description": "<strong>A pure terror with a twisted backstory; jumping straight into the horrors surrounding Suite 776.</strong><br><br>Suite 776 focuses on an intense environment or pure suspense, horror, and mystery. It was my intention when developing this game to keep the player on edge throughout the whole ride while immersing the player in all sorts of mystery, story, and curiosity.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1197370/extras/99b8db30d03090145ec7fc1e0fceffdd.avif?t=1603044786\" width=540 height=270 /></span><br><br><strong><u>Story</u></strong><br>Marcy was a famous, well known architect. She was fond of her work and took great pride in what she did. However, she had an odd side to herself. Marcy wasn’t one to take criticism very well, so she tried a to cope with it by ringing her bell. Every time she rang her bell would signify criticism which made her very, very mad. It became especially bad after she completed designing and constructing her new home, formally known as Suite 776. The design was odd, confusing, and unpractical – Marcy’s greatest creation, according to her. In the end, she hung herself, hanging inside Suite 776… lifeless.<br>It is your intention to prove that the myths revolving around Suite 776 are true and to photograph Marcy in motion, as it is assumed that she lurks the hallways and terrorizes anybody willing enough to ring her bell… To criticize her. <br>How many times will you ring the bell?<br><br>Suite 776 is a short horror game with an estimated single completion time of ~50 min. As such,<strong> Suite 776 has NO SAVE FUNCTIONALITY and must be completed in a SINGLE SITTING. </strong><br><br>Suite 776 includes 3 endings coupled with all sorts of achievements, puzzles, and mysteries to solve.<br><br><br><strong><u>Developer’s note:</u></strong><br>Suite 776 was a phenomenal game to build! When I first began developing games back in 2014, I never thought I would be able to build something to the extent of Suite 776. Throughout all these years of self-taught developing, I have gathered all sorts of knowledge, experience, and advice from all of my fans, friends, and supporters! To that, I am very happy to present to you all Suite 776, and I genuinely hope you all enjoy it.<br><br>It is my hope, depending on the success of this game, to develop additional updates to Suite 776 including VR support. I have always wanted to delve into the depths of VR, and I believe Suite 776 will be a wonderful place to start. We will see!<br><br>Thank you again to everyone who has followed me since day one! I will continue to learn, expand, and provide an even better game year-round!<br><br>Happy gaming, everybody!<br><br>Stan.T<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1197370/extras/8c43492798e9f54c7369743c05be0150.avif?t=1603044786\" width=640 height=360 /></span>",
