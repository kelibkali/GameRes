    "description": "Game One of the iDGi-1 Trilogy. <br><br>A murder mystery, on a plane, in the future.<br><br>CONSORTIUM is an interactive narrative experience, first and foremost.   <br><br>The story begins in our world - the &quot;real world&quot; - where we here at Interdimensional Games have developed a satellite (iDGi-1) capable of opening a digital rift through time and space.  Anyone with an internet connection can travel through this rift and awaken within an alternate dimension from our own - the &quot;game world&quot; - in the year 2042. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The first of a planned trilogy, CONSORTIUM contains a fully resolvable arc entirely aboard Zenlil, it plays like a &quot;bottle episode&quot; of Star Trek with you being part of the cast.<br></li><li>Immerse yourself in an interactive story taking place entirely aboard the C-3800-D &quot;ZENLIL&quot; Consortium Command vessel on December 21st, 2042...<br></li><li>Built with a modified version of the SOURCE engine, explore ZENLIL, a living and highly interactive environment with complete freedom and agency.  Includes turbulence and non-scripted decompression events! <br></li><li>Engage with a cast of over 20 people in innovative and life like conversation.

Or play diplomacy with a smoking barrel, and let the tragedies continue to mount. <br></li><li>Dive into a world with well over 150,000 words of back-story and lore, where everything you read, see, speak, or hear relates to the story and characters, and everything is there for a reason.<br></li><li>A highly original energy based inventory system with original sci-fi weapons, gadgets and armor. <br></li><li>The story unfolds based largely on your actions.
