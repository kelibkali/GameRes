You'll find that your old theater festival, the John Q. Public Festival, has fallen upon hard times (but honestly, when has it not?). It's not easy being Lake Tahoe's second-best Shakespeare festival. It falls to you to write a new future for the festival, as well as either mend or break your relations with the people that you left behind.<br><br>Or at least that's the story you're trying to tell. You ARE a writer, but the &quot;hometown&quot; is a play you wrote long ago and the &quot;mean old world&quot;.... well, no, that's the mean old world. That's not a stand-in for anything. <br><br>As Joe Papp's author, you find yourself with the ability to change the story that you are in, making choices between multiple characters that ultimately dictate how the story progresses. Will you save the theater festival, or will you cause the zombie apocalypse?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/947080/extras/2509bb0ceabc9738e1faed67d151b374.avif?t=1663122665\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Write new paths to go down with (almost) every new scene<br></li><li> Your choices have effects on how every character views you<br></li><li> Make decisions that will affect your play's rating with the critics</li></ul>",
