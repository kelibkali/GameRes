    "description": "Puzzle Galaxies is a groundbreaking puzzle video game similar to games like Bejeweled and Candy Crush. You must match jewels stored in a space station in a manner similar to Bejeweled, but there's a twist - there are enemies that will come by and try to take matching jewels on you! Racing against the clock, and against the enemies, you must match the jewels in each of the pods of the space station before time runs out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlong the way, the player comes across many different bonuses, and obstacles, including:<br />\r\n- 5 different enemy ships<br />\r\n- 'bonus' pods<br />\r\n- a locked 'safe' that must be unlocked in order to beat the level<br />\r\n- 68 levels of fun!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso note that Puzzle Galaxies also features an unlimited time mode as well.<br />\r\nTry and see if you can get a high score by making as few moves as possible!",
