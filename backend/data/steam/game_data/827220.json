    "description": "For eternity The Keeper has used the power of The Eternal Sands to preserve the chronological order and ensure time is allowed to flow freely, but after countless epochs Greenwich the Mean Time-Witch has grown weary of merely keeping the infinite history of creation. She's stolen The Eternal Sands and used its power to construct a clockwork army that now threatens to destroy time itself.<br><br><i><strong>Overclocked: The Aclockalypse</strong></i> is a roguelike bullet hell following The Keeper’s time-twisting battle to reclaim The Eternal Sands from Greenwich and her clockwork army. Use The Keeper's ability to slow time to weave through impossible waves of cogs; then blast them with timesand to <strong>tock</strong> some sense into those <strong>tick</strong>ed off timepieces. Can you push far enough through the 4th Dimension's ever changing floors to defeat Greenwich and reclaim The Eternal Sands?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Procedurally generated dungeon floors that ensure each playthrough is unique<br></li><li>Intense boss battles to challenge your control of time<br></li><li>Several enemy types with over tons of possible attack behaviors<br></li><li>An arsenal of time-twisting abilities</li></ul>",
