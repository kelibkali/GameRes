    "description": "K'NOSSOS is a cold surreal adventure game about a man traveling the unknown reaches of the cosmos and the things he uncovers on his journey. Gameplay of K'NOSSOS is reminiscent of the point-and-click adventure game classics such as The Dig, Beneath a Steal Sky or Chronomaster, as well as the more recent titles such <br />\r\nas Primordia. The game puts equal emphasis on characterization, atmosphere and storytelling on the one hand, and problem solving and challenging puzzles on the other. K'NOSSOS is developed with PC version being the main objective of the team at this point. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nK’NOSSOS features: <br />\r\n•\t• classic point-and-click interface, <br />\r\n•\t• abstract 2D expressionist style reminiscent of the art of Wassily Kandinsky, <br />\r\n•\t• intricate dark sci fi storyline, <br />\r\n•\t• non-linear gameplay, and <br />\r\n•\t• cross-genre experimental soundtrack.",
