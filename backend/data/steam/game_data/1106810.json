    "description": "Pirates of the Asteroid Belt is a sci-fi story-driven role-playing action game. The story is set in 2273 somewhere within the Solar System. You’re neither a War Hero nor the Savior of the Humanity, but a captain of a small cargo ship. To travel across the Solar System is just a job for you. Unfortunately, cargo transport in the Main asteroid belt still remains not only loss-making business, but it is also a dangerous one.<br><br>This isn’t going to be a routine trip for you this time. You'll have to solve puzzles, deal with friendly inhabitants, and fight enemies to escape a space station captured by pirates.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Advanced system of interaction with non-player characters. Characters behave as real humans: they react to what you say and what you do.<br></li><li>Interactive environment. You can interact with plenty of objects, including locks, consoles, tablets, tools, etc.<br></li><li>Many types of weapon and tools to upgrade.<br></li><li>Combat requires not only dexterity and rapidity, but also tactical skills.<br></li><li>Your decisions will affect the course of events and the future of the characters.
