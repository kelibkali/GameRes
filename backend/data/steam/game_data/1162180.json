    "description": "Warren the Warlock is a 2D platformer in which you jump, throw, flip, phase, and dash your way through enemy filled levels to progress. Your ultimate goal is to find and defeat the leader of the unwelcome guests who have found their way into your homeland. Ridding your home of these intruders will not be an easy task, but as a warlock, you have a few tools at your disposal to help you along the way:<br><br><strong>Magic Orb:</strong> Hurl your dark magic orb at enemies. Be careful though, not all enemies are affected by your magic.<br><br><strong>Invert Gravity:</strong>  Keep an eye out for areas with a special shimmer in the air. When you find one, you can reverse gravity for yourself to find new and creative ways forward.<br><br><strong>Phase Shift:</strong> Become intangible to certain materials. This allows you to walk through certain walls, floors, objects, etc.<br><br><strong>Dash:</strong> Gain an instant burst of speed, allowing you to speed past obstacles and break through weak walls.<br><br>With the use of these magical abilities and a few other items you will find along your way, you are fully prepared to face the challenges ahead… or are you?",
