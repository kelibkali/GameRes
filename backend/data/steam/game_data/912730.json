    "description": "Gamble of Gods is an Isometric Shooter with exploration, puzzles and a cartoon<br />\r\naesthetic whose strong point is the frantic action and an immersive and funny<br />\r\nnarrative. The player will use the different abilities granted by the gods<br />\r\nto make his way between enemies, and make it<br />\r\nthrough the various traps and puzzles that comprise the pyramid.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach year, while the mortal world is oblivious to it, the gods of ancient<br />\r\ncivilizations celebrate a reality show in which a champion, chosen at random<br />\r\nfrom among humans, must pass a series of tests without even being aware of<br />\r\nparticipating in a Divine Reality Show.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeter Buttinson, an insignificant security guard, frustrated with his work at the<br />\r\nNatural History Museum in London, has been awarded the golden ticket in a box of<br />\r\ncereals, and the prize is to visit the Great Pyramid of Egypt.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUpon reaching the pyramid he discovers Anubis and Bastet, in charge of organizing<br />\r\nthe tournament. They present him with the challenge of crossing the pyramid and<br />\r\nreaching the deepest part of it, and in return, they will grant him the wish he wants.<br />\r\nWithout informing him that he is really going to be a simple puppet in the scheme<br />\r\nthey have set up. Peter, who dreams of being a true adventurer, accepts the challenge<br />\r\nwithout hesitation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough the two gods had worked out this plan together, they disagreed on only one<br />\r\nthing: Bastet believed that it was perfectly possible for a human to succeed in<br />\r\ncrossing the entire pyramid, while Anubis believed otherwise. So, Bastet will help<br />\r\nPeter by giving him a powerful bracelet that he can use to invoke some of the powers<br />\r\nof the goddess. On the contrary, Anubis will try by all means to prevent Peter from<br />\r\nsuccessfully completing the tests and leaving the Great Pyramid.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWill he be able to reach a place on the podium of heroes?",
