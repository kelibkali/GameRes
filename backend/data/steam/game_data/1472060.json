It is a <strong>multiplayer choose-your-own adventure RPG</strong> mixed with a <strong>roguelike strategy board game</strong> and hidden deckbuilder elements.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1472060/extras/91d13f14a41cae04fc7d4a37a5c9f8ed.avif?t=1738923476\" width=599 height=136 /></span><br><br>In this 40+ hour game, you will:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Use obsidian tokens upon the Apollyic table to control the powers of the world. Moving them upon the table influences what spirits can approach your table, which abilities you can use, as well as aiding or harming every challenge before you! <br><br></li><li>Deal with three spiritual entities every round. These might be creatures of other worlds, other occult practitioners, visions of the beyond, or many, many more! They must be dealt with through violence, invocation, treaties, deception, or the like.<br><br></li><li>Make difficult decisions that will change the narrative, both in small arcs and large stories for character and table alike. Your <strong><u>choices will matter</u></strong>, for better or worse!<br><br></li><li>Invoke spirits of your own. You may bring some of these spirits between rituals as <strong><u>permanent unlocks</u></strong>, known as Invocations.  You may also bring a <strong><u>small charm</u></strong> into every ritual, such as the Silver Timepiece to keep yourself sane while projecting into the spirit world.<br><br></li><li>Play Apollyon with <strong><u>up to two friends</u></strong>, who will share the table's alignment and take on every spirit together! This creates a unique strategy only present in <strong><u>multiplayer</u></strong>. For example, your efforts to escape a hostile fire spirit might be led by the player with more <strong><u>Agility</u></strong>, or the player who has a <strong><u>Guard</u></strong> on their physical statistics, in case they fail and take damage!<br><br></li><li>Unlock and play the <u><strong>ten playable characters</strong></u>, and progress their stories alone or in multiplayer! Gaining power through these skills and abilities will help you complete later missions, known as Intentions.<br></li></ul><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1472060/extras/d9cdf151301d3f69837ad2d122ca2913.avif?t=1738923476\" width=599 height=136 /></span><br><br>In the world of Sartova this practice is used to evoke angelic beings, gods, and other intelligences related to souls, elements, the Themes, night terrors, disembodied voices, and even things older than the gods themselves...
