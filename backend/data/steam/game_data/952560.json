For those that have wishlisted and waited all this time, <strong>thank you for your continued support</strong>! The game turned out to be far more than &quot;80+ puzzle-filled floors,&quot; in fact it is closer to 160 total levels. Sorry it took so long....and sorry it might be one of the most difficult games out there.... if someone out there actually beats this game, I would like to hear from you...you'll know how to reach me.</p>",
