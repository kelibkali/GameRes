    "description": "You believed tower defense is only about building towers? That's not quite right – because AIRA VR is not like other tower defense games in virtual reality. Once the battle starts you find yourself in the midst of the fight! AIRA VR merges the strategic elements of the tower defense genre and the thrilling action of a first person shooter in an intelligent manner and combines the best of both worlds. Thereby, AIRA VR is the first game of its kind that is exclusively developed for VR and offers you an unprecedented gaming experience.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1003230/extras/071b97151f0551a641fde6a24acecc88.poster.avif?t=1740002967\" width=600 height=216 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1003230/extras/071b97151f0551a641fde6a24acecc88.webm?t=1740002967\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1003230/extras/071b97151f0551a641fde6a24acecc88.mp4?t=1740002967\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>The game consists of two phases.
