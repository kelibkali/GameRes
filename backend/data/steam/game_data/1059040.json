When playing in clear conditions its easy to target and spot other players and combat is clear and open. When playing in rainy or snowy conditions however, there are winds howling and particles that fill the air. These elements make visibility a challenge. <br><br>Games can be played in daytime or at night time. In day time there is naturally a lot of light, making warfare open and frontal. At night time a more stealthy approach is often needed as visibility is low and enemies can be hard to spot. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059040/extras/cf21eb978f78957326f31f8075c9e7ff.webp?t=1703014611\" width=600 height=28 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059040/extras/21c0526024e4381902afef9750d15b5c.avif?t=1703014611\" width=600 height=150 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059040/extras/cf21eb978f78957326f31f8075c9e7ff.webp?t=1703014611\" width=600 height=28 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059040/extras/3d2730ac970cf4b5f00532b50051f222.webp?t=1703014611\" width=600 height=28 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059040/extras/cf21eb978f78957326f31f8075c9e7ff.webp?t=1703014611\" width=600 height=28 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059040/extras/d29df43094c22ab4fab075d987208a02.poster.avif?t=1703014611\" width=600 height=332 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059040/extras/d29df43094c22ab4fab075d987208a02.webm?t=1703014611\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059040/extras/d29df43094c22ab4fab075d987208a02.mp4?t=1703014611\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059040/extras/cf21eb978f78957326f31f8075c9e7ff.webp?t=1703014611\" width=600 height=28 /></span><br><br>With over 55 weapons to choose from there is a massive arsenal to select and play with.

There are 6 classes to choose from, each with a unique active and passive ability. The active ability gives the player an item or asset that they can use to turn the tide of the battle. The passive ability gives the player a unique buff that only that class enables. <br><br>As an example of the active and passive abilities lets look at the Avian class. The active ability for this class is a landmine that can be placed, so as to set a trap for an enemy. The passive ability for this class is a parachute, which ensures that this class doesn't take fall damage. Each class has unique abilities like these.<br><br>Classes can be selected regardless of the selected character or team. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059040/extras/cf21eb978f78957326f31f8075c9e7ff.webp?t=1703014611\" width=600 height=28 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059040/extras/8fc74da4b42dda36e176ced6b2d3c9aa.avif?t=1703014611\" width=600 height=150 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059040/extras/cf21eb978f78957326f31f8075c9e7ff.webp?t=1703014611\" width=600 height=28 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059040/extras/028e799b76b26fcca78a9f7690b0377b.webp?t=1703014611\" width=600 height=28 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059040/extras/cf21eb978f78957326f31f8075c9e7ff.webp?t=1703014611\" width=600 height=28 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059040/extras/c21e9afeebf915b215781b2d8086c88f.poster.avif?t=1703014611\" width=600 height=332 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059040/extras/c21e9afeebf915b215781b2d8086c88f.webm?t=1703014611\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059040/extras/c21e9afeebf915b215781b2d8086c88f.mp4?t=1703014611\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059040/extras/cf21eb978f78957326f31f8075c9e7ff.webp?t=1703014611\" width=600 height=28 /></span><br><br>Travel all around the locations of history with 16 true to life world war one maps to play in.
