    "description": "In Parkour Posse, two players take turns as the “runner” and “on-deck” moving through a level. When the 1st player reaches the end of a level, they switches places so the 2nd player can make the return trip. The runner will control the onscreen character moving, jumping, and dodging their way across the level. The player on-deck will be responsible for controlling the camera so the runner gets a better view, and providing helpful boosts when the runner needs them most.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1666800/extras/09e0a644cd962299b960a3fa0e0bc2f9.avif?t=1707368381\" width=600 height=338 /></span><br><br>The level doesn’t reset between runs, so anything the 1st player does in the level can potentially affect the 2nd. Level completion times are cumulative, so it’s important to work together to achieve the fastest times! Work together to run, jump, and dodge your way through 20 levels in theme park of a lifetime!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1666800/extras/d6c4706d9bb572964a5f1cce44868a16.avif?t=1707368381\" width=600 height=336 /></span>",
