    "description": "Call of the Ocean is a VR exploration game set in and around the ocean, with a variety of ocean creatures and locations to discover.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSet mainly in an island lagoon filled with ancient Greek temples and artefacts, the game integrates motion controls for full freedom of movement including swimming, climbing, running and jumping.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is in Early Access, but the motion controls, locations and creatures are in a playable state. You can explore ancient temples and shipwrecks, admire the beautiful wildlife, swim and play with dolphins. Grab hold and tag along for a ride on a turtle or whale. Cage dive with sharks - or better yet, dare your family and friends to go out of the cage and swim with them!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther game maps and features are in development, to be included into the existing game.",
