Survival games are generally open-ended with no set goals and are often closely related to the survival horror genre, in which the player must survive within a supernatural setting, such as a zombie apocalypse. ZKILLER is developed via the Unity3D game engine. The game features an advancement system, full-detailed environments and unlockable weapon and levels.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/894920/extras/226a49e26186748ea58a4705b0326f8c.avif?t=1602260469\" width=600 height=293 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/894920/extras/710fab02beea418049f98272ec8f83e0.avif?t=1602260469\" width=600 height=101 /></span><br>ZKILLER gameplay includes of player fighting through waves against horde of zombies. As waves pass, the enemy count will surge and different types of zombie are spawned with the final wave ending up in a boss fight. Player is equipped with four different weapon slots to be supplied with melee weapons, hand guns, assault rifles, shotguns, light machine guns and grenades. Random ammo, and health packs can be found by exploring the map, though player has a limited amount of weight to carry. The player loses health when hit by zombies or by certain environmental hazards (i.e. explosions).<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/894920/extras/81cd96753739c3b92fb1c3f4cdfbe0cd.avif?t=1602260469\" width=600 height=338 /></span><br>When players kills a zombie, they earn in-game experience points and money according to head shot, combo and melee kills. Zombie killer levels up when a sufficient amount of experience is obtained. The levels can be used to unlock maps and to buy different types of armory. To purchase a weapon, the player should reach to a certain level and gather enough money. Achieving more head-shot kills may cause the game to enter an advanced slow motion time, a few seconds where all game actions for players and all zombies are slowed down, which for player can be used to carefully target their next shot or start a different procedure of action.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/894920/extras/9e7a66a49e09d2d517d2f146d502d8fa.poster.avif?t=1602260469\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/894920/extras/9e7a66a49e09d2d517d2f146d502d8fa.webm?t=1602260469\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/894920/extras/9e7a66a49e09d2d517d2f146d502d8fa.mp4?t=1602260469\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/894920/extras/db6e486ea5c9592dc25d58015fb48beb.avif?t=1602260469\" width=600 height=101 /></span><br>In 2020, a menacing conflict happened between the nations around the world, so every politician was thinking about Biological warfare.
