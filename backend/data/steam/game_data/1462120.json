Although most of the cat army is made up of unqualified grunts clinging to the impossible dream of obtaining a lucrative job with benefits, there are also some skilled fighters among their ranks who will stop at nothing to fulfill their duty and take over the land. However, these cats aren't the only ones with a bachelor's degree in kicking butt - the local resistance won't give up their land so easily.",
