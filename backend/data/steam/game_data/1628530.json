    "description": "Survive the ever increasing pressure of time for as long as you can!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIncrelution is a minimalistic idle game about time management that takes inspiration from roguelite games. It's up to you to survive as long as you can with the tools that you unlock throughout life, such as food or constructions. As time goes on, your health will decline increasingly faster until you'll eventually die. However, death merely marks a new beginning. With every generation, your chances at survival will increase, because progress in previous lives increases your instincts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis demo features the first chapter of Increlution, containing roughly nine hours of content, depending on how well you perform. This demo will be available until Increlution launches into Early Access, after which the demo will become a bit shorter. It's entirely free with just the ambition to showcase what the game will be like, as well as gather some player feedback before the game launches into Early Access!",
