    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > Embark upon an unconventional quest to Save Your Mother!</h2><br>Alice Andersson, a world-renowned scholar, faces a dilemma of grand proportions when her mother falls gravely ill. No traditional cures have been able to save her; not even the most unconventional methods have worked! Join her as she discovers the legend about the Elohim Cube, a mystical artifact that might be their only hope. Long lost to the sands of time, the Cube is said to possess incredible healing powers. Over the ages, many have attempted to retrieve the cube, but to no avail. All were foiled by the long and arduous path that leads to the cube, and in turn, salvation. Will you be able to unravel the mysteries of the Elohim Cube?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/423740/extras/7e86fee60348ba918a23d824df942546.avif?t=1738872138\" width=219 height=288 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > A little info about this game </h2><br>&quot;Save your Mother&quot; is the final version of a highly successful RPG Maker game; originally created within one month for the &quot;Quest for Fun&quot; contest.
