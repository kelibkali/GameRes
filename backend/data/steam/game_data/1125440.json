    "description": "Possession is a traditional turn-based roguelike where you play as a ghost trying to make your way to the surface. You are incredibly frail, but have one advantage: you can possess the bodies of the monsters you encounter, and use their strength and abilities as your own. Hop from body to body as you attempt to make it back to the surface.<br><br>This demo features the first two floors (with two possible levels on the second floor), and your progress can be continued in the full game if you decide to purchase it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features of full game:</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1125440/extras/5c9798c6ec135bdca0742c29f13ac836.webp?t=1566513060\" width=32 height=32 /></span> Dozens of possessable monsters, from the horrifying to the hilarious, with a wide variety of powers.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1125440/extras/c69e44f8ea5763b204e96da34e53d970.webp?t=1566513060\" width=32 height=32 /></span> Special themed levels with unique hazards, creatures and layouts.
