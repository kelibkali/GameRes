    "description": "You think you know the world of Half-Life 2? Experience content that was deleted or changed in the course of Half-Life 2's development in Missing Information, a single-player Source modification. Not only does this mod restore old models, levels, weapons, and plot elements that did not survive into the final version of Half-Life 2, but our team has remade or recreated content straight from the pages of Valve's own concept art. This mod is not your typical single-player mod, as it is presented as a &quot;deleted scenes&quot; collection of self-contained playable chapters and maps.",
