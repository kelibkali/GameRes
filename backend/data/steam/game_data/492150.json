We've put together a small starter pack of assets to get you started making your first RPG World levels, and if you want a complete game assets collection at your fingertips you can check out the Creative Pack, or one of the DLCs which add themed assets if you want your adventure set in a specific game environment. You can deform the terrain in real time with modelled pieces or use more traditional terrain tools. Place a building down, decorate the inside with tables, shelves, put items on them, then grab the house and move everything inside it.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/492150/extras/53d43f75efdbdc3a37b12628c1123447.avif?t=1595002347\" width=562 height=243 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/492150/extras/587c69ebe6c89795fa513f95685ad6f9.avif?t=1595002347\" width=562 height=285 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >World Painter</h2>Get creative and totally change the feel of your worlds by painting its contents.

Create unique quest chains with kill and collect objectives, harder the quests the more XP you or visitors to your world will get! Tell stories with 'Dialog' options. Chose a faction for any character (characters can fight alongside you or against others - create a huge battle and chose if the enemies will fight endlessly until you intervene or actually destroy each other), keys to unlock gates and doors, enemy stash drops - allowing you to have enemies hold the items needed for quests. Quests can chain together and end with a different NPC they started with.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/492150/extras/f6421174731ab497b858dab2f6252352.avif?t=1595002347\" width=562 height=400 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Character Progression and Loot</h2>When you play the games you make or games made by others, you will be able to level up your characters in many ways.
