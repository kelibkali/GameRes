Wave two, Gary and Akio, will be coming next.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >As longtime aficionados of both visual novels and romcom anime we've spent the past few years pouring our heart and soul into Goodbye Dreaming, a slice-of-life dating sim that follows Robin as she explores college life and escapes her mother's shadow. Unlike many other dating sims we wanted to create a game that doesn't just end when the characters get together, but also explores the complexities of how the relationship develops afterwards.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >We have a cast of six charming characters for the player to romance, but be careful! Not everyone has Robin's best interests at heart.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Cain</strong> (CV.

Wants to be cool, but his streak of bad luck and lack of chill always end up sabotaging him.  </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Avalon</strong> (CV. Carol Anne Day) ー[COMING IN WAVE 3] ー Robin's best friend since high school and current roomie. Energetic, independent, and meddlesome.
