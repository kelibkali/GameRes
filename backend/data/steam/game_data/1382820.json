    "description": "Listen to the songs from a dark, rain-soaked city that’s desperate for justice. The noir cyberpunk score for <strong>Liberated</strong> was composed by <strong>Robert Purzycki</strong> (<i>Wanderlust: Travel Stories</i>, <i>Serial Cleaner</i>, <i>Werewolf: The Apocalypse — Heart of the Forest</i>).<br><br>Purzycki: &quot;I've listened to a lot of Burial, Nicolas Jaar, Floating Points, and Kiasmos (Ólafur Arnalds). I've also done some preparation by listening to Noisia, Lorn, and even Run The Jewels. The whole vibe is inspired by old electronic music, and I've dug really deep into the lo-fi as well&quot;.<br><br><i>Liberated: Soundtrack Mixtape — Vol.1</i> was mixed by <strong>Szymon Weiss</strong> (Weiss Video Orchestra) in a seamless nearly one-hour-long track blending electro, synthwave, techno, dark ambient and dramatic movie scores. It’s a perfect soundtrack for playing video games, night driving or hacking your government’s and evil corporations’ databases.",
