    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>NECROWARP</strong></h2><br>The entire galaxy has been corrupted by a mysterious, demoniac source of evil, which just spawned out of nowhere to screw everything up - and to be even more &quot;classical&quot;, regarding profound story twists and characters, it's up to Space Marshal Major McMâsscré to kill everything on sight that might be part of this evil (or well, just everything on sight). Of course, engaging the enemy with his prototype fighter on his own, just assisted by his neurotic tactical AI and except some of his good old friends, who might join him for a COOP session to save the day.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1200790/extras/f5c5d6cf1e87557f5b48986d03355690.poster.avif?t=1750333612\" width=616 height=346 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1200790/extras/f5c5d6cf1e87557f5b48986d03355690.webm?t=1750333612\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1200790/extras/f5c5d6cf1e87557f5b48986d03355690.mp4?t=1750333612\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>THE GAME</strong></h2><br>So if you are looking for an epic scaled 80s Scifi/Cyberpunk action shoot'em'brawl opera, fully packed with tons of weapons and customization options, plenty of gore and carnage plus bad and naughty b-movie kind of humor, then this cranky little shooter might be something for you!<br><br>Instead of just avoiding bullets, like in other bullet hell shmups (Shoot'em ups), Necrowarp also comes up with a lot of (un)forgiving brawler rampage as well, like crushing enemies with your melee weapons or by pushing them around or into each other. Of course, just as an addition to the huge arsenal of classic long-range weapons the game still relies on! And to make it a bit more, well, sadistic and personal, you're not only fighting soulless robots or drones all the time, but manned enemy vehicles, crammed with really bad gang members or soldiers (trust us; they have the wrong political attitude), zombies (of course), mutants and other funky space abominations to bring democracy upon.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1200790/extras/8fc6b85d60f38d17a2b2f8d90c8bcdd3.poster.avif?t=1750333612\" width=616 height=347 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1200790/extras/8fc6b85d60f38d17a2b2f8d90c8bcdd3.webm?t=1750333612\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>THE FEATURES</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Epic scaled 80s Scifi/Cyberpunk opera with sick b-movie humor</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Juicy massive destruction mayhem and gory battlefest action</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Different vehicles, air- and spacecrafts to choose from throughout the game</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Tons of weapons and customization options for your craft and gear</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Plenty of brawler and melee rampage in addition to the classic long-range arsenal</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A huge set of enemies with various weird and abnormal foes to fight against</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Lots of exotic places and locations in a diversified galaxy to explore</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Original synthwave and cyberpunk score to get you into the right mood</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Play the entire singe player campaign with a friend in COOP</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>State of the art visuals and smooth performance due Unreal Engine 5</li></ul>",
