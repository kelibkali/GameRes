    "description": "Bomb Sworders is a multiplayer action platformer where bombs are (almost) everything. Strike bombs with your sword to make them yours. Jump off bombs as improvised platforms. And explode bombs to take over territory and blast opponents. But watch out: they can do the same to you. To win the game, you must eliminate all opponents. But to master the game, you'll need to think fast, move faster, and anticipate <i>every thing</i>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Lots of ways to play</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Online for 2-5 players: multiple people can even join from one device.<br></li><li> Local for 2-8 players: with all sorts of combinations -- 1v1v1v1, 3v3, 7v1, etc. Plus, you can adjust the handicap setting to level the playing field. (<u>Please note</u> that the game likely only supports up to 4 <i>Xbox </i>controllers depending on your device/setup)<br></li><li> Local single player: hone your skills with some simple challenges.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Getting started</h2>You'll learn the basics with our Quick Start tutorial.
