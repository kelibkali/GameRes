The Wheel of Fate has chosen you to be its Avatar and save the world.<br><br>Fate is the force that connects all beings, maintaining order in the universe, while an ancient enemy known as The Affliction thrives on chaos. As it spreads throughout the cosmos it severs the threads of Fate’s connection, turning those it infects into deranged beings known as The Fateless. And in this battle, The Affliction is winning. So, The Wheel of Fate must pull back its shroud and reveal itself in the land of Providence and choose an Avatar to act through; a champion to fight the Fateless hordes and find the secret to defeating the Affliction.
