    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Loot and Items</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >At the core of <i>Subell's</i> item system is the dynamic inventory. There's no need to go through cumbersome menus or hotkeys to use an item you want. Spells you place in your inventory are automatically used by the Relics you have equipped, which cast them upon certain conditions. Of course, there's a separate storage space for items you'd rather not have firing off.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>With random stat boosts and triggered effects found on loot, you'll be able to <strong>configure your character in ways never dreamed possible</strong>.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1343950/extras/8b05de4b7de4f291c2ea161b8110b5f1.apng?t=1731005785\"><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1343950/extras/8b05de4b7de4f291c2ea161b8110b5f1.poster.avif?t=1731005785\" class=\"bb_img\" width=700 height=200 /></picture></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Flow of Combat</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The amount of primary weapons you can use is unlimited. By performing a Swap Attack, you pull out the next weapon from your inventory to do a special move, while placing your current weapon at the bottom. It's like drawing from a deck of cards! Arrange your weapons in your Pocket however you want, designing unique Swap Attack combos. Combine this with powerful sidearms, cooldown abilities, and spells, and find the combat style that fits you best. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Unleash your fury upon a huge variety of bosses and enemies in <strong>a mix of melee and ranged combat</strong>.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1343950/extras/7bb48e747093ba1737bf2bc29b6fc992.poster.avif?t=1731005785\" width=700 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1343950/extras/7bb48e747093ba1737bf2bc29b6fc992.webm?t=1731005785\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1343950/extras/7bb48e747093ba1737bf2bc29b6fc992.mp4?t=1731005785\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A Huge World of Dynamic Content</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Subell</i> assembles its content in dynamic ways, making no two worlds the same. From random loot to events and encounters, almost everything has a dynamic element to it. Even monsters are frequently comprised of two components, giving them a unique blend of attacks and movement patterns. Areas also have random modifiers, such as a fire area that spawns more heat-based monsters, a vampiric area, or a mechanical area. You'll unlock these areas one by one, all connected to each other to form a huge open world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>You won't only be customizing your character, but the <strong>very world itself</strong>.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1343950/extras/ac57550bb94a35297dffa0138b84a46e.poster.avif?t=1731005785\" width=700 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1343950/extras/ac57550bb94a35297dffa0138b84a46e.webm?t=1731005785\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1343950/extras/ac57550bb94a35297dffa0138b84a46e.mp4?t=1731005785\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p>",
