    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>This is an ongoing project and the <u>DEMO</u> of a multi-chapter game. Chapter 1 is complete, but the content is subject to change until the release of Chapter 2!</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>WELCOME TO THE ISLAND!</strong> </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Inspired by beloved lore-rich RPGs like Undertale and Skyrim (and a somewhat ironic parody of old RPG Maker games), Night Spasm is a silly yet saddening meta-narrative adventure game where <strong>free will is both your friend and greatest enemy</strong>. From the characters you befriend to the quests you decide NOT to complete, <strong>the game tracks and remembers your every choice, adjusting the storyline based on your real-world beliefs</strong>.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >In Night Spasm,  your curiosity and perseverance determine your freedom of choice, for better or for worse. The more you strive to understand the game's world, the more choices you can make... But with each distraction comes a journey down the rabbit hole, your desire for answers something enemies are quick to exploit. Will you let the enemy hinder your freedom? Or will you suppress your beliefs and let them dictate what little control you start with?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>&quot;OUR STORY BEGINS WITH A DOOMED NARRATIVE...&quot;</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Following the adventure of Theodore, Vander, and Evana,  you must control the lives of those around you to save the world... or ruin it further, if you so choose.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Every choice you make must be made through someone else, and the closer your beliefs align with the character, the more control you have over them. That's not to say some characters are more obedient or rebellious than others, but with the right balance of freedom and control, you can convince the characters to do just about anything... For they cannot tell the difference between your influence and their own thoughts.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >In the grand scheme of things, your wishes are their commands. After all, the characters behind your screen are just puppets designed for your entertainment, right?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >...</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >...Right? </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>&quot;THERE'S MORE TO DO THAN MEETS THE EYE...&quot;</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Explore strange locations and societies in an open-world environment to expand your colony, make alliances, recruit party members,   scavenge items, and more. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Decide friend versus foe in a hectic turn-based combat system where every kill counts, each death affecting your timeline in various ways.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Interact with your recruits to raise their stats, prepare them for battle, and learn more about their lives back home.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Force a character to fall in love only to break them up in an attempt to pursue a maniacal mastermind using nuclear sludge to assassinate an alcoholic king? Apparently, that's something you can do.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>&quot;A WORLD FILLED WITH TRIALS OF THE SOUL... AND POORLY-TIMED JOKES.&quot;</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Night Spasm isn't just a game... It's <i><strong>less</strong></i> than that: A game where you're not the hero or the villain, but merely an influence of good and evil. Without you, there is no &quot;game&quot;, but rather, a lifeless relic frozen in time, patiently awaiting the day someone comes not to &quot;win&quot; or &quot;have fun&quot;, a story that truly begins the day you abandon it.    </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Or, you know, maybe it is just a game in the end... but who's to say for sure until certain mysteries unveil themselves?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Through the game's characters, lore, world, and the choices you make, there is much to learn from. Will you take the role of storyteller and change the storyline to  your liking? Or will the vessels be the ones with something to say for once?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" style=\"text-align: center\"><i><strong>LET'S FIND OUT, SHALL WE?</strong></i></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1291100/extras/08a27e9cf0f5e0fe8140a56a0b5aff50.avif?t=1756230928\" width=1280 height=720 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Chapter 1 is free to play, and Chapter 2 is in development!</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Chapter 1 includes hundreds of unique choices to make with rougelike elements and infinite replayability. Whether you're new to the psychological-adventure genre or a total RPG fanatic, there's an adventure calling your name... and perhaps, with an extra bit of curiosity by your side, a way of breaking the very rules bound behind your screen... </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"><u><strong>THANK YOU FOR CHECKING OUT THE NIGHT SPASM STORE PAGE!</strong></u>  <br><i>For more information about the game, visit  and join our Discord Server!</i></p>",
