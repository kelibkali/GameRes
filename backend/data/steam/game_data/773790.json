    "description": "Ostriv aims to raise the bar of city-building experience by adding a huge amount of possibilities and removing annoying limitations. It allows for truly organic town layouts without the grid and angle restrictions on a three-dimensional landscape. The goal is to make player's creations to become alive and believable communities where real-life problems would arise, thus making the late game a new challenge rather than a repetitive chore.<br><br><strong>This game is still in development! Please buy it only if you want to support the development and provide detailed bug reports and feedback to help make it a masterpiece it deserves to be. The development is slow and steady, which means there can be long delays between updates</strong>",
