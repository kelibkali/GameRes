Those of us who made it are now living in ruined cities behind steel gates that separate the cities from one another and from deadly creatures roaming the wastelands. The only thing that stands between us and them are the remotely controlled war machines called ARMZ. But no machine, no matter how powerful, would be of any use without YOU, its operator.<br><br>ArmZ VR is a hellishly dynamic wave shooter that allows you to become one with a huge, heavily-armed Battle Mech! Your goal? To guard the city walls against constant attacks of horrifying human-machine hybrids. Be sure they’ll use all their skills, weapons and won’t hesitate to sacrifice their life when needed, as unlike any living being, they’re not driven by a self-preservation instinct but pure will to kill.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/952930/extras/feba34812f9722eac3fc6d041fa25844.avif?t=1657545836\" width=616 height=514 /></span><br><br>You however have what your opponents don’t. ARMZ war machine that adapts to your preferred combat style. Not fancy of sophisticated battle tactics, strategic thinking and planning three moves ahead? Grab those miniguns, start a barrage fire and cover the battle field with a hail of bullets until no hostile creature is left with its head still sticking from above the ground.<br><br>“Rambo style” combat not your cup of tea? Good! Be sure your robotic arms are capable of way more than just pulling the trigger. Use them, to get cover from bombs. Equip your mech with a harpoon to eliminate enemies from the distance. Drag them, crush them, watch them bleed and throw away what’s left of them. Then enjoy observing what impact your little horrifying show had on remaining enemies, that will literally freeze in fear. And once the situation on a battle field gets really serious, wait for the hostile horde to come anyway near an explosive, then blow it and enjoy the mayhem.<br><br>And you better be ready to make a good use of your mech’s weapons and defensive skills at all times, as each opponent you’ll be facing, starting from heavily-armored Guards having a shield and hammer at his disposal, to flying, bomb-throwing Jumpers, has their own set of skills and combat strategies, challenging your wits and testing your tactical talents.<br><br>You can play the game standing, or sitting comfortably in a chair, but you must not forget to be constantly looking in different directions and using both hands and weapons at the same time, as death can come from literally anywhere. So keeping your eyes around your head will be crucial for your victory in combat. The same applies when properly deciding on which targets to destroy first during the battle. The situation on the battlefield changes dynamically, so you need to be both quick and creative when developing your offensive-defensive strategies.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/952930/extras/ed30e4f3b2eba294f3914806faf320f1.avif?t=1657545836\" width=616 height=168 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Feel what it’s like to operate a huge, combat mech of the future!<br></li><li> A dynamic, tactical wave shooter that will require you to bring your A game;<br></li><li> Enjoy a set of different weapons designed to perfectly match your preferred combat strategy;<br></li><li> Fight diversified opponents, each with their unique skills and combat style;<br></li><li> Face your opponents in 6 levels set in three completely different environments;<br></li><li> Defend, die, repeat.
