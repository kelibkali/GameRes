    "description": "The world is a dangerous place and being constantly on the move is the best strategy to survival. However, that doesn't mean that you're completely safe, with enemies constantly trying to bring your escapade to a halt. Take control of your own SVET Scouter-Fighter and clear a path for your mothership, extending your and your friends survival minutes at a time. <br><br>Super Vecter Elite Turbo is Vecter, but to the next level. You're a scout pilot sent ahead of the mothership to ensure the area is clean and safe for its passage. You have to hunt down, at insanely high speeds, all the enemies that might get in your way and clear a path for the home that's racing behind you. Every danger that gets through, stops being your problem and becomes the mothership's problem. Your home is cruel however, so if you slow down too much it will ram right through you and you will perish. But don't worry, the mothership has plenty of you at its disposal to send out and clear its path, so just try again! The best scouts get rewarded with the best equipment and upgrades.<br><br>Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fully customizable ship, both visually and performance -  Make each ship your own<br></li><li>Expansive and complex skill tree to make every ship feel and behave differently<br></li><li>Endless procedurally-generated world <br></li><li>Bullet-hell gameplay at insane speeds<br></li><li>Rouge-like progression system<br></li><li>Multiple save slots, restart as many times as you like<br></li><li>No two runs are the same, making every experience unique<br></li><li>Sci-fi graphics with high fidelity in mind<br></li><li>Built for Steam Deck</li></ul>",
