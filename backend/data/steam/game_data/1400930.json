ALPHA SECTOR M2012.</strong><br><br>When Time breaks, there is only one department to call: The Temporal Mechanics. <br><br>Suit up!<br><br><i>Hard hat?</i> Check.<br><i>Jumpsuit?</i> Check. <br><i>Mechanical Arm, capable of manipulating time on a small scale?</i> Double check. <br><br>The Union has dispatched you to restore Time in Alpha Sector M2012 following a temporal collapse, and it’s a doozy. The world is crumbling around you and mechanical parts are behaving in strange ways. You will have to use all the tools at your disposal, your time manipulation abilities of slowing down and speeding up time, your springy jump and your front flipping double jump, to avoid the traps and overcome the many obstacles that lie in your path. You must reach the broken Mayan Temple to repair time before it’s too late. After all, you have an important date that you do<i> not</i> want to miss.",
