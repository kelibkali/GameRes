    "description": "Beverly Hills teen heiress Missy Palmer had it all - money, beauty, and popularity - until somebody murdered her. Now the only person who can see her is Sari, a nerd from New Jersey who moved into her house. Missy makes Sari glam enough to get in with her rich and famous friends and join her boyfriend’s band so she can help find out who killed her. But Sari quickly realizes that almost everyone had a motive to kill Missy, and if she can’t figure out who did – and soon – she might just become the next BEVERLY HILLS GHOST.",
