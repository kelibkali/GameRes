    "description": "Hexaverse is a turn based, 5X (<i>eXcavate</i>, eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate) multiplayer strategy game.<br>You'll strive to conquer volumetric planets against an AI or other players.<br>Some planets are as you would expect: flat, hilly, covered by oceans. Others ... not so much.<br>Feel free to design your own.<br>Sometimes you will need to build bridges to reach your destination. Or it may be strategically useful to excavate tunnels or caves ... or to blow up a mountain.<br>With more dimensions come more strategic options for you to exploit, but also more paths for your opponents to avoid your defenses.<br>Resources never deplete, but the quest for ever more also never ends. And literally undermining someone else's mines can be surprisingly effective.<br><br>In Hexaverse, good offense and defense requires diversity and cleverness. You typically don't build huge armies here, much less of only one type. Every single unit matters. A few artillery tanks in just the right spots might do all the damage you need. If that doesn't work, try nuking from sub-orbit.<br>Be careful, though, not to rely on the unseen to remain as it appears.<br>You never quite know when your enemies just might have planted a big bomb beneath your main base ... a few rounds before you installed that subsurface scanner.<br><br>Try to see everything, exploit what others can't see, for they will try to do the same to you.<br>If only that was all that mattered...",
