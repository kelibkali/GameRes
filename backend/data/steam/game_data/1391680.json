Unfortunately, his career isn’t going very well, and he’s racked up quite a debt to the mysterious Masked Man. Sondro has little choice but to make a deal with him: If Sondro can find the magic, wish-granting &quot;Mystic Orbs&quot; that have fallen from the stars and landed all across Sunova, the Masked Man won’t continue adding interest to his dues. With little to lose, Sondro turns his guitar strings into &quot;the Barbed-Lasso&quot;, and goes out on a quest to acquire treasures and recover the Mystic Orbs!<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1391680/extras/9d496ef15b37847e303a9b6cf580e3d4.avif?t=1772073025\" width=538 height=75 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1391680/extras/3fb7633685fc06e03128a4e49ffea77f.avif?t=1772073025\" width=616 height=140 /></span><br>Guide Sondro through an ancient world of wonder on his journey to overcome his financial woes and discover the dark secrets lurking in the shadows.
