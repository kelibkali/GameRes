    "description": "Arcadia is a contemporary visual novel about the advancement of technology, the isolation one feels when they don't embrace those changes, and the trappings of wanting to enjoy the past. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story centers around Roman, a recent hire at the Arcady Jazz Club, a luxurious place where one can forget the trappings of the future and enjoy the music of the past. That is, until a former co-worker, Eris, also starts working there, causing him no end of trouble as the two butt heads over how they want to improve Arcady. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTheir manager, Parker, does his best to keep the two in line, but only time will tell if these two will learn to cooperate towards a common goal or stay as caustic rivals. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game was originally created as part of the NaNoRen0 2018 Game Jam, and was finished in 30 days from start to finish. Roughly 2 hours of playtime.",
