    "description": "Originally released in 1983, <i>3D Combat Zone</i> brought the excitement of wireframe vector graphic arcade games to the ZX Spectrum home computer. Now, relive those days in this remastered emulated version.<br><br><i>After the century long bloody battle fought across the plains of Lacentra, you alone must fight to live. As sole survivor of the once magnificent home battle fleet force, you must wander the radioactive wasteland and defend yourself against the remains of the ravished enemy. You are the commander of a tank, and must outmanoeuvre enemy tanks, flying saucers, and super tanks while avoiding the structured obstacles for your solitary existence. Your heat seeking missiles are all spent, and only shell blasters remain as your ammunition source. You may only use one shell at a time.</i><br><br><br>This enhanced version introduces a number of modern features to this retro classic, including:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Saving/loading the game at any point<br></li><li> Support for most modern game controllers<br></li><li> Full control remapping<br></li><li> Image scaling and smoothing options</li></ul>",
