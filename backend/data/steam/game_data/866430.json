Fight in complex arenas with six degrees of freedom using different ships, weapons and abilities.  Each match in AS+CEND is a deliberate battle of deadly intent that can quickly become a frantic fight for your life, or resolve into a satisfying kill when all goes according to plan. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/866430/extras/5799697375e813a59f1e84d7d40b16b0.poster.avif?t=1593724584\" width=624 height=128 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/866430/extras/5799697375e813a59f1e84d7d40b16b0.webm?t=1593724584\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/866430/extras/5799697375e813a59f1e84d7d40b16b0.mp4?t=1593724584\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Think in all directions!  Each side of an AS+CEND ship has a shield which protects you from attacks from that direction.  Some of these facings also have weapons mounted.  Attacking with these weapons will let you strip the shields from you enemies, but it will also drop the shields on that side.  Claim victory by exposing your opponent's hull while protecting your own weaknesses.  <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/866430/extras/a7a75a28a31ef683f7f645c6d533099c.poster.avif?t=1593724584\" width=624 height=128 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/866430/extras/a7a75a28a31ef683f7f645c6d533099c.webm?t=1593724584\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br>We're working hard to bring more tools of destruction to the table.
