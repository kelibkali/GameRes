    "description": "In Moatboat, whatever you say happens. Use your voice to bring ideas to life inside virtual reality. Moatboat is an experimental tool that lets you create and command the world around you by simply saying your ideas out loud. Create living worlds from scratch or explore existing worlds for inspiration.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nUse simple sentences to add objects and give them behaviors. Say 'I need some sheep' to add sheep into your world. Then give the sheep something to do by saying 'Sheep eat grass' or 'Sheep jump over fences'.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nUse Moatboat to create something silly, something serious, or anything in between.",
