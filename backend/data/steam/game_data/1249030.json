    "description": "The official Ministry of Broadcast soundtrack by Benjamin McCulloch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 21 track album features music from the most memorable sections of the game; waking up shoeless, still being shoeless but having to flee ionizing radiation, and feeling even more shoeless when you have to slide on your feet across icy puddles in front of a beautiful Alpine vista. Wow. It will take you right back and then some. But you, lucky contestant, may now enjoy listening to the Ministry of Broadcast soundtrack with your feet all snug in your finest bunny slippers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContains stereo 320kbps mp3 and 44.1KHz 16BIT WAV files.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSoundtrack is approved by our greatest leader.",
