Thankfully she was able to get help for her gambling addiction and also borrow what she needed to pay off her debts from her cousin. However, was this loan divine providence, or a deal with the devil? Join Sorbetta as she tries to not only earn the money (plus interest) to pay back her cousin, but also find four fantastical treasures that will ensure Sorbetta is never bothered by Sherberta again.<br><br>It's not as if the treasures are just garbage, and Sorbetta is probably wasting her time, right?<br><br>...<strong><i>Right?!</i></strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1231740/extras/aeb8992f62fd66eed7b9814615c77083.avif?t=1724033995\" width=616 height=64 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Sorbetta</h2>The protagonist of this lovely story. A necromancer by trade, she practices when she is able using all manner of bodies, both human and otherwise, to hone her skills. Unfortunately, she developed a fondness for Blackjack. A <strong><i>big</i></strong> fondness. Some bad decisions and a couple thousand gold later, she is now trying her best to pay off her over-bearing and bossy cousin.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Sherberta</h2>Also a necromancer, like her cousin, however she specializes more with incorporeal beings rather than flesh and blood bodies. Self-serving, and ever the opportunist, she saw a perfect chance to profit off her cousin's little...problem. Even though she can be quite demanding and even a bit bullish, there does beat a heart of gold somewhere in that blue bombshell. Or, more likely, a heart that beats <i>for</i> gold.<br><br><i><strong>When it comes to the color of their skin and the outlandish attire they both love to wear, neither woman is forthcoming with an explanation. Perhaps some things are best left unexplained?</strong></i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key-Anu</h2>Not much is known about Sorbetta's <i>business associate</i>. The piano mimic spends his days in the basement bar, The Dusty Femur, longing for the day he'll get brought up to the first floor. Maybe he's just lonesome?<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1231740/extras/8980bf07ddd45233bda36aab2cc24fe6.avif?t=1724033995\" width=616 height=64 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Raise the dead for fun and profit!<br></li><li>Multiple (2) endings<br></li><li>Original comedic script that isn't another JRPG parody or satire<br></li><li>Several members of the RPG Maker dev community have cameos.
