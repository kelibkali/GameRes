Through 16-bit horror platformer stages and endless runner levels with gorgeous pixel art, she discovers that her sanity will be tested by something lurking behind the screen.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1332890/extras/f0b5f4bf9dec452dee9e0c455c868717.poster.avif?t=1713953469\" width=480 height=224 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1332890/extras/f0b5f4bf9dec452dee9e0c455c868717.webm?t=1713953469\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1332890/extras/f0b5f4bf9dec452dee9e0c455c868717.mp4?t=1713953469\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>NOSTALGIC VISUALS</strong><br>Most of the game's stunning visuals use a palette of only four colors to evoke the retro charm of 90s handheld games.<br><br><strong>SPINE-CHILLING AUDIO</strong><br>Listen to unique ambient music that provide a sense of dream-like dread as you explore the game's sinister levels.<br><br><strong>A STANDALONE CONTINUATION</strong><br>Taking place two years after the events of DERE EVIL .EXE, HopBound serves as a continuation of that story. However, users do not need to play DERE EVIL .EXE to immerse themselves in HopBound's narrative experience.<br><br><strong>HEART-POUNDING MONSTERS</strong><br>Enemies from previous games are brought back to life and have evolved into new incomprehensible forms.<br><br><strong>MEANINGFUL MACHINATIONS</strong><br>Going against sequel conventions, HopBound doesn't go bigger and badder for the scale of its story. Instead, the game focuses inward, resulting in a haunting yet meaningful tale.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1332890/extras/a6d41c6aba3ff44bd8cac755eac67d48.poster.avif?t=1713953469\" width=480 height=320 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1332890/extras/a6d41c6aba3ff44bd8cac755eac67d48.webm?t=1713953469\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1332890/extras/a6d41c6aba3ff44bd8cac755eac67d48.mp4?t=1713953469\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>HopBound has NO controller support.
