    "description": "Castles &amp; Crusades DB2: Crater of Umeshti<br>A Castles &amp; Crusades Adventure module for Fantasy Grounds<br>Castles &amp; Crusades Quick Start Rules (Free)<br>Thousands of years ago by the recollections of those elves still alive to recall<br>the fable, a great time of tumult and chaos reigned across the universe. In that<br>time the ancient citadel city of Umeshti was known as a bastion of civilization<br>through the dark night of conflict and madness. Temples to the gods and towers of<br>wizardry were erected, as were libraries and civic enterprises designed to preserve<br>and protect the knowledge that the firstborn civilizations had worked so hard to<br>gain. Art and science flourished, as did the first development of music and poetry.<br>Travelers from far and wide, including those who traveled across the many planes<br>considered Umeshti a home away from home, bringing esoteric relics and fantastic<br>wealth with them.<br>As is often the case, this great civilization thrived and grew, until outside powers<br>began to covet its success. Deities not worshipped within the city began to hurl<br>curses upon its citizens, raining down deific plagues, or striking it divine storms<br>and hordes of monstrous beasts. Despite this, the citizenry showed great inner strength<br>and resolve, facing each new disaster with its own set of champions and brave protectors.<br>In the end, the sages are uncertain, but it is said that during a great war between<br>the gods, a meteor was hurled at Umeshti, driving a shaft into the earth that stretched<br>for hundreds of feet beneath the surface, completely obliterating all but the scantest<br>trace of the powerful society which had once lived there.<br>All that remains now is a massive crater, high atop a mountain plateau, and the<br>darkened shaft at the bottom of the crater, said to lead to treasures unimaginable<br>and profound, if any survive to retrieve them.<br>In the millennia since the destruction of Umeshti, the gaping sink-hole at the center<br>of the crater has been the source of much controversy and speculation. That the<br>area surrounding the shaft left behind by the meteor is infested with all manner<br>of monstrous beast and twisted goblinoid is well documented by those adventurers<br>who have returned alive from expeditions to the crater.<br>The Crater of Umeshti is a good old fashioned dungeon crawl. Characters enter the<br>Crater and delve into its depths. They find foes both great and small and face them<br>in battles of blade or wit in order to relieve them of their treasure. They face<br>puzzles, traps, and uncover secrets and mysteries which inevitably lead the characters<br>to greater power and fortune. The Crater of Umeshti may be incorporated with its<br>other parts into a fantastic campaign, leading characters from levels 2-5 to greater<br>and greater strength and prestige.<br>The crater is designed with the intent of repeated forays into its depths using<br>a nearby settlement of the CK's choice or the characters design to re-stock, refurbish<br>and re-supply. This settlement may be found in pre-made adventure sourcebook of<br>which there are many in both D20 and Castles and Crusades various product lines<br>such as Yggsburg by Gary Gygax, or this authors own city settings such as Dro Madras<br>or that incorrigible chain of cross dimensional taverns known by most as &quot;The Roadhouse&quot;<br>and referred to by a knowledgeable few as &quot;Dirty's&quot;. See The Haunted Highlands by<br>Troll Lord Games for more details on Dirty Bowbe's Roadhouse and its environs.<br>For 4-6 characters of levels 3-5.<br>The difficulty and level needed to overcome new obstacles increases as the PCs delve<br>deeper into the sinkhole in the center of the crater. The adventure requires nothing<br>more than the Castles and Crusades Players Handbook, however Castle Keepers or the<br>CK may find the Castles and Crusade: Monsters and Treasure book by Troll Lord Games<br>to be helpful in running the adventure.<br>Begin the Adventure with: DB1 The Haunted Highland The difficulty and level needed<br>to overcome new obstacles increases as the PCs delve deeper into the sinkhole in<br>the center of the crater.
