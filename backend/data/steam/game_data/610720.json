The action in the game circles around steampunk and tells a tale of a time after a biological war, the consequences of which proved fatal for the biosphere of the planet. In a city built high in the sky, far away from the poisonous vapor, the residents spend their time without a worry or a care. Meanwhile, all the work is performed by robots. One day, however, something happens and all of the residents were evacuated by robots. The main hero Charlie decides to put a cap on the situation. The fate of the city and its people lies in his very hands. Throughout the game, he makes some unusual friends: a robot guard named Howard and a little sheep named Shaney, who share his daring adventures with him<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/610720/extras/4e3698d9aa634bc2701a9ffda70fabf9.poster.avif?t=1723603135\" width=612 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/610720/extras/4e3698d9aa634bc2701a9ffda70fabf9.webm?t=1723603135\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/610720/extras/4e3698d9aa634bc2701a9ffda70fabf9.mp4?t=1723603135\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
