    "description": "<i>A Museum of Self and Space should be a reminder of not only the beauty we can bring into the world, but how cruel that beauty can be. </i><br><br>A Museum of Self &amp; Space is a series of interactions paired with visual elements that hope to elicit specific emotions from you. AMoSaS is not fun. <br>You cannot win. <br>It isn't polished. <br>Or true.<br>Or fake. <br>It is a collection of ideas being communicated to you by Jack Hart Games. <br>You explore a museum created by Jules, a queer architect whose last work will be an exhibit focused on their failures. Moral, romantic, professional failures.<br> <br><i>I wanted to make a game where we see a strong nonbinary person old enough to look back on their life and recognize the mistakes made along the way. I don't know if there's a moral or a point in that way. What I do know is that AMoSaS is honest. I think honest works are important. If you any of that sounds interesting to you please support me by purchasing and playing my game. </i>",
