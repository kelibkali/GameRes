    "description": "This album is the soundtrack for the puzzle game Nonozle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRecorded using a Korg Volca FM, the soundtrack aims for a relatively relaxing, chill experience, befitting its state as background music for a puzzle game. It features rounded-off electronic FM synthesis sounds that are pleasing to the ear, filled out with reverb and delay. Lots and lots of delay.",
