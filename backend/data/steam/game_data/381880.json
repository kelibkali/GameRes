It won’t be easy either way.<br></li><li>You are trapped in a labyrinth: more than 100 hand-designed levels full of tension, action and mystery separate you from the exit.<br></li><li>The rope is the only weapon at your disposal.<br></li><li>Battle dozens of unpredictable enemies, learn their moves and plan yours. No tactics means death.<br></li><li>Solve puzzles: carefully observe and exploit the many mechanisms.<br></li><li>Discover a world packed with symbols to decipher and bizarre inhabitants.<br></li><li>Defeat 4 minibosses and 5 bosses on the path to triumph.<br></li><li>Climb the global chart but beware: every action has consequences.<br></li><li>The game continues beyond the screen: communication and complicity are paramount.<br></li><li>At least 10 hours of gameplay. Or 100 if you are not up to the challenge.<br></li><li>A true hardcore experience: only a few will succeed.</li></ul>",
