    "description": "<strong>Ticktock</strong> is a deceptively fast-paced arcade action game. Think fast; every fleeting second may be your last. Survive waves of monsters. Survive all 11 stages. Survive until <strong>the end</strong>.<br><br>Ticktock is a unique action arcade avoidance game, where time pauses to give you a moment to evaluate the situation and plan your next move.<br><br>With five different monsters to fend off, and 11 different stages of increasing difficulty, a great challenge lies ahead. Each stage and monster is uniquely hand-crafted to be predictable, yet complex. Six different pieces play alongside each stage, complementing the aesthetic of the gameplay to form a complete experience.<br><br>Will you be able to survive? How long can you survive?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/877070/extras/b0e564eac55fcfc06748c4639061f49d.avif?t=1530202319\" width=576 height=162 /></span>",
