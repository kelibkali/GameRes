    "description": "<p>Baseball Mogul 2008 is the 10th edition of the award-winning game that puts you in complete control of any professional baseball team -- the baseball game for fans who want their success on the field determined by their strategy, not their reflexes.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Baseball Mogul begins on Opening Day of any year you choose, from 1901 to 2007. As General Manager (GM), you control a 25-man major league roster plus up to 100 additional minor league players.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>You can make complex player trades and negotiate multi-year contracts as you build your team, but you'll have to compete with the other GMs and manage the bottom line.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Your involvement as GM does not stop in the team's front office - you also help to manage your team on the field. You set the starting defense, batting order and pitching rotation for your team. Of course, once a ballgame starts, you retire to the luxury box and its up to your team's coaches and players to get the win! A powerful game engine simulates every pitch of the game based on thousands of customized ratings and projections, assuring you the maximum realism possible!</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Baseball Mogul 2008 includes a never-before-seen interview with one of baseball's \"most outspoken, eccentric, talented, and controversial players of all time\" - Bill 'Spaceman' Lee. The former Red Sox and Expos pitcher talks about his past experiences on and off the diamond, provides insight into the game, discusses his books 'The Wrong Stuff' and 'Baseball Eccentrics', and more!</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Baseball Mogul Encyclopedia</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Database Engine</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Financial Model</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Player Development Engine</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Physics-based Simulation</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\"Save Anytime\" feature</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Ticker Tape</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Expanded Scouting Reports</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>2007 Roster</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Roster Tools</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Player and Pitcher Database</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Animated Play-by-Play</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Pitch-by-Pitch Mode</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Lefty-Righty Stats</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Fast Simulation Speed</li></ul>\n<br><br>\n<p>Note:<br>\nFor users that have purchased the game, you can install the Bill Lee interview movie from <a href=\"steam://run/5018\">here</a>.</p>",
