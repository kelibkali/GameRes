Now you have the choice of pursuing this dark truth or trying to bury it in the past.<br><br>Maybe it’s not too late to turn back now.</i><br><br>--<br><br><strong>Blackout</strong> is a non-linear interactive fiction game set in a dark modern universe, influenced by <i>White Wolf’s World of Darkness</i>, <i>H.P. Lovecraft</i> and weird shows like <i>Twin Peaks</i>.<br><br>In <strong>Blackout</strong>, you have 3 attributes that will change during the game: <i>Courage, Sanity and Fitness</i>. These attributes will also lock or unlock choices or paths, as will some items you may acquire along the way.<br><br><strong>Blackout</strong> is a game about hidden monsters and hidden fears, and ultimately about overcoming the worst adversary: <strong>one’s true self</strong>.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875400/extras/5b59c3cea4f965484e50c98da54d4b89.poster.avif?t=1629385283\" width=640 height=360 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875400/extras/5b59c3cea4f965484e50c98da54d4b89.webm?t=1629385283\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875400/extras/5b59c3cea4f965484e50c98da54d4b89.mp4?t=1629385283\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>You play as a man who finds himself lost in a dark street somewhere in the city of New Wenders. It doesn’t take long before you start having flashbacks and regaining your memory. Something terrible happened, and you were part of it. This event somehow opened your eyes to a whole new world that has been hiding beneath the shadows.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875400/extras/de511144077274b24c68a6479af9d02b.avif?t=1629385283\" width=362 height=542 /></span><br><br>As the player, you have the choice to dig deeper into this unspeakable deed or try to leave it all behind. <strong>Blackout</strong> is a game about <i>choices</i>, every chapter of the game takes place in a different location, and the order in which the chapters take place will change based on your choices. Even more so, the path you take inside each chapter varies greatly, and the effect of your choices could ripple across all chapters, meaning you could have a very different experience on a new playthrough.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >FAQ</h2><br><strong>-=How long is the game?=-</strong><br>Movie length. Expect 1.5 to 2 hours for the first playthrough.<br><br><strong>-=How many different endings does it have?=-</strong><br>Five.<br><br><strong>-=Is there a good or canonical ending?=-</strong><br>No.<br><br><strong>-=Can I die in the game?=-</strong><br>No. There is no game over, you will always get one of the five endings each time you play.<br><br><strong>-=What do I gain by playing it again?=-</strong><br>Besides trying to achieve different endings, the paths to get there can vary a lot. Items you pick up or the order in which you visit the different locations will affect possible paths, as well as your attributes.<br><br><strong>-=How many chapters/locations does the game have?=-</strong><br>There are 10 different locations (or chapters) that you can visit, the order will vary depending on your choices. There is also an Epilogue, so in total there are 11 chapters.<br><br><strong>-=Will I be able to visit all locations in one playthrough?=-</strong><br>No. Some locations are optional, and some are mutually exclusive. That said, some locations are obligatory so you will always see the main part of the story on a playthrough.",
