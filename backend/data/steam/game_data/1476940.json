You find yourself traveling along the Twin Peaks National Forest late in the night when suddenly your car gets thrown off course and off a cliff.

Can you find the right way out?<br><br><u>Features</u><br>- Multiple Endings (SKINWALKERS currently features multiple endings and a few secret endings as well.)<br><br>- Interactivity with the Game Creator (Leave Comments on what YOU think should be the next Escape method and it may added to the game in future updates.)<br><br>- Free Story Gameplay (This game has a Nonlinear story and leaves the gameplay decisions entirely up to the player, you can make this a 1 hour game or a 5 hour game.
