    "description": "The Metal Heads sound track is composed by Andy Gillion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery single track is 100% unique and original to Metal Heads, and every mini-game has it's own music track. Some music tracks also include a survival mode variation for the survival mode or &quot;sudden death&quot; mode of that mini-game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore music will be created over time as the game has more mini-games, and board game modes added to it.",
