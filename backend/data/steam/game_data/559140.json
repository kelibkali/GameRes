    "description": "We’ve all dealt with pinheads.  They are everywhere and you have to be polite to them.  I mean, I don’t want to sound like a jerk.  I know they mean well…at least most of them.  They know not just what pinheads they can be.  How nice would it be to be able to throw bowling balls at them.  Well, here is your chance!  And its legal!  You can throw bowling balls at these pinheads all day long.  Some of them will even like it.  Not only the pinheads at the end of the lane, but also the rest of the pinheads taking up space.  As long as you are playing this game, you’ll never have to be polite to any pinhead you see.  That is our promise to you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPinheads Bowling VR is a fun fun fun new way to play the classic game of bowling with animated pins that react as you bowl.  The game is built on a hyper-realistic physics simulation, so whether you like to put spin on the ball and curve it in for a strike or throw straight down the lane, you will feel like you are bowling at a real bowling alley.  That is…if real bowling alleys were filled with living bowling pins.  Watch the bowling pins get slammed by the ball and then watch them enjoy their off-hours by unlocking new activities for them as you play the game.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\n•\tOne of the most-realistic bowling simulations ever created (seriously...up until the point that the pins start animating...that part hasn't been tried irl)<br />\r\n•\tPlay in Room-Scale, Standing, or Sitting VR modes<br />\r\n•\tPlay with your friends with up to four players (with or without the headset)<br />\r\n•\tAnimated pins to challenge the player and react in fun and funny ways<br />\r\n•\tComing Soon: Add life to the bowling alley as you unlock new activities for pins who are off-duty (in full version of game at completion of Early Release period)<br />\r\n•\tComing Soon: Unlock cool new bowling balls (from in-game store)<br />\r\n•\tComing Soon: Unlock new pin sets and pin costumes (from in-game store)<br />\r\n•\tComing Soon: Download new bowling alleys with entirely new themes (from Steam)",
