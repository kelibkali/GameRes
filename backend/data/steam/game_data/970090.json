The mood will affect some of the future dialogues, as well as the endings. Since the story is experienced from 3 alternating characters, when they interact with each other, the mood comes into play, and a low mood of one character can cause negative responses from them, in turn affecting the mood of the one they're talking to.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> A prequel to Snares of Ruin, taking place within the 2 weeks preceding it.<br></li><li> An interactive point-and-click story, witnessed from 3 separate points of view.<br></li><li> The Mood System - what you choose to say or do can affect your mood, which in turn can have an effect on some of the future events and the ending.<br></li><li> A modern day urban fantasy setting.</li></ul><br>It is recommended to play Snares of Ruin first, as some of the events in this game can be spoilers for the Snares of Ruin plot.",
