    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Mythic Monsters #34: Egypt</h2><strong>Ancient Adversaries Awaken!</strong><br><strong><br><i>Mythic Monsters: Egypt</i></strong>contains an assortment of amazing adversaries for your heroes, ranging from CR 4 to 17, starting with a squadron of sphinxes to confront your adventuring heroes from the hungry hunting<br><strong>hieracosphinx</strong>to the crass but clever<br><strong>criosphinx</strong>and the proud and noble<br><strong>androsphinx</strong>. Not all Egyptian monsters are adversaries, as honorable characters may find allies in the winged<br><strong>maftet</strong>and the wise two-headed<br><strong>uraeus</strong>. Others are every inch a menace, from hateful<br><strong>werecrocodiles</strong>and sinister<br><strong>sha</strong>and<br><strong>sacred sha</strong>carrying plagues in their wake to deadly scavenging<br><strong>scarab swarms</strong>and<br><strong>giant scarabs</strong>. Of course, much of the Egyptian legendarium in popular and fantasy culture centers around tombs and ruins, and mummies are far from the only inhabitants of the necropolis, as elemental<br><strong>ahkhats</strong>are literally a part of the buildings they guard, while mummified<br><strong>cursed kings</strong>and eternally vigilant<br><strong>pharaonic guardians</strong>guard their domains with jealous and zealous care. As if a dozen existing monsters were not enough, the vicious corpse-eating<br><strong>ammuts</strong>sit in judgment on the dead and the damned. For heroes that want to embody that Egyptian vibe for themselves, this book also provides a mythic version of the treasure-hunting<br><strong>archaeologist bard</strong>and the legendary<br><strong>living monolith</strong>prestige class, anointed with a sacred stone by the ancient sphinx to serve as guardians extraordinaire.<br>The Mythic Monsters series from Legendary Games brings you dynamic and exciting mechanics alongside evocative and cinematic new abilities that really help creatures live up to their flavor text, whether they are creatures of real-world myth and legend or creatures born out of the RPG tradition itself. These creatures can work just as well in a non-mythic campaign as they do in one that incorporates the full mythic rules, as you can throw them at your jaded players who think they've seen it all or know the standard monster stats as well as you do. That look of surprise and &quot;What was THAT?&quot; will warm any GM's heart.<br><strong></strong><br>This all-new supplement by Jason Nelson, Alex Riggs, Mike D. Welham, and Jen Page is a terrific complement to the Mythic Monster Manual, with over 220 mythic monsters and an awesome array of monster-focused abilities, feats, and more for your Pathfinder game! Pick up both books today and Make Your Game Legendary!<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Charles Surette</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included Pathfinder RPG and D&amp;D 3.5/ OGL ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
