    "description": "Its a game!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake the time to appreciate just how good of a prank it will be to send this game to your friends. They'll love it! If you're lucky, they might send you a copy back, then you can both have a great laugh as your play through this simple and funny game. Playing this game is a great way to relax after a long day of work or school. So sit back enjoy the silly graphics, the retro music and fun gameplay!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith your trusty crane, grab and throw coloured crates that you find scattered around the level and put them into zones that are the same colour. But it's not always that easy! Sometimes there will be obstacles in the way that you'll have to pick up and throw first, other times you'll need to build a bridge with some of your crates so that you can get to the zone. But don't take too long, each level has a time limit!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith 20+ Levels of puzzle action and retro styled music that will get stuck in your head!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is our first ever game with zero previous coding knowledge, so its been a lot of fun learning how to code and make a game. We appreciate any support and hope you get a good giggle out of playing our game.",
