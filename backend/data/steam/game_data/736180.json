    "description": "<strong>EX0: Dark Moon</strong> is an indie retro-ish puzzle platformer made by about two and a half teens.<br><br>In it, you play as a plucky little robot named EX0 (his pluckiness is implied) who must ultimately save earth from the evil dark slimes.<br><br>Run, jump, and shoot your way through slimes, skeletons, drones, spikes, and trap blocks to get to the portal at the end of each level.  But wait, you won't be able to beat the level with your starting stats.  To win, you'll have to pick up coins throughout the level and use them to upgrade your abilities when you die.<br><br>The more you upgrade, the higher the upgrades cost, and the more you die, the less points you get for the level.  Go for that spicy high score!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >FEATURES:</h2><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">-Robots, slimes, and skeletons.
