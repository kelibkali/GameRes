Your task now is to escape. To trick maniacs and escape from captivity, you will have to come up with an escape plan using the items near you, surveying the surroundings and so on. But the main thing is to act quietly and unnoticed in order to constantly remain hidden, because the maniacs have installed surveillance cameras in the house and in the surrounding area.",
