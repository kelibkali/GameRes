One of the symptoms is proceeding isolation. The main character hasn’t left his room for more than 3 months. The person who helps him live through this hard time is his girlfriend Anna. It became obvious for both of them, that this situation can’t last forever. The time has come to look for a solution. It’s up to the player to decide how the story will progress.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/702600/extras/30f27bd53586229052deb9d6b81f60b9.avif?t=1537385403\" width=600 height=150 /></span><br><br><strong>The main topic of the game is depression and isolation.</strong> <i>Indygo</i> attempts to illustrate what people affected by mood disorders may experience.
