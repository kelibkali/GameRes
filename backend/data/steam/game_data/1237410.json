    "description": "This VR Application includes a Tower Crane Simulator and an Overhead Crane Simulator, challenging you in mastering the both very different cranes. These crane simulators will give you insight into how they are operated and some of the challenges of handling machines such as these. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Tower Crane places you high above the construction site, where you are tasked with lifting objects to assist in the construction of the building with various lifting objectives that require different techniques and simultaneously train you in how to operate the crane properly and avoid risks. <br />\r\nThe Overhead Crane located in a warehouse challenges you to complete obstacle courses in a timely manner with difficulties scaling for each Obstacle Course. These fun challenges will teach you above the operating of such a crane and how to carefully avoid bumping into obstacles while moving through the course. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey Features:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Realistic Overhead and Tower Crane simulations &amp; controls<br />\r\n- Includes Tutorials on how to operate both cranes<br />\r\n- Physics based simulation in every situation, allowing you to knock over stuff and learn from <br />\r\n  your mistakes without danger.<br />\r\n- Challenging Obstacle courses for both cranes challenging you to complete courses in a short amount of time!",
