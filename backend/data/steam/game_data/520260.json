Hit by a meteorite, you’re ejected and your food scattered all around 5 orbiting moons. <br><br>Your only chance of survival is to grab energy food to propel yourself forward. Too few energy and you'll starve to death, too much and you'll explode! When you eat, your cat gets stronger and bigger, but deflates each time you propel. Playing with gravity when you can only bump in two directions can be tricky. <br><br>Make way through 5 moons displaying different physical properties, time your jumps accordingly and tweak your catsuit to survive!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >AVAILABLE IN THE DEMO:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Start Level<br></li><li> 1 Advanced Level in the 2nd Moon with cat's upgrades.<br></li><li> 1 Advanced Level in the 3nd Moon with cat's upgrades.<br></li><li> 1 Advanced Level in the 4nd Moon with cat's upgrades.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >FEATURES IN FULL GAME:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>60 Levels <br></li><li>5 moons with different gravities and bounciness <br></li><li>Extensive Upgrade system: suit capacity, visor, weighted armor, propulsor, claws, heal pack.<br></li><li>Find Hidden levels <br></li><li>Challenge Huge bosses <br></li><li>Overcome obstacles as you progress: pikes, bumpers, magnetic winds, glue, teleports, flaming rocks, laser beams, stalling zones, various monster types, etc. <br></li><li>Deep gameplay <br></li><li>High difficulty <br></li><li>Lenghty game</li></ul></li></ul>",
