    "description": "Inspired by many classic fantasy RPGs of the past, <strong>Trials of Guinevere</strong> combines strategic, turn-based combat with the emotional, character-focused story of a visual novel. The heroes will grow and mature as the game progresses, and each will play an important role in its resolution. <strong>Trials of Guinevere</strong> explores many themes, such as the origins of personal strength, loyalty and betrayal, the meaning of sacrifice, and redemption.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Storyline</strong></h2><br>Guinevere is a regal city-state, located in the center of the continent, Vitaria. Home to over six million citizens, Guinevere is known for its proud people and kindhearted rulers. Commerce is at an all time high, and Guinevere is famed for its fishermen, craftsmen, and Arcanist enchanters. <br><br>However, Guinevere's fate wasn't always so bright. Eighteen years ago, a dangerous conqueror, known as the Warlord, sought to claim the city for himself. He planted spies and soldiers everywhere, in attempts to sow chaos and destruction. As a final blow, he managed to fatally poison the king, Leorus III. However, two heroes were chosen before the King passed: a young Frostbringer named Uriel, and his girlfriend, a Brawler, Lowangen. Together with a master of metaphysics, Kei, and a priest of Llymayn, Vhaldir, the heroes stopped the Warlord's forces and saved their home from destruction. Because of their actions, Guinevere has enjoyed almost two decades of peace. Now, a new threat emerges from within the city, and it just might be a reminder of the events of Guinevere's past...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Combat</strong></h2><br><strong>Trials of Guinevere</strong>'s combat is turn-based and continuous, with mechanics that are easy to grasp, yet enjoyable to master. The combat of <strong>ToG</strong> focuses on the classes of its characters. The people of Vitaria that show proficiency in magic are known as mages, while those that have trained in melee or ranged combat are known as fighters. These two categories form the basis for many classes, and all have unique spells and/or abilities in battle. The Alchemist is a mage that excels in stacking powerful poisons upon his foes, while the Templar is a fighter that defends her allies in battle through prayers to her Goddess.<br><br>There are no 'useless useful spells' in the game, and it will be up to you to use each spell and ability effectively. Status effects play an important role in turning the tide of battle.  Is there an enemy Priestess in the backline, protected from your fighter? You can silence her, stopping her magic for a few rounds. A powerful Barbarian that deals great damage to your frontliners can be feared, giving you a chance to defeat him before he recovers. Each character has their own strengths, weaknesses, and immunities.<br><br>Character strength is measured in Power Levels, and each comes with two abilities or spells, and possible upgrades to existing ones. There are multiple aspects that enhance combat, from Free Actions, limited use spells, Concentration, and powerful items and salves.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Characters</strong></h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1103130/extras/1eabad41374d679b44c6118de2213c77.avif?t=1684392569\" width=144 height=144 /></span><br><br><strong>Lane Conway</strong> <br><br>Lane is a young student of Guinevere's Academy of Magic.
