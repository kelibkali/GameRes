    "description": "It is 1989, due to a breakthrough success of the so-called Star Wars space defense program the United States has become a sole state entirely protected from a nuclear weapon attack. Its influence has since spread over most of the world through both diplomatic and military measures. <br />\r\nUSSR weakened by a devastating defeat in the Afghan War has been swiftly overtaken. Many large cities lie in ruin, others are being controlled by the US military forces. While the occupants are establishing control over the new territories rebels are gaining more and more members each day, many of whom have combat experience.<br />\r\nIn the demo you play as a rebel recruit tasked with retrieving an item from the enemy base. You can go in guns blazing or take out the guards silently (for the most advanced players there is a non lethal way through).",
