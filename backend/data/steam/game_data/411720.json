These abilities are upgraded throughout the match when you receive upgrade points. For every 5,000 points you gain a new upgrade point to spend on an ability. The Anti Virus gets points by isolating the Rogue Programs and by winning the round. The Rogue Programs get points by unfreezing fellow Rogue Programs, standing in the data streams, taunting the Anti Virus and by winning the round.",
