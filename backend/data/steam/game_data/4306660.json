Get your tavern up and running, elevate your tavern rating and get ready for the full game in April.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Visit the Main Game page for a full list of all the games features for the Full version of the game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Demo allows you to play the first 5 days of December, with the full game going all the way to the 25th - Christmas Day at Saint George's Tavern with (hopefully) King George III visiting. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Please visit the Kickstarter page for special deals and help fund the development of the full game.
