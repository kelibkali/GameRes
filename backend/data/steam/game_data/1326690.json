Enter into a world thick with bubbling psychedelia, swelling with an endless population of misshapen and malformed enemies. Disrupt your psychic architecture and be absorbed into the world, teeming with multiple pathways, luminous levels, and complex obstacles.<br><br>Our hero Spinch can dash, dodge, jump off walls, and shoot his own children as ammunition. Platform your way through side-scrolling levels collecting items to give you the upperhand while searching for your missing babies. Be on the lookout for your cousin - he's babysitting some of your baby cousins, but he's a little weird. Bringing back old school difficulty, Spinch will have you replaying sections until you master your timing and reflexes. The ramping difficulty will see Spinch swim through experiment water tanks, chased by hordes of weird creatures, and traverse backward and inverted environments. With only a ticking clock and quick restarts - no lives or game overs here - the game is welcoming to players of all experiences, but a formidable challenge to a speedrunner.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1326690/extras/48eb72b63447f59b344fdab60f19a9be.poster.avif?t=1751347044\" width=616 height=110 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1326690/extras/48eb72b63447f59b344fdab60f19a9be.webm?t=1751347044\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1326690/extras/48eb72b63447f59b344fdab60f19a9be.mp4?t=1751347044\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>The world of Spinch has been crafted and brought to life by talented award-winning Canadian cartoonist, Jesse Jacobs, known for his precise and detailed line work in combination with bold and simple color palettes. His works contain an affilitation with psychedelia, spirituality, alternate realities, and a blending of nature with technology. The audio landscape of retro soundbites and electronic sounds were composed by James Kirkpatrick, known for using altered electronics - modified Gameboys and other circuit-bent children's toys - to create his unique sound.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1326690/extras/6bf5d34b01eddcd425e8eea79573d2dd.poster.avif?t=1751347044\" width=616 height=110 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1326690/extras/6bf5d34b01eddcd425e8eea79573d2dd.webm?t=1751347044\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1326690/extras/6bf5d34b01eddcd425e8eea79573d2dd.mp4?t=1751347044\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
