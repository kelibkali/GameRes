    "description": "The Sword and the Slime is a non traditional puzzle-platformer where the player, using only the mouse, controls a magical flying sword on a quest through deep dungeons and enchanted forests. The player must use the sword to directly and indirectly influence the environment in order to overcome obstacles and solve puzzles. While this mostly involves hacking things up with the sword, violence doesn’t solve everything. You’ll have to think outside the box and work with an unconventional and slimy ally.",
