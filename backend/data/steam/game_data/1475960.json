You've got this!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Explore a hand-drawn, picturebook setting, accompanied by an original soundtrack stacked with bops, and full English voiceover!<br></li><li>Enjoy a short, emotional, narrative adventure presented in a point-and-click style. Shindig takes just a few hours to play - about the length of a feature film<br></li><li>Choose your look from a range of skin tones and hairstyles, and select between a masculine(ish) and feminine(ish) voice for your protagonist. (We're just two devs. It's literally us!)<br></li><li>Chill with cozy, low-stakes gameplay, and some light puzzle-solving <br></li><li>Meet a memorable and diverse cast of characters who want to talk to you about their big boggles<br></li><li>Chortle at idiosyncratic, surreal humour throughout – with a couple of silly songs, and a side-helping of real talk<br></li><li>Embark on a little, linear adventure with zero choice pressure and only one ending – the GOOD ENDING!<br></li><li>Tweak your settings with independent controls for SFX, voice and music volumes, and a Closed Captions overlay option that calls out many nonverbal sounds for our HoH players<br></li><li>While it’s not designed FOR kids (we use a few big words) Shindig has no swears or scares, just a few serious conversations in the hangouts touching on a variety of deeper emotional topics – if that’s not your bag, much of the serious stuff is in optional hangouts that you can ignore if you want to</li></ul>",
