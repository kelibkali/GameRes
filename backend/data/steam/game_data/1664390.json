    "description": "Chosen by the Light, the celestial being in charge of peace and justice, to become one of the 7 Guardian protectors of harmony and order, Young Padua must overcome the Calamity that has fallen upon all of Creation and save his fellow six brother Guardians who have succumbed to the power of the Darkness, an entity who is the personification of Evil. It is now up to Padua to single-handedly bring back balance to the Universe with his Instrument of Faith, the Might of the Light, and the sacred Hammer of Heretics. Although the Light can not aide him in his Destiny, Padua will have an angel guide through his long and rigorous journey to save the Universe.<br><br>The Instruments of Faith: Padua’s Destiny is a game aimed at the hardcore metroidvania fan base. It is an updated version of the classic formula, with epic boss battles, a deep story, nostalgic pixel art aesthetics and challenging gameplay.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Instruments of Faith</h2>These Instruments of Faith are ancient relics forged from the Light's spirit, love, strength, salvation, righteousness, glory, courage, and wisdom unlike any power in the whole Universe! <br>These wholly relics can infuse into each chosen Guardian a supernatural ability found within themselves, one which is unique to the guardian who possesses it. If a being worthy to hold an Instrument of Faith was to obtain other Instruments of Faith, however, it would only heighten that being's unique ability.  Doing this would not give them the ability of other Guardian’s unique powers, as each ability lies within that guardian from their conception and the Instruments of Faith empowers their gifted ability.<br><br>Although these Instruments were strictly made for this purpose, knowing the great powers that the Light had infused into them, these Instruments could be capable of anything.  If a being was intelligent enough and strong enough to be able to figure out how to unlock these powers that are infused inside of them from the Light, there is no telling what these Instruments could be capable of doing! These Instruments can never fall into the wrong hands.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Padua's Arsenal </h2><br><strong>The Might Of The Light - Supernatural Energy Blast</strong><br>Padua was endowed with the miraculous capacity of the Lights' own Might from the moment he was conceived. No other being has ever had the honor of carrying this mystical energy, which has untapped potential. What is known about its potential is that this Might of the Light has the ability to infuse and augment supernatural weaponry to an unrivaled level of power. Padua will have to work hard to realize his full potential because he is so young and hasn't had the time to improve his strength and training.<br><br><strong>The Hammer Of Heretics</strong> <br>A supernaturally crafted weapon molded and forged by the Light himself, made from the same substance as Mikha'el's blade and consecrated with Saints' Oils. This hammer was assumed to be a myth because of the power and destruction it was said to be capable of. Unlike other great combat weapons from the past and present, anyone can lift and use this hammer, but it's true strength and might can only be realized by someone who can harness the supernatural might of the Light's mystical energy, which was also thought to be impossible to harness until Padua was born. Despite the fact that this hammer existed, it was never to be used unless the universe was in dire straits, as the power it possessed had the potential to do as much good as destruction.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2>The Instruments of Faith: Padua's Destiny, like all metroidvania games, will have incredible powerups, attainable abilities, and inventory items to aid Padua on his quest to save the universe from the Darkness' calamity.",
