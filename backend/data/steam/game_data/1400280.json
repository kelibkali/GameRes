    "description": "New York Centrals H10a were built from the early 1900s to as late as the mid 1940s in Canada, although the vast majority came into service prior to 1930. The railroad owning the largest number of Mikados (1,350 system wide) was the New York Central (which was also the largest owner of 0-8-0 switchers, 4-8-2 Mohawks and 4-6-4 Hudsons).<br><br>As of January 1, 1946, the system had 921 2-8-2s on its roster.Class H10 Mikados, which some consider the precursor to the Lima Super-Power design. Essentially, this class was a modified and improved H7. The starting tractive effort was 63,470 lbs, and the construction dates 1922-24. They were built by both Lima and ALCO.<br><br>Many years ago in TRAINS, an unknown person surveyed all Mikados contemporary with the H10 and discovered a secret: Lima had given the H10 double the superheating surface of then other classes. A few years later, Andre Chapelon did pretty much the same thing in France, and has been hailed as a genius ever since.<br><br>Outside of that, the Lima design was an upgrade of the existing H7 2-8-2, a design that might be called average, if not mediocre. As an interesting sidelight, the Lima designer, Will Woodard, had earlier drawn up plans for a Super-Power 2-8-4 based on the USRA light design.<br><br>Comes with:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Custom e/spec<br></li><li>Scripted Effects<br></li><li>6 Chime Whistle<br></li><li>Animated Bell<br></li><li>Animated Hoses<br></li><li>Crew Figures<br></li><li>PBR Textures</li></ul>",
