It is based on the gathering of resources and creating them into various objects. Furthermore, you can sell these objects to NPCs in-game via your very own shop. The goal of the game is to either make the most amount of money possible or have the coolest/ rarest items!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1382260/extras/461df1f3ce9bb8103ca845ba98092816.avif?t=1670592227\" width=644 height=261 /></span><br>1) Search For Resources  <br>2) Build Items  <br>3) Sell Items  <br>4) Buy Items<br>5) Decorate<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Reasons to Play</h2></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Build Your Shop Empire In Real-time<br> </li><li>Competition: Compare your shop and island with your friends and try to be the one who has the coolest items or the most money<br> </li><li>Replay-ability: Continue playing and upgrading your island until you are satisfied<br></li><li> Family Friendly: This game has absolutely no violence except for the concept of fishing</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Name</h2></h2>I often get asked how I came up with the name &quot;Capital Profit&quot;. The game is very much based on the functions of capitalism, because of the buying/ selling of items and getting the most amount of money possible. Plus it was a word that my friend liked after I suggested to him (I'm all about that friendly teamwork). Now the word &quot;Profit&quot; is mostly based on profiting from the work/ play-time you put in the game. Therefore Capital Profit are two words that represent the game very well.",
