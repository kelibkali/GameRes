    "description": "Colony Antares is a turn-based strategy game with a light 4X theme focusing on the exploration and colonization of an alien planet. Set in the distant future, survivors from the destruction of the SS Daedalus have crash landed on a planet called Antares. It's a hostile and unknown environment and without your help they will not survive. You play as the administrator of the colony and must guide your people in this new harsh world. Will you Terraform the world to suit your needs, Assimilate your people into the ecosystem, or Escape back to Earth?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is played out with a spread of cards, each card representing a building, technology, place to explore, or creature. Each turn you assign colonist cards to carry out tasks, make choices about the direction of your colony, and defend the colony from attack. Explore the world, discover new cards, and solve new challenges in your bid to survive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nColony Antares features multiple different scenarios, each with its own story and challenges.",
