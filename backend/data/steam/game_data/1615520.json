    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >     D&amp;D Classics - Night of the Shark (2E)</h2>&quot;When the storm comes in with its teeth, teeth, teeth...&quot; Black clouds build on the horizon with supernatural swiftness as the light of day drains away like a guttering candle. As the wind screams and sea spray blinds the eyes, the masts splinter and the deck heels over, a plaything of the storm. A nightmare shark hunts the murky ocean for all that succumb to the hammer of the winds. Can anyone survive the Tempest of the Deep Mother?<br><i>     Night of the Shark</i>     is the second part of an adventure trilogy featuring the evil sahuagin, deadly sea devils in pursuit of an ancient relic known only as The Stone Which Abides. This adventure can be played independently, or it can be linked together as part of the adventure series that began with<br><i>     Evil Tide</i>     and concludes with<br><i>     Sea of Blood.</i><br><i>   <strong>     We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today.
