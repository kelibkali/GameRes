In addition you can also turn off the &quot;Enable character VFX&quot; checkbox, which will turn off all particle effects other than the donation coin fountain (which is significantly reduced to save your CPU)<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >RESOURCES:</h2></strong>If you're looking for instructions for how to use the app, you can press F1 at any time to get a full list of instructions, or visit the youtube channel for tutorials on all the Streamer Dancefloor features <br><br>If you'd like to try some of the ready to use venue backgrounds taken from popular Toronto venues pre-covid click here: <br><br><strong>OBS SETTINGS NOTE:</strong>  The preferred settings I use is Window Capture with Capture Method set to Windows Graphics Capture, probably want to turn off capture cursor as well. <br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >DESCRIPTION</h2></strong><strong>Streamer Dancefloor</strong> lets you create a custom virtual dancefloor for your chatroom on <strong>Twitch, Facebook or YouTube</strong>.
