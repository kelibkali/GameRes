    "description": "For victory you need only three tools - Cannons, Lasers and Rockets! Discover a spaceship MOBA game with 2D combat in 3D environment, wide variety of play styles and fun gameplay for casual and pro gamers alike.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe wanted to make something that we ourselves would like to play - a game chock-full of what’s cool about spaceships shooting each other up and with none of that boring stuff.<br />\r\nWe set out to make a game with both a light-hearted gameplay that is hard to find today and deep tactical potential that allows for sophisticated approach to team play.<br />\r\nSo we made Cannons Lasers Rockets - a fast-paced, bright and colorful space arcade equally enjoyable for hardcore and casual gamers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn our game you will discover that: <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSPACE COMBAT IS EASY <br />\r\nA videogame spaceship is usually not an easy ride - three-dimensional navigation makes you dizzy and disoriented. But in CLR you struggle against your opponents, not against your controls. We simplified gameplay just enough so you wouldn’t need to BE a great star pilot to FEEL like one.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSPACE COMBAT IS INTERESTING <br />\r\nNo boring parts, only what you come for - going into combat to send some rockets into the other guy’s hull.<br />\r\nAnd if you eventually get a little tired of shooting, and start looking for more - be sure that we will give you more. Multiple game modes, a metric ton of different tactical situations, a MOBA core that creates many possibilities for fun and meaningful gameplay - and even more!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSPACE COMBAT IS FUN <br />\r\nWe don’t really know what «realistic» starships will look like, so we don’t really care. A ship in a game should be fun to look at and fun to ride in, period. We want ships to be weird, plentiful and different - everyone will find one that is suited just for them, both in visual style and the distinct way of playing that comes with every ship. <br />\r\nWe streamlined our gameplay as much as we could, and then we turned the coolness knob up to eleven!",
