You play with your keyboard. We have developed the game to feel like an old school arcade, hard, very hard, super punishing space shooter. The game is not easy and you will die a lot. Please take caution, if you're in the mood for something that will hold your hand or let you win, you're in the wrong place. Star Drifter is ideal for casual gamers that enjoy a real challenge. Prepare to be destroyed over and over again, lose your score and rage at the computer.<br><br>Thank you and good luck!<br>Dan and Martin.",
