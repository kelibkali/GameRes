    "description": "Solitaire or bowling? Two in one!<br />\r\nComplete 120 levels in Strike Solitaire!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game utilizes a unique setting for solitaire games where the action takes place in bowling hotels offering a wide range of recreation services and outdoor sporting activities. All levels are split into 12 packs, 10 levels each. Each level symbolizes one frame of a bowling match.<br />\r\nAll levels look like a solitaire set of cards. Players should remove matching pairs of cards from the game board in order to complete all the level goals. The goal of each level is to remove 10 special skittle cards from the game board.<br />\r\nBy doing that, players earn money. The amount of money players receive on each level depends on the type of the matching cards and the multiplier.<br />\r\nUpon the completion of each level, players also earn scores (just like they would earn scores for each frame in a bowling match). The number of points earned within the whole frame is calculated according to the attained scores.",
