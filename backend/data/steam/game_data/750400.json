    "description": "Two Inns at Miller's Hollow is a fun take on classic deduction party games. Unlike most of those, players are never eliminated and forced to sit out until the rest of the game is finished.<br><br>Eight players are randomly divided into two teams; Church or State. Depending on your affiliation your job is to either protect your king from being discovered and converted to church, or aid the church in their search. Beware though, during the night some roles might have special abilities. <br><br>Two Inns at Miller's Hollow has two game modes and 10 roles (more coming soon).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Modes</h2><strong>Normal</strong><br>In this mode the game is played over 4 rounds called days. <br>The mode includes the following roles:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>King<br></li><li>Pope<br></li><li>Knight of the Crown<br></li><li>Knight of the Temple<br></li><li>2 random State roles<br></li><li>2 random Church roles</li></ul><br><strong>Ranked</strong><br>Ranked mode is currently <strong>disabled</strong>. Once we have a stable community and balanced rule set we will enable this option but don't want to turn it on before it's ready.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >State Roles</h2><strong>King</strong><br>Your job is to stay hidden and not get found out by members of the Church. If at the end of the game you are in the same location as the Pope the state will lose.<br><br><strong>Knight of the Crown</strong><br>Your job is to help hide the king and find figure out which players are members of the Church.<br><br><strong>State Spy</strong><br>When sharing with members of the Church your affiliation will appear to match theirs, however sharing with members of the State will show your real allegiance.<br><br><strong>Captain of the Guard</strong><br>You secretly know who the King is. During the night phase you can elect to protect a player at your location. If they are voted out in the morning you will take their place and leave instead.<br><br><strong>State Psychic</strong><br>When in the same location as the Pope or Psychic (church), you get a sense of someone special. If both are in the same room with you however, you get nothing.<br><br><strong>Wereworlf</strong><br>You can visit a player at night and scare them. They will be unable to vote in the morning, but they will also know that you are the werewolf.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Church Roles</h2><strong>Pope</strong><br>Your job is to stay hidden and not get found out by members of the State. If at the end of the game you are in the same location as the King the church will win.<br><br><strong>Knight of the Temple</strong><br>Your job is to help find the king and arrange for the Pope to visit his location on the last day.<br><br><strong>Church Spy</strong><br>When sharing with members of the Church your affiliation will appear to match theirs, however sharing with members of the State will show your real allegiance.<br><br><strong>Fanatic</strong><br>Your fevered support of the Church allows your vote to have more impact when selecting a player to leave your location. However, this rabid church support means that you can't decline a share request.<br><br><strong>Church Psychic</strong><br>When in the same location as the Pope or Psychic (state), you get a sense of someone special. If both are in the same room with you however, you get nothing.<br><br><strong>Witch</strong><br>At night you can put a hex on a player preventing them from using any of their special abilities until the following night. This does not work on Spy's however.",
