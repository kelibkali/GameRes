    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong> </strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>The year is 2182.</strong> High Command has dispatched the <i>USS Almayer</i> to the frontier. You are a member of the <strong>Falling Falcons</strong> - 2nd Company, 2nd Battalion, 4th Brigade.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Your orders are simple: Respond to an unknown distress signal, secure the colony, and neutralise any threats. But on the rim of known space, nothing is ever simple.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>BYOND: \tBuild Your Own Net Dream</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Built on the ancient, accursed, yet still beloved <strong>BYOND</strong> platform, this isn’t regular <strong>SS13</strong>; it's a completely overhauled multiplayer roleplay tactical disaster simulator. It looks like a game from the 90s, plays like a milsim from the future, and breaks like a cheap lawnmower.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Whether you are holding the FOB, performing open-heart surgery in a sand pit, or playing a xenonid trying to figure out how to open a door, your actions define the round. Every bullet must be accounted for, every wound requires surgical precision to treat, every host must be incubated, and every order must move down the chain of command.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Massively Multiplayer:</strong> Theoretically high player counts allow for full company-scale operations, meaning lots of people screaming over the radio at once or complaining that the Empress is micromanaging the hivemind.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Complex Medical System:</strong> Health isn't just a bar. Treat broken bones, internal organ failure, and overdoses. If the xenonids don't kill you, the medic mixing up the labels on the pill bottle might.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Destructible Environments:</strong> Blow open walls with C4, weld doors, or burn down the entire jungle because you saw a spider.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Logistics &amp; Command:</strong> The war isn't won by shooting alone. It’s won by the shipside support crew, including the <strong>Requisitions Officer,</strong> who orders the ammo for your rifle, and the <strong>Executive Officer,</strong> who really didn't mean to accidentally orbital bombard Delta Squad.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Roleplay First:</strong> Immerse yourself in the hierarchy. Follow orders, shout tactical info over the radio, and engage in the unique &quot;culture&quot; of the Falling Falcons.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Emergent Storytelling:</strong> Will you hide in a locker for 45 minutes as a suvivor? Will you robust a xenonid with a toolbox? Or will you succumb to liver failure after finding the colony's vodka stash?</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Corporate Interests:</strong> Roleplay as a Liaison from a shadowy company that cares more about the quarterly profit margins than your survival.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Hostile Third Parties:</strong> Sometimes it’s insurgents. Sometimes it’s high-tech hunters. Sometimes it’s just the Military Police arresting you for not wearing your helmet. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>⚠️ WARNING: READ BEFORE ENLISTING ⚠️ </strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>1. Ancient Technology: </strong>This game runs on <strong>BYOND</strong>. When you click &quot;Play&quot; on Steam, it will install the BYOND requirements for you. Yes, you sometimes will get an popup for Byond Premium when it boots up. <strong>Lummox JR </strong>has to eat somehow. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>2. The Learning Cliff:</strong> The controls are not intuitive. You <i>will</i> accidentally shoot your foot. You <i>will</i> drop your gun in the middle of a firefight. You <i>will</i> struggle to open a bag of chips.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The <strong>UI </strong>looks like the cockpit of a 747-800. Take a moment to read the starter guide, call a Mentor (F1), or just ask the Marine standing next to you how to put your helmet on. We were all bald and confused once.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>3. Roleplay Expectations: </strong>aka <strong>Yes, you have to play as a Character. </strong>This is a <strong>Medium Roleplay (MRP)</strong> environment.</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Names:</strong> Name your character something believable, not &quot;xx_Headshot_King_xx&quot; or &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi.&quot;</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Behaviour:</strong> You are a Marine (or a giant bug). Act like one. If you run around griefing your teammates or screaming internet memes in the chat, you will probably hear the dreaded <strong>Bwoink</strong>. That is one of our volunteer Moderators coming to have a <i>very</i> polite conversation with you about your life choices.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>4. The Rules:</strong> Read them. They exist to keep the chaos fun, not frustrating. If you break Marine Law, the MPs will arrest you. If you break Server Rules, the Admins will probably ban you without much fanfare.</p></li></ul>",
