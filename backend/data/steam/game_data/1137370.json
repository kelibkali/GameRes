Infuriated by the thought of the government hoarding all the alien girls for themselves, the masses rise up and decide to raid Area 51 to get an alien girlfriend of their own. But the military will be there waiting for them. Assume the role of a lone military defender, protect the alien girls, and kill all the invaders! Kill enough of them, and the government might give you &quot;some time&quot; with one of the alien girls. Or, you can abandon your mission, and seek out an alien girlfriend on your own.
