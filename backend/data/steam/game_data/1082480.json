    "description": "Buzz Kill™ Zero is a new shooting game heavily based on early 80's retro shooters, but with a bullet hell edge! One of Earth's satellites has gained consciousness &amp; has created an army to destroy all humanity. Blast your way through 5 challenging missions, using different weapons &amp; abilities to decimate the opposition. Rush enemy kills together quickly to increase your points per kill &amp; get a super high score. Four different skill levels to challenge all from newcomers to experts. Compete against the world on leaderboards for the high score &amp; earn achievements to prove your skills. Do you have what it takes??<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Game Play</h2>Like most retro shooters, you move from side to side destroying enemies as they attack you in waves. As the game progresses however, the waves become less defined, the number of enemies becomes more insane, and their attacks/patterns become much more complexed! To help you deal with all of this madness, you have several abilities that you can use at any time, but you must 'buy' it for at the cost of some power. As you destroy enemies quickly, your RUSH multiplier goes up, letting you get more points.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story</h2>Many years ago, a highly advanced satellite named PROJECT BUZZ was sent deep into space. After several years, contact with it was lost. Unknown to us, however, the satellite somehow became conscious. Growing both a hatred for &amp; jealousy of humanity lead PROJECT BUZZ to create an army to destroy all humanity and be her children. Now, you have been sent out to save the human race from a monster of our own creation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Pure, retro arcade simplicity mixed with the deep score mechanics of a bullet hell!<br></li><li> Build your power to fire more powerful attacks, or sacrifice some of it to use your other insane weapons/abilities!<br></li><li> Unforgettable, exciting boss encounters that will bring your adrenaline to the MAX!<br></li><li> Mesmerizing 16-bit graphics with a great soundtrack!<br></li><li> Five crazy, unique missions. Fight through an enemy battleship, asteroid field, &amp; more!<br></li><li> Four skill difficulties to suit all play styles, from the tameness of Level 1 for beginners to the absolute stupidity of Level 999 for the thrill seeker!<br></li><li> Several different modes, including a Survival, Caravan, and GalaPachi; each with their own local and online leaderboards for global competition!<br></li><li> Rebindable controls, additional side art work, and TATE mode!</li></ul>",
