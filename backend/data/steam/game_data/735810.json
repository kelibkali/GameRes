    "description": "Cyber Surf is a VR flying game where the player races to discover new worlds. As a dimensional explorer and adrenaline junky, your goal is to compete with other adventurers, get through checkpoints and build your score to be awarded with a new environment to plunge into. <br />\r\nAn assortment of different Cyber Surf Boards are available to choose from, in order to help grind the competition into dust. Each with their own individual handling. Modes can be tailored to fit the competitive nature of each individual player, ranging from Time Trial to Exploration. Ditch your gamepad controller and use the custom-built surfboard controller to reach a whole new level of immersion.",
