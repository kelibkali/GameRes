    "description": "<strong>A Game Without Meaning.<br>A Game Nobody Should Play.</strong><br><br>When the Darkness comes is a walking simulator whose glitchy and dark tale tries to illustrate the hardships of depression and anxiety through a variety of imaginary digital landscapes.<br><br>A clock, a piano and a girl. What do they all mean?<br>What is meaning, anyway? What has meaning?<br>Do you have one? A path, a goal, something determined, pre-determined?<br>A light to follow?<br><br>Discover a world filled with loneliness and fear. A world where despair breathes and hope dies. A world about you, about us. A world about humanity and about life.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Before Starting</h2>This Experience is <strong>NOT</strong> for everyone.<br>This Experience explores themes such as <strong>depression, anxiety, verbal abuse, manipulative control, and suicide</strong>.<br>This game could also potentially trigger <strong>epilepsy</strong> attacks.<br>Seriously, do <strong>NOT</strong> play this Experience if you believe this might affect you in <strong>any </strong>way.<br><br>The first Arc should take about one hour to complete.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About the Experience</h2>This was the culmination of a self exploration into my own psyche. If it can help anyone else explore their own I am thankful for that, and if the game isn't to your liking I appreciate you taking the time to try it anyway. I won't be updating it anymore (safe for major bugs) since it was simply an outlet for my own creativity but enjoy it as it is.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Controls</h2>Movement: <strong>WASD</strong> or arrow keys<br>Interact: <strong>F</strong><br>Jump: <strong>Space</strong><br>Sprint: <strong>Shift</strong><br><br>There's a toggle to swap between AZERTY and QWERTY layouts in-game.<br><br>This Experience might not be suitable for streaming audiences.",
