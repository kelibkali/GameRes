    "description": "<i><strong>Cahors has always been your life; you never had any interest in leaving. The small French town is the landscape of all your memories: the sweet and the bitter.</strong></i><br><br>Cahors Sunset is a light-RPG in which you control the decisions of an old French man. In this game your goal is try to keep the main character alive for as long as you can through the decisions you make each month. Every action you take has an effect on your character and not all choices are good; many contain unwanted side effects. The idea is to balance the positive and negative effects of each action you take and the impacts they have on the old man's health.",
