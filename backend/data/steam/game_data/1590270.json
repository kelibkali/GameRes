    "description": "<strong>Partitas</strong> is the musical game based on <strong>melody.</strong><br><br><strong>It is classical music rich,</strong> so it suits those who like it and also those who want to know more of it!<br><br><i>The universe played a practical joke on you: your music scores were stained and are unreadable! Listening to the songs and rewriting them is the only way out.</i><br><br>It is the ideal game for any <strong>music lover:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>No need to understand sheet music</strong> to play<br></li><li><strong>150+ notes</strong> to be resolved, both the melody (higher notes) and the accompaniment (lower notes)<br></li><li><strong>11 different composers</strong>: Chopin, Schumann, Beethoven, Schubert, Bach, Mozart, Saint-Saens, Ravel, Mendelssohn, Granados, Chiquinha Gonzaga.</li></ul><br>At the end of each challenge, you have the opportunity to<strong> relax and listen to the complete piece</strong>, performed by a true<strong> pianist.</strong><br>At that moment, you contemplate the <strong>pixelated scenery,</strong> which can be <strong> customized</strong> by buying<strong> collectibles</strong> using the game's currency.",
