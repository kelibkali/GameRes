The Environmental Mass Manipulation Apparatus is an all-in-one, one-man, heavy-duty lifting machine—capable of hurling heavy objects (and her user) across and about once-thought inhuman spectra.<br><br>She's not just efficient—she's the E.M.M.A.!<br><br>Workshop support is planned post-launch. Stay tuned to experience new puzzles and other unique community-driven experiences.",
