We didn't really know what that meant, only that it seemed to involve sending her to &quot;special schools&quot; because she couldn't handle being in a normal one. So we sent her to the newly opened St. Mary's Boarding School for Gifted Children. She seemed to be happy there. She even made a friend called Ava. I didn't like her, though. Ava told Carrie-Ann stories, disturbing ones, about things her parents and other people allegedly did to her. I told Carrie-Ann to stay away from her, but I don't think she ever listened.<br><br>One day Carrie-Ann called us saying that some of the students had gone missing. We spoke to the teachers but they said it was just a story: a made up urban legend. We tried to speak with some of the other parents, but nobody seemed to be talking about it. Not too long after, the school closed down. &quot;Structurally unsound&quot; they said. Oh, if only I'd known then what I know now. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>SNEAK, STUMBLE AND STALK YOUR WAY THROUGH THE GAME IN FIRST PERSON - with future support for Oculus Rift.<br><br></li><li>SNOOP AND PEEK - as you venture deeper into Saint Mary's you will come across holes and cracks in the walls to peer through.
