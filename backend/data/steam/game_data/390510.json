    "description": "Sim Junta – A game of dirty politics!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWelcome Sir. <br />\r\nYou are the new dictator of Risuena, a small and poor country of the third world. You have just seized power after a bloody coup and your intentions are to stay in power as long as you can, to rip this country off, transfer the money to your secret Swiss bank account and of course, stay alive and enjoy your wealth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe problems in your plan are the various parties of Risuena's society who also want to benefit and survive throughout your Junta, the Guerrillas who try to seize power, the Americans who support your dictatorship but expect something in return and the next men in power after you, who are waiting for a chance to betray you!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSim Junta is developed as a retro game of the 80's 16-bit computers. It is a statistical management game of brutal and violent politics, since it is a game that has dictatorship as a theme. It is a humorous but very deep strategy game.",
