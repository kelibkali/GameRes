    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >   Crypt of the Devil Lich</h2>An ancient prophecy sends your heroes into the crypt of the Devil Lich. They must destroy her, before she can return to power. Once inside, your heroes face horrors that could only be dreamt of by a mad half-drow half-fiend lich!<br>The heroes are sent into the Devil Lich's crypt to destroy her before she can return to power, as foreseen in a prophecy. However, the unknowing heroes have actually been tricked into entering her crypt to free her from her prison. If they are truly heroes, they will uncover the deception and defeat the evil Devil Lich before she can unleash her dark designs on the surface world.<br>The 5E edition of the adventure is designed for a group of four to six 15th level characters<br>The original adventure was designed for Gen Con 2004, where Goodman Games ran the First Annual Dungeon Crawl Classics team tournament. This tradition of competitive tournament dungeons continues to this day. The adventure can also be used for campaign play and as a one-shot non-competitive module - but of course it also works well as a tournament.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Charles Andrews</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included 5E Compatible ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
