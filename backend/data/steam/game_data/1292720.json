    "description": "Choose a character, a setting, and start typing. Want different characters? Add your own!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nType the words as they appear on screen as fast as you can. When time's up you can see the results of your work in a quirky way. Each word you type also gives you points that can be spend to change the game up for the next time. If that's too easy the game has a hard mode that gives you more points for longer and more challenging words.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game also allows you to import characters that you can bundle up with the free version of unity, then drag and drop and play with whatever character you like. A tutorial on how to do this is available on the linked youtube channel.",
