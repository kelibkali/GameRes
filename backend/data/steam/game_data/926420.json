    "description": "Model trains and Christmas time on your screen!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can build highly detailed and functional model railway layouts in this game in a TRUE 3D graphics environment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can start with an empty snowy landscape and populate it with beautiful 3D models of engines, wagons, buildings, plants etc. All the little models were made in this game in wonderful snowy Christmas style.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreating the track layout is very easy with the self explaining menus, which offer always only the possible actions during the use. The length of the track is practically unlimited. You can add as many switches as you want, only your fantasy limits the complexity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPut engines and wagons on the built track and just push them with your finger, and they start to move. They will travel the prepared track and stop automatically at the placed stations. If a train reaches and end of the track, it will stop, and move backward after a few seconds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdd different houses, buildings, plants, roads to increase the reality of your layout, and enjoy the beautiful details of all 3D models and the appearing snowy scenery and the Christmas mood.",
