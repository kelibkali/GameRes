    "description": "Blocks of Nature is a casual puzzle game. The objective is to combine three or more cubes of the same color and to keep scoring until cubes build up too high.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Beware of the cold</h2>Winter has come. Cubes that fall on the ice block on the ground or touch other frozen cubes will freeze over time. Once frozen, they cannot be broken unless they are melted with lava cubes. However, lava cubes are rare, so use them wisely... <br><br>Lava cubes cool over time and turn into rocks. These rocks can be removed by combining atleast three of them together, like normal cubes. <br><br>Temperature falls as you gain levels, so cubes will freeze faster and lava cubes cool down faster too. For unknown reasons, as the temperature drops, it \tconveniently also makes cubes to drop faster. Maybe it´s the magic of Lapland?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Rainbows to the rescue</h2>Rainbow cube is a special, but unfortunately a very rare cube. It will destroy every unfrozen cube of the same color that it lands on. It works for lavacubes too! Extra 100 points are granted if you are brave enough to land it on frozen cube or on the ice on the ground (It won´t do you any good, but hey, 100 points!).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Casual or competitive?</h2>Seemingly so casual game can find itself being quite competitive if you challenge your friends in this game! There is an ingame online leaderboard too!",
