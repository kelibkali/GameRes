Each planet has its own vegetation and unique characteristics. In each planet's missions, a different victory condition must be met: either all crystals must be mined or alien artefacts must be collected. In addition to this, there are a variety of command missions that require special objectives to be achieved. <br></li><li>Hero units: <br>There are a variety of heroic units in the game. While they are not unstoppable &quot;super units&quot;, they can provide an advantage in combat or open up new strategic options. They will surely help you succeed if you use them wisely.<br>As soon as Hero units are summoned, they can be called in other missions without having to use resources. They level up after each mission, becoming stronger, along with your progress. New weapons become available, upon reaching a certain level.<br></li><li>Explore and exploit: <br>Take advantage of all the resources available on alien planets to make your company a success. Utilize the most effective available strategy for your armies and use as few resources as possible against the countless alien hordes on the enemy planet.
