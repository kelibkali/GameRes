This is such an amazing way to learn&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Awesome educational app&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I'm a huge fan of educational apps and this one hits the mark!&quot;<br />\r\n____<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnimersiv is the largest platform for VR educational experiences. Our app for the HTC Vive includes multiple field trips (from the ISS to the Acropolis of Athens) that will let you learn using Virtual Reality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPurchasing the Unimersiv app will give you an unlimited access to all of our content as well as future updates.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe strongly believe that Virtual Reality should not only be used for gaming but that it can also have a great impact on Education. We created the largest library of VR educational experiences to let you explore Rome as it was thousands years ago or walk on the Acropolis of Athens or even alongside giants Dinosaurs to see how they were living and what they were eating.",
