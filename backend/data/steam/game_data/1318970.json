    "description": "Let us begin our tale, in the quiet city of Verona, Italy. A town for lovers... and giant, mutant flower attacks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the leader of the Stratford-Upon-Avon High Drama Society, Imogen is no ordinary girl! Sure, she goes to school every day and helps produce plays for the community, but beyond that, she's a magical girl! With her powers, she can teleport to alternate dimensions based on Shakespeare plays, fight back the forces of Nightmare, and still get back in time for dinner!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJoin Imogen, Paulina, Viola, Rosalind, Miranda, Beatrice, and Kate on an epic adventure throughout the Shakespearean metaverse in this comedy JRPG!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n• Unique, turn-based combat!<br />\r\n• Hang out with your friends!<br />\r\n• Put on plays!<br />\r\n• Shakespearean dialogue too difficult to parse? No problem with our unique Ye Olde English to New English translator! 110% accurate!<br />\r\n• Multi-character unite abilities!<br />\r\n• Teaches you while you learn!<br />\r\n• Get a pet!<br />\r\n• Pacing that doesn't waste your time!<br />\r\n• Fun for the whole family!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe believe that world needs more bite-size turn-based JRPGs - short, self-contained games that you can enjoy over a weekend or a few play sessions when you want a change of pace from big epics. Something that's all killer, no filler. We estimate that a single playthrough of This Way Madness Lies will take around 5-10 hours, depending on difficulty &amp; playstyle, and we hope that you will enjoy every minute!",
