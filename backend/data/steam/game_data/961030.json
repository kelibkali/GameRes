    "description": "A world once built by man, but abandoned for a better place, is controlled by a supercomputer – “The Node”, whose primary objective is to create an ultimate soldier using randomly generated combat locations. Good old mechanics of a classic shooter game mixed with roguelike elements, but… in Virtual Reality! Strictly non-casual, only free roam, only hardcore!<br />\r\nThe game is powered by the cutting-edge UNIGINE 2 Engine.",
