    "description": "<strong>Royal Agents: Sweet Zombie is a turn-based squad game with unlikely agents trying to stop evil in time for tea. </strong>You control a team of three agents of the crown with different skills and backgrounds, tasked with the assignment to investigate and stop any evil-doings in a graveyard.<br><br>This game has a short game loop and is only played on one small map, a round may take 10-15 minutes. You will likely fail your first go, but get to know the agents – all six of them – they have unique advantages and can be combined in different ways to form your squad of Royal Agents. The enemy can also be studied for patterns in behaviour, and the map contains items that will help you succeed.<br><br>Sweet Zombie is the first instalment in the Royal Agents series of scenarios.<br><br>This game is made by Christian Knutsson and Mikael Reidal.",
