    "description": "The city of Hevland went through many revolutions, but not without its costs. Powerful corporations turned the city into chaos in an attempt to control the government and monopolize the technology, resulting in an event called the Black Hole. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEngel Dekker survived in the now dangerous and violent city, living in the shadows of the streets and stealing supplies. When stepping in to do a heroic action for a change, he meets a Vulto, a kind of special agent who operates in the shadows to minimize violence and revert the damage Hevland suffered, and decides to go through heavy training to become one of them. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollow Engel in his journey into becoming a Vulto. Take down the enemies before they knocked out, or avoid them like the good stealth agent you want to be.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVulto is turn-based strategy game inspired by the GO genre of games, in a cyberpunk setting.",
