But now that they have been shipwrecked, they will have to work together to survive their greatest foe of all… themselves. Once again the misfits from Blood Gulch find themselves stuck in the most worthless piece of real estate in the galaxy, or so they think. When dark forces align against them, they realize there’s a lot more at stake than just being rescued. And to survive, they might have to do what they do worst… fight.",
