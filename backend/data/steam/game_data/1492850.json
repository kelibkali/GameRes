    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Mulligans Golf Game is a wacky, arcade golfing game. Gameplay is designed to give the player complete freedom to play how they want in the world of a simplified yet challenging golfing experience. It is not a Sim! But it is designed to provide the scenarios and emotions that come when playing real golf. Players choose from the available pool of legendary characters and hand crafted courses, either playing solo or with friends up to 3 Friends (local split screen or online), attempting to set new Personal Bests, going for Course Records (local and global leaderboards), or challenging friends to see who is the best!<br><br><i>For a detailed Road map for the game, please visit our Discord</i><br><br><i>Below is a breakdown of what to expect for features from the game! </i></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Early Access Release (V0.7) Features</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Legendary Characters</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Skins to unlock for each by levelling</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Character Personal Best Score tracking per Course</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Handicaps tracked for determining World Ranking</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Multiple ways to Golf</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Tutorial, Single Player, Split Screen (up to 4 player), Online (up to 8 player)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Variety of Golf Match types, modes and settings</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>More Maps to Play!</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A variety of Courses to play</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Download and play Community Designed Maps!</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Local and Global Leaderboards for every Course</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong> Golf Carts</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Rentable Golf Carts that can be used to traverse the Courses (or run over your friends)</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Mini Games</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Driving Range will be provide different game modes to improve your skills or challenge friends</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Putting Green will provide different game modes to improve your skills or challenge friends</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Tournaments! </strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >These will happen monthly with a range of courses and settings</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Dynamic Environments</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Day and Night modes</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Dynamic Weather (wind &amp; rain)</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Early Access Update (V0.8) Features</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>In Game Course Designer (Sandbox Style)</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Design Courses with the help of up to 3 others locally or online</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Play your Custom maps with your friends by hosting games</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >1 Map Type with a range of assets to design your courses with</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Community Courses!</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Upload your Custom Maps to the Community Database for others to play!</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Download and play Community Designed Maps! </p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Community Maps based tournaments</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Early Access Update (V0.9) Features</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>AI Competitors</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Play against Computer characters with ranging difficulty</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Full Release (V1.0) Features</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Custom Characters</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Create your own character</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Progressions System</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Customize your character</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Golfing</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >As a player, you are given all the tools you need, but must make the decision on what kind of shot (normal, punch, flop, chip), how to shape it (hook, straight, slice), and how hard to hit it. The game will not tell you any more than recommending a club to use. So lineup and take a few practice swings to determine your plan of attack. Practice swings will update the estimated shot trajectory, allowing you to determine if your current approach is going to work. Then it is up to you to replicate your practice swing once addressing the ball. And if you mess it up, hopefully you have one of your Mulligans available to redo it.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1492850/extras/48b9533dbd06fd320192ca4ab0651daa.avif?t=1772125446\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1492850/extras_big/48b9533dbd06fd320192ca4ab0651daa.avif?t=1772125446 width=800 height=456 /></span>  </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > Characters </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Step into the world of Mulligans, where the Aliens have come from outer space to figure out how to teach Humans the incredible game of golf.
