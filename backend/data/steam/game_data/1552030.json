Using features such as a timed night vision camera, or hidden messages displayed by your flashlight, you can get through.<br>Each chapter is unique. The first chapter focused on psychological horror, made to build ambiance and tension. The second chapter will test your stealth. Sneak around the enemies and don’t get caught. The third chapter is a mix of the other two chapters, requiring everything you’ve learned to get through it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Manor</h2>An ever-changing manor, once a hotel in the early 1900s, until an old lady only known as Grandma bought the hotel, and converted it into a home. The long corridors of the hotel still exist, and its empty rooms collect dust. The manor will be the starting place for you, as the player. You'll walk the halls, collecting information on your thesis, taking photos, and eventually... try to escape. The manor is changing as you go along, rooms won't always be the same, so make sure to check everywhere.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552030/extras/beb3984d67b546a275aad4903f6d9d93.avif?t=1613465031\" width=616 height=200 /></span>",
