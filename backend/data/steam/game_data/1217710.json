Under his disoriented state, he meets a young girl by the name of Yukari, a close friend of his who tries her best to ease his troubles. A car accident has brought Kazu here, but Yukari regrets informing him about his mother who's on her death bed. Kazu tries his best to remember anything about his mother, but nothing comes.<br><br>After Yukari leaves, Kazu gets up from his bed and drags himself down the hall to the other hospital room where she lays. The mother's crippled form, the unbreathable atmosphere, and the gentle sound of rain. Slowly, it dawned on him:<br><br>&quot;My mother's about to die. The mother I don't even recognize.&quot;<br><br>Shortly after leaving the hospital, he meets another old friend, Shiori, who also begins to help dispel the bleak and uneasy tension in the air. Kazu decides to go back to school in order to regain his past self. He then meets two new friends by the name of Emily and Saori, but Kazu decides to act as if he's a simple transfer student. Kazu thinks that it would be a good opportunity to get a hobby. He is presented with some choices about whether he should pursue painting, music, or whichever. But there is still one question that is left unanswered:<br><br>Will his mother survive?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1217710/extras/1e2536d8d1bf7ea6594ac5a2c753b366.avif?t=1671491222\" width=600 height=96 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1217710/extras/b586048d464ebbbdbbb1797ccf12475e.avif?t=1671491222\" width=580 height=600 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1217710/extras/bd8f290325e4c4213a4a914203b7b8b0.avif?t=1671491222\" width=596 height=600 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1217710/extras/d0ea5a11c5436e1319245149f54c4a58.avif?t=1671491222\" width=614 height=600 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1217710/extras/043e4e5c38a71c723547f7bf02bdb2fa.avif?t=1671491222\" width=621 height=600 /></span><br><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1217710/extras/c93206ed735de3c0cbb53e5aeb6b0997.avif?t=1671491222\" width=600 height=96 /></span><br><br>Kawaii_Puffin : Project Lead/Writer/Programmer<br><br>KaptivateTV :  Lead Artist/Character &amp; CG Artist<br><br>Cupnunu  : GUI Artist<br><br>Vui Huynh  : Background artist<br><br>Eric Jeffrey Tan : SFX/Music Composer<br><br>Sunnysorayas  : Promotional Video<br><br>Yoko Kitaguchi : Editor",
