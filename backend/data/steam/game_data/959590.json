    "description": "Super Keepy Ups is about one thing: keeping a ball in the air.<br><br>And fish.<br><br>Well it's not really <i>about</i> fish, but there are fish... And technically you need to keep the ball in the water rather than the air... And the ball isn't so much a ball as it is a bubble... And there's basketball too...<br><br>OK, let's try again.<br><br>Super Keepy Ups is about one thing: 1 bubble, 2 fish, a couple of baskets, and an undisclosed number of gravity(s?)*.<br><br>Super Keepy Ups is the debut game from <strong>Super Regular Guy</strong>; born out of a love of keepy ups and a nostalgia for 2 player keyboard-crowding classics such as the Commodore 64's CJ's Elephant Antics, and DOS's Jazz Jackrabbit 2.<br><br>The latest update includes:<br>- The traditional 1 and 2 player local high score mode<br>- The all new basketball mode for 1 or 2 players locally: Beat your own high score or go head to head<br>- Enjoy a remixed, remastered and upgraded adaptive soundtrack<br>- A menu system that is truly part of the game itself rather than a clunky break in play<br><br>Super Keepy Ups has an addictiveness and fluidity that belies it's simplicity, and with Steam Remote Play local doesn't have to mean local anymore!<br><br>Grab a friend, or just grab yourself, and keep that ball from dropping! And remember, Super Keepy Ups is about one thing: getting the highest score you possibly can.<br><br>*Disclaimer: there is only one gravity in this game.<br><br>Oh, and thinking about it, I'm pretty sure the plural for gravity is graviti. Like Octopi.",
