A rag-tag band of nobodies who - quite by accident - represent the kingdom's last hope. <br>With the royal army slain it is they who must venture across the land on a quest to bring back the head of the king's son so that the light might return. If they had a brain cell between them they might actually be dangerous. -The game will have a 2 player co-op system. <br>(Play alone or let a friend join the game to fight side by side with you on your quest.)<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/366180/extras/68af5fc9fa1a7d85b108ee4c0a709a78.avif?t=1770970477\" width=596 height=164 /></span><br>ONCE UPON A TIME, IN A LAND FORGOTTEN BY MANY, LIVED A KING AND HIS WIFE, HAPPILY MARRIED AND LOVED BY THEIR SUBJECTS.<br><br>ON ONE DAY THE NEWSBOY SHOUTED ‘LONG LIVE THE KING AND HIS SON!
