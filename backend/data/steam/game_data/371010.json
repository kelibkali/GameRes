Every sector you visit can present a combat, scavenging, dialogue or trading situation that you will need to decide how to exploit but you only need to stay in a place enough for your hyperspace generator to charge in order to continue the journey.<br>You can give orders in real time to individual ships or using control groups, also they can be ordered to move using three dimensions.",
