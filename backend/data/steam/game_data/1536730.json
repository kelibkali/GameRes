After the end of the horrific pandemic that haunted the early twenties, pharma corps became stronger than ever seen before. Medical research thrived and permitted a multitude of technical advancements, but healthcare prices skyrocketed, causing mass inflation and shifting the entire world's economy. As a result, cryptocurrencies grew in prevalence and eventually gained enough momentum to replace other monetary systems across the globe, but many were left destitute and with nothing. Greed, hatred, envy, and panic then fueled the fires of war day after day, leaving the world scarred and broken. The U.N. has fallen and the war on terror has failed. Civilization is slowly collapsing in on itself. Now, most people cannot afford their necessities. Society is fragmented and has all but dissolved back into a caste division. Crime is at an all-time high and poverty is the new norm. Each day that passes, exploitation of the Earth's resources continues, and pollution intensifies, making life even more unbearable. Humanity is in the darkest place of its entire existence... <strong>A dark place where you exist</strong>.&quot;</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1536730/extras/440aedd61d3f95c2c6134ca092c87477.avif?t=1768583000\" width=184 height=184 /></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1536730/extras/6f83bea1d5062fceef77373a37c887b9.avif?t=1768583000\" width=184 height=184 /></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1536730/extras/24ed52a60b471fb3c8d13208e94395f1.avif?t=1768583000\" width=184 height=184 /></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1536730/extras/0e8540541515fd42e16da1ade3f965e5.avif?t=1768583000\" width=184 height=184 /></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Synopsis:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Buried in debt to a notorious loan shark, you're forced to plunge into the shadows of a dark underworld filled with danger and betrayal around every corner.
