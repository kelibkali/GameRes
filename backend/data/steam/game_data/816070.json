    "description": "The game will be chock full of adventure, brimming with a rich history and enhanced gameplay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBlunt Force will house two simultaneous storylines, the first of which takes place before the war, and will be full of hidden clues and secret information for the player to track down. The second takes place during the war and will be the main shooter mode, split into arcade and challenge. The goal of the arcade mode will be to gun down as many opponents as possible and will feature simplified shooting mechanics, allowing all (even newbies to VR), to fully experience the game. The second shooter mode – the challenge mode – will be more complex and will feature fewer, more difficult to hit targets and a plethora of different weapon mechanics to explore, including manually reloading various weapons and setting off hand-grenades.",
