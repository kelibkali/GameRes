    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >  Advanced Adventures #3: The Curse of the Witch Head</h2>Advanced Adventures #3: The Curse of the Witch Head is a OSRIC(TM) module designed for 4-6 adventurers of levels 6-10.<br>Over two cenuries ago, the Duke Ithinge ordered an underground complex to be built to house the Witch Head and keep it from those who would use its powers for evil. The construction of the complex was performed in a remote and secret place, its chambers and corridors filled with traps and terrors devised by his new court wizard. With the complex completed, the laborers were enchanted to never reveal its location. He knew he could not destroy the Witch Head, for it was forever linked to the vitality of his family line; its power was fueled by the evil deeds of his fore bearers, and it was written in legend that the heir who destroyed the relic would be the last of the line.<br>Last month, good Duke Ymis, received a secret message from a band of outlaw adventurers: the Witch Head had been discovered! The outlaws swore that unless the Duke hands over to them his only heir, his daughter Derica, they would use the powers of the relic to wreak havoc on the countryside and bring his rule to a crashing end. Can a hardy band of adventurers put down the ancient evil or will it rise again?<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Terry Buckingham</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included 2E Compatible ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
