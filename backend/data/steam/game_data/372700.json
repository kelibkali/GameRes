    "description": "The journey begins with four silent protagonists. They go into dungeons, fight <br />\r\nenemies, defeat bosses, and level up. But, is that all there is to their lives? <br />\r\nMeanwhile, in the real world, a group of bored game designers are looking <br />\r\nto bridge the gap between the virtual and real worlds. Will your protagonists <br />\r\nsimply fight respawning enemies for all of eternity or will they achieve <br />\r\ngreater things? (Intended to be part 1 of a trilogy).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis demo allows you to play the first 2 dungeons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures: <br />\r\nFree-turn Stamina Battle System (Mixture of SMT Nocturne and Chrono Cross). <br />\r\nFull recovery after every battle. <br />\r\nSave from menu at any time. <br />\r\n10 Classes to choose from at start of game. You pick a class for all 4 of your starting characters at the beginning of the game (Like in FF1). High replayability value.",
