    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Super Urban Wizard</h2><br>Urban wizard is a silly game series about a gangsta’ wizard fighting the forces of evil<br>to protect his magic bling.  But this time the evil Sowron has stolen it.<br>It’s up to Gundolf the Wizard to take the fight to Sowron, and bust a cap in the A** of Evil!<br><br><br><u>WASD + mouse controls,  </u><br>Earn new weapons, power ups and more between stages, this game features relentless onslaughts <br>of enemies that can at time fill the screen, Use weapons effectively and appropriately to Survive!<br><br><br><br><strong>Tips - </strong><br><br>The “Actual Rail Gun” is a rail gun that fires actual rails, the electromagnetic discharge actually stops enemy bullets and the rounds fired pierce enemies and can hit multiple targets<br><br>The “Reality Ripper” Fires magic anti plasma that homes in on Anyone who isn’t down like a clown, (enemies)  It’s an effective screen clearer but has limited ammo.<br><br>The Friend Maker is all about the friendship, ancient memes be abound!<br><br>All guns are automatic by default to save your clicking hand from carpal tunnel! <br><br><br><br>This game is extremely weird, something that I personally love developing, but is polarizing, people who like it tend to like it a lot, but it’s goofy themes of D&amp;D meets Urban/hiphop culture is, well silly.<br>Certainly not a game to be taken seriously.<br><br>That being said, it is an intense 2d shooter for those with godly reflexes!",
