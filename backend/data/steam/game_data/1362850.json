You play as Chno, a girl who stuck in a realm between worlds where broken shards continue to fall from the titan's labor. <br><br><br>Engage in flying shoot 'em up gameplay which creates the game world below.  Landing on the ground transitions to a fast paced action RPG where you must rely on elemental skill combos to create powerful effects.  Loot obtained from defeated foes is in the form of randomized skill orbs and modifications that can alter those skills.  Boss enemies drop power shards that you can identify to obtain powerful passive and ultimate skills or upgrade currency to further augment your abilities.  Chno also possesses a powerful bracelet that will bring her back from the brink of death, but beware skills orbs obtained will shatter and disappear. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1362850/extras/898d6688ef8048abcf24b026c44dbc86.poster.avif?t=1664337662\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1362850/extras/898d6688ef8048abcf24b026c44dbc86.webm?t=1664337662\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1362850/extras/898d6688ef8048abcf24b026c44dbc86.mp4?t=1664337662\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Rogue-like action RPG in a classic isometric perspective.<br></li><li>Game world that generates depending on the players actions.<br></li><li>Loot randomized skills and mods to create unique abilities.<br></li><li>Multiple upgrade paths for deep character customization.<br></li><li>Story told through hand drawn comic book style cut scenes.<br></li><li>Seamlessly transition between ground combat and shoot-em-up flying.<br></li><li>Create powerful food buffs in place of traditional RPG equipment.<br></li><li>Combat system with blocking, dodging and dashing to suit many playstyles.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1362850/extras/6484bc8d322b5e17724eb137929da068.poster.avif?t=1664337662\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1362850/extras/6484bc8d322b5e17724eb137929da068.webm?t=1664337662\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1362850/extras/6484bc8d322b5e17724eb137929da068.mp4?t=1664337662\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1362850/extras/f5c4cb79df6846214dc4495dbe0d259d.poster.avif?t=1664337662\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1362850/extras/f5c4cb79df6846214dc4495dbe0d259d.webm?t=1664337662\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1362850/extras/f5c4cb79df6846214dc4495dbe0d259d.mp4?t=1664337662\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
