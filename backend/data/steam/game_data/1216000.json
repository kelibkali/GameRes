    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > Sinful Whispers</h2>They tell of a lonely island that bears Great Pele's footprints. An isle seared by a mother's vengeance for the evil wrought on Her eloved children - and where gods smite the earth, only fools dare tread. On the Razor, 'tis folly, indeed, to walk any ground She condemned.<br>Yet still, mortals come. Legends of a secret magic hoard, the fate of a missing whaler, and the strange tale of a lone survivor beckon to shores grown as lush and inviting as a siren't irresistible song.<br>&quot;This way&quot;, encourages a sly whisper adrift on the wind. &quot;Come, and I shall make you mine.&quot; From ruins where once She trod in wrath, the temptations of an ageless evil speak after centuries of silence.<br>Sinful Whisper is a 5th-level adventure of supernatural and psychological horror set on a mysterious island on the Razor Coast grown verdant with time. Here the characters must overcome both their deepest fears and most banal desires to combat a depravity so deep it survived the retribution of a goddess.<br><i> Fantasy Grounds adaptation includes:</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Scaled maps with grids<br></li><li>Encounters<br></li><li>Parcels<br></li><li>Custom tokens for new monsters and NPCs<br></li><li>Reference manual</li></ul><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Michael Potter</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included 5E Compatible ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
