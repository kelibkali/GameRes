    "description": "<strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >GET THE HIGH SCORE....HOWEVER YOU CAN.</h2></strong><br><br>486(pronounced four eighty-six )[/b] is a retro-styled permadeath arcade RPG that throws you into an unfriendly city and lets you figure out how to get the Global High Score. It's like warping back to 1994 with all the gaming knowledge of today.  <br><br>(Why does it look like this? Because the entire game was programmed in QB64!)   <br><br><strong>[CONTROLS]</strong><br><strong>-------------</strong><br>Arrow Keys -  Move Player<br>Esc - Menu<br><br><strong>[RULES / GAME PLAY]</strong><br><strong>----------------------</strong><br>1) The goal is simple: Get the Global High Score.<br><br>What makes it unique is how you go about that. You could drink at the bar to gain rep, go dance at BEAT BEAT EVOLUTION, compete in Tag Arena or beat up everyone you run into. Entirely up to you. Yes, the SCORES ARE GLOBAL so challenge your buddies across the country!   <br><br>2)Time is always against you. You constantly need energy to maintain top speed and food / supplies to stay alive. <br><br>3)Get REP or get DED. Rep is your leveling system and allows you access to new areas and makes you stronger. <br><br>4)Travel wisely. The world is full of dangers, travel smart and well prepared. <br>Stores with X over the doors mean they are not accessible. <br><br><strong>[HINTS]</strong><br><strong>--------</strong><br>It's a good idea to watch the credits.<br><br><strong>SPECIAL THANKS</strong><br><strong>------------------</strong><br>Cover Artist<br>Tristan Young - <br><br>486 Intro Song &quot;June&quot;<br>Ralph Vickers<br><br>Gameplay Music<br>Incompetech",
