    "description": "Venture into the brutal, bloody grindhouse world of Iron Meat. Playing as lone soldiers Vadim and Sasha, you fight against hordes of biomechanical horrors brought on by a ravenous and insatiable entity known as the Meat, it is up to you to try and survive from being totally devoured on an already doomed Earth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBringing back the fast-paced, finger blistering action of 90’s era shooters, use an arsenal of destructive weapons to blast your way through apocalyptic trains, infested secret facilities, and other levels filled with death metal monstrosities of hardware and flesh. The only question left is, what’s hungrier, your will to survive, or the Meat?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDeveloped by Ivan Suvorov, Iron Meat is coming soon.",
