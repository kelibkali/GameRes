We haven't the time here, nor dared to delve into the darkest depths the developer has descended whenst he donned his digital undertaking. Start your adventure today to divine for yourself all the deeds described herein. Then do decide whether the delight known amicably as WAMI is indeed deserving the devotion of a daredevil who dared to download the distraction, the diversion; nay the duality of a demon fueled game known for the duration of decades as WIZARD AND MINiON IDLE",
