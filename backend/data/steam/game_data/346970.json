Players are always free to obey/disobey.  It is always up to players to deal with the consequences of their decisions in the game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You win by bribing and coercing your opponents to do things against their own self interest (and in your interest). </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >If you are being coerced you have only stealth, intelligence, trickery, and creativity to escape.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > OBEY is sort of like <i>Counter Strike Jailbreak Mod</i> meets <i>Spy Party</i>.   </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >OBEY's social aspects have also been compared to <i>Trouble in Terrorist Town</i> and <i>Town of Salem</i>. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >To win, make more money than any one else by the end of the round. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >To make the most money,  take command of the giant robot (the robot player makes 10x more than the other players per second).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You take control of it by walking into a door at the base of the robot.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The player in the robot can easily destroy any player he sees trying to approach (IF he sees them).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >That’s the basics – so superficially, it plays like ‘king of the hill’.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >However...</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Experienced robot players will know that it is not always in their interest to simply kill approaching players.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Why not?

OBEY rewards using <i>TRICKERY</i>, <i>STEALTH</i>, and <i>INTELLIGENCE</i>. <strong>OBEY does not reward constant blind 'guns blazing' rushing to the robot. (But what did you expect? you are a baby bunny .vs an enormous mecha-canon-turret).</strong><br><i>REMEMBER: You will be playing against other human beings - they can not be fooled as easily as AI!</i></p></li></ul>",
