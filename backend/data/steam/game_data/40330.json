The explosion could be heard from as far as 1,000km away. Eye witnesses saw a long object fall from the sky which was illuminated in a blue-white light. A 20km high column of light was followed by a black-mushroom shaped cloud. It has been reported that for the next three nights it was so bright across all of Europe that you could read a newspaper outdoors.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>To date it still remains a mystery as to what happened that day, and now YOU will find yourself immersed in a race against time to uncover a global conspiracy that will carry you to the far reaches of the world. Prepare to have your detective skills challenged like never before in the dark world of cover-ups and corruption.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>80 highly detailed and atmospheric pre-rendered backgrounds<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Atmospheric weather effects (e.g. rain and snow)<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Cinematic full screen videos for intro and cut-scenes<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>25 beautifully rendered 3D characters to interact with<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li></ul>",
