    "description": "VHSoverdose is an unrelenting assault of outlandish action, served up with thick juicy slice of anatomical annihilation! Set inside of the confides of a simple 80's Arcade Machine, VHSoverdose tells the story of a man... with a cardboard box on his head. Discover the secrets of the universe amongst the city's gritty underworld of synthetic drugs, gangs and occasional ultra-violence. Whilst trying to complete a simple task, (Collecting a suitcase). What could be so hard about that? <br><br>Size up your foe, choose your killing tools and plan your strategy of attack because once the insane action starts, your biggest enemy will be the ticking clock. In the non-stop chaos, every second counts and the more enemies you tear apart, the longer your buzz lasts. Your only chance to survive is to use whatever weapons you can get your hands on and recruit some ruthless allies that are tough enough to tackle the enemy onslaught, and maybe you’ll make it through this brutal arcade terror in one piece…<br><br><strong>FEATURES:</strong><br><br><strong>Teamwork:</strong> Recruit ruthless allies of the bathroom raptor cult to help you take down your enemies!<br><br><strong>Dynamic Timer:</strong> Every mission starts the same, you, your medicinal pipe and 30 seconds to get the case and get out.
