    "description": "Majestic Nights is an episodic action-adventure-thriller set in an alternate 1980s where all conspiracy theories, past and present, are True. <br><br>You play as Cardholder: an intelligence operative who may or may not have been present at or even responsible for many of the biggest conspiracy events in history; and Cal, a humble Private Investigator whose own past is shrouded in secrets unknown even to herself. <br><br>With fast, light mechanics, the game has been developed to engross players in a shadowy world of conspiracy with an over-the-top 1980s aesthetic. Players will use wits, stealth and sometimes even a little force to investigate, explore, and acquire ever more clues for their big string-covered wall of conspiracies. <br><br>Season One of Majestic Nights takes place over six chapters, which work as a complete story or as standalone experiences. ‘Chapter Zero’, a prologue to the series, will be made available for free. Each subsequent chapter of the core series will be paid, and season passes will also be available.<br><br>Feature List<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Isometric Action Adventure Gameplay<br></li><li>Real-time stealth and combat mechanics<br></li><li>Investigate and collect evidence to reveal the Truth<br></li><li>Big hair!<br></li><li>A vibrant alternative 1980s setting<br></li><li>A world full of conspiracy theories and government plots where everything you know is wrong<br></li><li>Controller support for platforms including PC, Mac<br></li><li>Nazi aliens!<br></li><li>A gripping, six episode story<br></li><li>Alternate story paths to explore<br></li><li>Puzzles, minigames and more!<br></li><li>Kick-ass original 1980s soundtrack<br></li><li>‘Chapter Zero’, a prologue to the core season, will be available free before launch<br></li><li>More Truth than any other game!<br></li><li>Season Pass will be available on all platforms (and comes with the soundtrack!)<br></li><li>Steam Achievements<br></li><li>Keytars<br></li></ul>",
