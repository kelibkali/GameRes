Starting with a single drone on a rocky ruined world, you will expand across star systems, harvest exotic matter, and construct colossal megastructures that defy the laws of physics.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >UNIQUE MECHANICS</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Each planet is unique, with its own buildings and resources. Harvest magma from a volcanic hellscape, condense deuterium from a gas giant, and extract dark matter from the edge of a black hole.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Design your own production builds using a grid-based module system. Arrange amplifiers, producers, and consumption-reducers to create the perfect engine of efficiency.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Construct many different types of buildings and megastructures. Using detailed hand-drawn and 3D-rendered pixel art, watch as they visually evolve from basic frames to star-encompassing marvels.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Multiple different unlockable mechanics ensure that both active and idle play-styles are viable. Use the kinetic battery to supercharge your building construction with the power of your manual clicks, or automate with advanced paradigm tech and countergains.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Prestige mechanics allow you to reset the universe to increase production. Spend your helix points on a massive branching tree that permanently alters the rules of your game.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4314090/extras/61c69edb14343395c1e939cb5c5bf48e.poster.avif?t=1772102597\" width=452 height=720 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4314090/extras/61c69edb14343395c1e939cb5c5bf48e.webm?t=1772102597\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4314090/extras/61c69edb14343395c1e939cb5c5bf48e.mp4?t=1772102597\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >EXPLORE THE COSMOS, AT YOUR OWN PACE</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Your journey will take you through many distinct star systems, each with their own visual style and resources.
