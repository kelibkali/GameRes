    "description": "<strong>Homeless Simulator</strong> is a homeless person simulator. Homeless persons are those who find themselves living on the streets because of family conflicts, somebody’s fraud, loss of the job or health problems. They are those who need help. It is easy to find yourself living on the streets, but it is practically impossible to get out of such a life without help. The scene of the game is a small town in wintertime. The main task is to survive in those terrible conditions. You have to constantly monitor your body temperature, your hunger and thirst levels, hide yourself from the wind, and find places where you can stay overnight.<br><br><i>Inventory: Tab<br>Interact: E<br>Sleep: N<br>Drag: LMB</i>",
