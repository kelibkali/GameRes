    "description": "In UF: Vampires vs Werewolves you first choose one of the Supernatural factions, like Vampires or Werewolves with the goal of conquering different cities of the world (there will be more factions with upcoming updates). You play a 1v1 real-time strategy battle where you control your units to capture regions of the map. The player will have to manage their resources, and balance early-game aggression via spamming units on board with the late-game combo abilities that can annihilate the units very easily. You will be able to buy buildings in each region changing what kind of resources that region provides you with. In addition to the abilities, units, and buildings the game features lore-rich events that will introduce new characters, and will force you to make difficult decisions that will lead to game changing consequences. The variety in the combination above will make each gameplay unique, and will increase the replayability of the game.<br><br>There will be several maps to choose from, and the player will have to keep in mind the unique features of each map when they try to conquer it. Each faction also has unique Lords, and similar advisors that grant different upgrades in-game influencing the strategy you'll choose to play the game. <br><br><strong>Current Features:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>2 Factions - Vampires &amp; Werewolves<br>  </li><li>3 Cities - Baku, Moscow and Istanbul<br>  </li><li>6 Lords in each Faction<br>  </li><li>5 Units per each Faction<br>  </li><li>24 Advisors<br>  </li><li>Partially unique Faction Buildings<br>  </li><li>Unique Supernatural Abilities</li></ul><br><br><strong>Coming During Early Access:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Co-Op and Multiplayer<br>  </li><li>Custom Scenario Creator<br>  </li><li>Loads of new maps<br>  </li><li>World Map Mode<br>  </li><li>New Lords<br>  </li><li>New Factions<br>  </li><li>New unique Faction Buildings<br>  </li><li>New Supernatural Abilities<br>  </li><li>New Units<br>  </li><li>And much more</li></ul>",
