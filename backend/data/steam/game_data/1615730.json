    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >    D&amp;D Classics: I3-5 Desert of Desolation (1E)</h2>An epic adventure includes the revised Desert of Desolation series plus totally new adventures within Raurin, a desert wilderness set within the Forgotten Realms.<br>A Campaign Adventure for Character Levels 5-10: Deep blue mists of the night swirl over the sands of Raurin, the incomparable Desert of Dust. As the cool night air drains the heat from the sand, you &amp; your friends huddle around your campfire, glancing nervously at the giant pyramid in the distance. Gradually, the winds change direction, bearing a thin streak of white mist toward you from the pyramid. It swirls &amp; takes shape as a faceless man dressed in ancient robes &amp; an ornate head-piece; moonlight shining through his ghostly body &amp; robes, he lifts his arms toward the pyramid &amp; speaks. It was magic that conveyed you all to Bralizar, &amp; an ancient map that guided you through the pass in The Dustwall. But it was, after all, the tales that finally brought you to this place - tales of endless wealth, of spirit-guarded pyramids, of crystalline obelisks, of gemstones with mysterious properties. Now, as the haunted voice of the spectre before you begins his tale, you wonder if the treasure &amp; the quest are worth the price...perhaps your very lives. Are you really the heroes of the prophecies, those who will overcome the foretold tests, &amp; those for whom the treasure awaits? It is time to search your hearts before you venture further into the Desert of Desolation.<br><i>  <strong>    We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today.
