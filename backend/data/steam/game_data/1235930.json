They say a skeletal army lives within its hold, waiting to assault unwary vessels and steal their treasure. In hushed tones, their name is uttered:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1235930/extras/71e04e68ab8af00b5e0ab9ccd9d1fd07.avif?t=1770385005\" width=1232 height=706 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >  Their captain, Skull Queen, has a fearsome reputation as a cutthroat hunter of the seas. She should; she spent a whole lot on marketing to cultivate that image. She also spent a lot on weapons, cannons, clothes, hats, boots, jewelry, couches, and drapes. But most of all, she spent money on her prized ship, “The Coccyx Avenger”.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >In order to support this extravagant lifestyle, the Skull Queen borrowed money from unsavory characters, and now they’ve come to collect. A group of loan sharks, led by the cunning Sharktavia, have The Coccyx Avenger surrounded and are demanding repayment.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1235930/extras/572eba543258d322b652397f9704b885.avif?t=1770385005\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1235930/extras_big/572eba543258d322b652397f9704b885.avif?t=1770385005 width=1560 height=878 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > There is one way out of Skull Queen’s financial predicament: the nearby isle of Catannia.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Catannia is ruled by a wealthy upper class of feline industrialists. Formerly part of an alliance of neighboring islands, the proud citizens of Catannia recently declared their independence as a sovereign nation. Without the protection of the other islands, the considerable wealth stored in Catannia’s treasury makes it a perfect raiding target.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >To save her ship, her career in piracy, and her reputation, Skull Queen must send her crew to infiltrate Catannia, locate its treasury vault, and steal anything that isn’t nailed down.
