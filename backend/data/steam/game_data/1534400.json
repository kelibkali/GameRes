    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Vulgord's Tower Soundtrack</h2><strong>Artist: </strong>LAYR<br><strong>Total length:</strong> 23 minutes<br><br>The Vulgord's Tower soundtrack paints the perfect backdrop to this mystical game of adventure, wizardry, and woe! Allow yourself to be sonically whisked away to a primordial land - rife with conflict and mystery. Each track reveals a new facet of this arcane world. You will experience the misery of the dungeons, the majestic power of the mountains, the glory of conquest and so much more!<br><br>The score was originally written in 2016 by the experimental doom artist, LAYR. This is LAYR's first album deeply rooted in DUNGEON SYNTH and fantasy movie soundtrack genres. The album is gapless and meant to be listened to as one piece of music, just as it is in the game.<br><br>Do not saunter. Your quest awaits. Onward to Vulgord's Tower! Onward to victory!",
