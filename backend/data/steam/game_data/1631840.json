    "description": "The Original Solasta Soundtrack composed Maxime Hervé, this DLC contains 23 tracks (MP3/FLAC) from the game. Maxime Hervé is a talented  young composer who has worked on several high profile projects including Space Hulk: Tactics, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Resident Evil 7, and Love Death &amp; Robots.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSolasta’s game soundtrack is an orchestral score which embraces the fantastic genre and invites the listener to follow the journey of four heroes. From majestic and graceful melodies to heavy battle themes, it is composed with the intention of being part of the heart of the Solasta’s world. The music sometimes takes a stranger and minimalistic approach, giving space to unexpected darker tones.",
