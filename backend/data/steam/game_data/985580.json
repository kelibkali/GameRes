    "description": "This is a fun and mobile pixel pig platformer. The task of the pig is picking up coins at levels, passing extermination of biting dogs and trying not to fall from the ledge down. At each level there is a disabled portal, which will turn on by collecting good enough coins on level. There is only one life for a pig, so be careful. On the other hand, the mumps can shoot, make a double jump even from the wall, and even change color.<br />\r\n The game can be attributed to a rather complex. Therefore, the game provides control from the keyboard as well as from the gamepad for greater convenience in the game.<br />\r\n  ",
