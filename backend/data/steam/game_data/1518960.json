    "description": "Expedition Zero is a survival horror game set in the heart of rural Siberia. As a lone survivor of a Soviet scientific expedition, you will need all of your cutting-edge tech and engineering skills to survive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe unexpected meteorite crash turned the endless Siberian taiga into a nightmare exclusion zone. The military bases went into radio silence, and the locals spread rumors about the obscure flesh-eating creatures lurking in the woods. Expedition Zero, the most advanced Soviet scientific expedition was immediately sent to the zone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany years later, the lone survivor is still trying to find his way home. And deadly frost is not the worst enemy that awaits him.",
