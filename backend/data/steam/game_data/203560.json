    "description": "<strong>Containment: The Zombie Puzzler</strong> is an action puzzle game like you’ve never seen before. The goal of Containment is to surround zombies with survivors of the same color. But watch out for the zombies—they'll fight back by infecting the survivors in the street. Through the game's pulse-pounding campaign and multiple survival modes, you'll use your wits, items you find you along the way, and even the town around you to contain the zombie outbreak.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Not a Match 3</strong> In Containment, you don’t match three of anything—you eliminate zombies by surrounding them with survivor tiles.<br></li><li><strong>These Tiles are Alive</strong> Each tile is a fully animated character that interacts not just with its fellow survivors and zombies, but also with the environment.<br></li><li><strong>Unique Storytelling</strong> There's no time for cutscenes or dialog boxes when the undead are trying to eat you—the story of Franklin County and its survivors is told through in-world text as you make your escape through what's left of the city.<br></li><li><strong>Real-Time/Turn-Based</strong> Containment combines the cerebral strategy of a puzzle game with all the real-time action you'd expect from a zombie attack.<br></li><li><strong>WMD’s</strong> Playing the game well rewards you with useful items that you can use against the zombie horde to devastating effect.<br></li><li><strong>The Environment is Your Friend</strong> Franklin itself becomes a weapon as you knock over signs, power up heavy cranes, and roll cars over zombies.<br></li><li><strong>Boss battles</strong> Yeah, that’s right. We even have boss battles. You haven’t seen zombies like these before.</li></ul>",
