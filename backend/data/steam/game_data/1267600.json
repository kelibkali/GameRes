    "description": "This soundtrack is a mixture of orchestral, electronic and rock music scores from the Gray Zone videogame. As well as the game, this soundtrack is a kind of Early Access version, which means it's not complete. There will be more tracks coming in future chapters of the game story. They will be added in this Original Soundtrack too, which will raise its price each time. Owners of this early version of the Soundtrack will receive all future music scores for free.",
