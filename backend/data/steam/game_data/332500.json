We plan to launch GRAV as Early Access and work closely with the community on how we evolve and move GRAV forward!<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/332500/extras/e9d869695f791a4ffbd89c30f989d2b7.avif?t=1478820787\" width=610 height=148 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >      </h2><br><br><br><i>Note: these are features already in the game.  They may be fleshed out more in the future, but they will be ready to rock from day 1</i><br><br><br><strong>Endless Worlds</strong> - The planets of GRAV are procedurally generated from composite parts.  This allows for a near infinite combination of biomes, alien sites, and dungeons.<br><br><strong>Gorgeous Visuals</strong> - Genre re-defining visuals allow you to experience fear, excitement, and trepidation in a way never seen before.<br><br><strong>Frenzied Combat</strong> - Compared to the zen-like calm of harvesting resources, combat is a wild ride which you can only hope to survive.  Both Melee and Shooting are the tools of death in GRAV.<br><br><strong>Player vs Player</strong> - Create alliances with other players, viciously kill them and take their belongings, or run from it all!  It's up to you how you interact with your fellow players.<br><br><strong>Play With Friends</strong> - GRAV is all about enjoying the experience with your friends. GRAV is client-server based so put up a server or join an official one!<br><br><strong>Powerful Base Construction</strong> - Supporting a modular contextual room based construction system allows for building bases quickly.  GRAV's building system can be used for creating an entire city, a quick base to fight off enemy players, or building an outpost deep in a dungeon to defend against the aggressive hordes. <br><br><strong>Extensive Crafting</strong> - Anything you can harvest or kill has a chance to drop Crafting Materials.  Building everything from the armor you wear, weapons you kill with, to the actual bases themselves comes from crafting.<br><br><strong>Dynamic Environmental Events</strong> - GRAV employs a procedural system to create world events for players.  A night could consist of blossoming night flowers, meteors raining down from the heavens, or even a horde of very angry alien wildlife trying to kill you and anything you have ever made. <br><br><strong>Procedurally Generated Dungeons</strong> - The planets of GRAV are full of dungeons that are created specifically for that planet.  Full of rare resources, dangerous foes, and environmental obstacles that provide a high-risk high-reward play area.<br><br><strong>Hostile Environments</strong> - Alien planets have a combination of semi safe areas and just plain you-are-probably-going to die locations!  The planets of GRAV are places where you must do whatever it takes to survive.<br><br><strong>Roadmap</strong> to get an idea of what features are coming to GRAV:<br>",
