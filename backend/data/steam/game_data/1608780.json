    "description": "<strong>Everpixel Tactics</strong> is a turn-based, tactical, roguelike RPG lootfest set in a dynamic, procedurally-generated fantasy world. Lead a motley crew of mercenaries to greatness - or die trying. Hire samurai penguins, obese unicorns, or spell-flinging mages as you manage your company, go on epic quests, and save your pixelated world.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1608780/extras/aa4803457291946a022b9c4c1e6c99f3.avif?t=1710107805\" width=300 height=300 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Party Management: </strong>Lead a motley crew of fantastical mercenaries - wereslugs, troll knights, human mages, dinosaurs, and more.<br></li><li><strong>Tactical RPG combat: </strong>Experience deep, squad-based combat with brutal injuries. <br></li><li><strong>Fantastic, Pixelated Worlds: </strong>Explore surreal, procedurally-generated, pixelated worlds packed to the brim with fantasy tropes.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A Living, Breathing World:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Explore procedurally-generated worlds that change over time. Watch as accidentally-summoned demons change the land around them into hellscapes, or maniacal mages open portals to other planes of existence.<br></li><li>Magic corrupts the world around it. The dead may rise again in lands of necromancy, while grievous injuries may mend themselves in lands of biomancy.<br></li><li>Embark on epic quests to try to save the world. Seek out and find artifacts powerful enough to shape the world around you - or die trying. </li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Deep, Unrestricted Builds:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Build your mercenaries from hundreds of perks and traits.<br></li><li>Every weapon; every ability they impart, has a time and a place. Hammers penetrate heavy armor, but are difficult to parry with. Swords are great for parrying, but can struggle against heavy armor. <br></li><li>Dozens of spells: Sling fireballs, heal your allies, raise zombies and more.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Fantasy Tropes Galore:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Encounter dozens of monsters each requiring their own strategies to defeat: slimes, dinosaurs, giant penguins, and more.<br></li><li>Ever heard of a werewolf? How about a wereslug? Elves, orcs, and wereslugs - if it's a fantasy trope, Everpixel Tactics probably has it.<br></li><li>Fantastical cultures with their own strategies in combat. Encounter orcs who ride wiener dogs into battle, human knights adorned in heavy armor, and trolls who herd mushrooms. </li></ul><br><strong>About Us:</strong><br>Doom Dino Games is currently a one-man show. I am a professional software engineer that never forgot why I became a software engineer in the first place - I wanted to make great games. Eclectically inspired by games as varied as Diablo 2, XCom, Super Mario, Final Fantasy, Battle Brothers, World of Warcraft, Dwarf Fortress and Baldur's Gate 2, I am passionate about making games that I want to play myself.<br><br>I didn't make this game alone, however. I couldn't have made this game without the brilliant (and ongoing) support from Benvictus and Nyknck.",
