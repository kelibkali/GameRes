For those of you who've been playing PAYDAY games since the first one came out, you know Point Break was one of the heist movies that was the core inspiration for PAYDAY. Bodhi's Pool Repair, anyone? Other than two heists, this DLC comes with a new contact, pistol, 6 songs, 4 masks, patterns, materials and 10 achievements.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/422400/extras/c4bc81631c79c2570f7241e35655072a.avif?t=1756113951\" width=628 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>Introducing Locke</strong> – Born in South Africa, educated at Lincoln Laboratory, trained under MI5, and now employed by Murkywater. Vernon Locke heads their special cyberwarfare division, which has been tasked with infiltrating and destroying . Locke has managed this.

These will prove to be some of the most intense heists the PAYDAY crew have ever done. Bain did the right thing inviting Bodhi to join the crew, as his skills when it comes to larger-than-life heists fits perfectly this time. There are two new heists, Beneath the Mountain and Birth of Sky. Read more about each one below.<br><br>•\t<strong>Beneath the Mountain Heist</strong> – Built deep into granite bedrock, Black Ridge was designed by the Air Force to survive a direct nuclear impact.

He will guide you through it, supplying intel and assets.

Murkywater is a private army with a private air force, and part of that air force is tasked with transporting huge pallets of ill-gotten cash around the world. One such plane is scheduled to fly over the Eastern Seaboard soon. Locke has arranged for you to be on board. Getting the money will be one thing - getting off the plane, that's something else...<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/422400/extras/d2c20cd28548e1d33316ea44be271f07.avif?t=1756113951\" width=628 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>6 New Songs Added</strong> Two all-new heist themes composed Simon Viklund, and four menu themes from the Point Break soundtrack – .<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/422400/extras/47aa975d815d0c548eebb0720695fa3d.avif?t=1756113951\" width=628 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>A New Pistol</strong> – A secondary pistol called the Baby Deagle is added as a part of this DLC.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/422400/extras/0bd8a39021e2d88ca44e797997437157.avif?t=1756113951\" width=628 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>New Pistol Mods</strong> – Several new weapon modifications have been added along with the Baby Deagle pistol.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/422400/extras/200fbf7704cd26a2e59ef7b59f7c73f6.avif?t=1756113951\" width=628 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>4 New Melee Weapons</strong> – How about a Diving Knife, Machete, Ice Pick or even a Selfie-Stick as a melee weapon?
