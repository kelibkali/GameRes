In spite of the minimalist approach, I found the game interesting to look at.</li> <li>That was an amazing game! Interesting music. Good variety and creativity in each level, not to hard but not too easy. It's very engaging, and a good exercise for the mind, never boring in Trial And Terror! P.S. That title is absolutely ingenious. It really is a trial and error game, the &quot;terror&quot; being having to worry about those little moving stars. Great Job!</li> <li>Really enjoyable game! I actually didn't mind the music either, probably because I was concentrating so hard on the actual game. Nice and simple, very challenging at times, not too fustrating and most importantly it is actually do-able without wanting to smash the keyboard in! Good job!</li></ul>",
