Linning</strong> set out to create an RPG that incorporated elements of adventure and horror genres. Soon afterwards <strong>Leandro Tokarevski</strong> joined in to create the pixel art using a palette of only 16 colors resulting in a vibrant and distinct world full of charm. <strong>Towards The Pantheon</strong> is the result of big dreams and two grueling years of hard work. In October of 2017 the prequel game <strong>Towards The Pantheon: Escaping Eternity</strong> was released for free on Steam to great reception.<br>  <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/709510/extras/98ce6ade8daaf9802185925686a66a28.avif?t=1707493734\" width=600 height=104 /></span>",
