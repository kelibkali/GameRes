Change your gameplay with the new Organic pod, fight against new monsters, play with a new hero, build new minor modules, check out the brand new ending sequence, and enjoy full gamepad support! Oh, and did we mention the update was FREE?<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/407210/extras/53a26c5cdb0db2ee163b2202c87fb72a.avif?t=1762448517\" width=616 height=250 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Organic spaceship</h2>Note from sales brochure: ''This pod is an intellectual living creature, so take care of her, like a member of your crew. Remember, she likes red wine, boiled shrimp with sauce, classical music and pictures of kittens.'' <br>The Organic spaceship provides a fresh new gameplay mode with the following rules: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>the powered rooms can't be unpowered / provide X Food per turn / hurt the monsters<br></li><li> the monsters are faster<br></li><li> the modules can't be repaired</li></ul><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/407210/extras/07506071e72b2472ac175facb9e35bfb.avif?t=1762448517\" width=616 height=250 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >New hero</h2>Like all Rosetta models, QV1819 was designed to be the first point of contact with new species during planetary colonization, learning the culture and language of the indigenous people to avoid any potential conflict with the settlers. Acquiring more personality in her AI than other models, QV1819 began referring to herself solely as Rosetta, and felt that her colonists were bringing 'enlightenment to the savages' -- whether the natives wanted them to or not. Fortunately, she seems to be the only one on board with this idea.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/407210/extras/7a0fbddc2a4c8b8193e6ad10b735a2ef.avif?t=1762448517\" width=616 height=250 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >New minor modules</h2>These two new modules are a perfect fit for your Organic pod attempts<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>build the &quot;Biomass Factory&quot; and convert useless dead bodies into useful Industry units<br></li><li> build the &quot;Biomass Cannery&quot; and generate Food units. Anything goes in, Food comes out.

Designed by the community, the Vultuu features 3 elusive monsters that will try to weaken your heroes and modules. One of them will even hide, and drop extra Dust if taken down quickly enough.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/407210/extras/3b84757ffe94a4a66fbf746121c6a6e7.avif?t=1762448517\" width=616 height=250 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >New ending sequence</h2>You've asked for it, we made it!
