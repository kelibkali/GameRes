    "description": "Endless Horizon is a high octane arcade game of speed, precision and perfect timing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChase the neon horizon in jump-ship as you navigate an infinite and ever changing track stretching into the ether, timing your jumps and manoeuvres perfectly to avoid crashing or falling off while attempting to pick up bonuses and powerups.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's more than just potholes that will challenge you on this highway. You must traverse the floating platforms using precision timings to ensure a safe landing. Lightning-speed powerups can help you avoid falling into the abyss, while picking up a magnet powerup assists you in retrieving elusive. These collectibles can be used to unlock other ships which can also be customised. With its distinctive low poly art style, retro 80s-style neon aesthetic, synthwave soundtrack and dynamic level design no two play sessions will ever be the same. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEndless Horizon is a game designed for instant accessibility with straightforward &amp; intuitive controls. Simple use of the keyboard or a gamepad allows the player to control the ship and navigate the course in front of them.",
