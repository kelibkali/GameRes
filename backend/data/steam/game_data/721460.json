As Energy is really complex, Xeno Tech started to work on its functions and try to understand it more its behavior and relationship to the world we all know.<br><br>Xeno Tech’s founder operated long and laborious research to get a better understanding of what he was dealing with.<br><br>After those years of research, Xeno Tech finally reached the goal and decrypted the Energy’s Code. The company then started exploring the time itself to be able to combine both. Xeno Tech was able to start understanding the world more - the parallel and other worlds we live with - time paradoxes - time traveling ...<br><br>This gave the multinational company an enormous power.  Xeno Tech started soon to control the entire city thanks to his own police force...<br><br>To discover this new vast area, Xeno Tech started to develop the T1 armor, to be more specific, it's prototype, as it took several years to make to first armor functional due to a lack of resources.<br><br>The technologic advances are going further, which enables Xeno Tech the possibility to explore more the Energy &amp; Time's Code and Run more experiments. In the laboratories, several tests on human beings, animals, objects, AI started to understand more the impact of time depending on the subject's condition.<br><br>The years passed, Xeno Tech developed the armor T2, T3, and finally T4, this last armor ultimately matched with the requirements and expectations of the company and project.<br><br>In addition to the armor, the first Gun X-159E was created in 2120, this first prototype was one of the predecessors of the current version X-352.<br><br>Now in the year 2143, Xeno Tech finally has the required resources to run the final experience which will impact the entire world.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/721460/extras/431ee86ea574f7335f2cd694c0ee6efc.avif?t=1586628732\" width=616 height=346 /></span><br><br><strong>The Armor</strong><br><br>XenoTech has been working for over 30 years on the development of this kind of Armor. The first model, the “T1”, was the prototype of the actual Armor. <br>The T1 Armor was only able to absorb all kind of chocs - it was designed to offer you body protection. This armor was designed for the big public. It was affordable and could be used by anyone. The second version, the T2 Armor, was designed for businesses. Xeno Tech added physical abilities to help carry heavy loads, get better mobility and make some other aspect of everyday life much simpler.<br>After a few years, the T3 Armor was developed on demand of the army. This Armor was more like a weapon, as it was designed for fight, war, and destruction. Finally, after combining the skills of all armors, Xeno Tech was able to release the last version - the T4 Armor. It was specially designed for Xeno Tech in order to cope with trouble in the city. <br><br>The armor can be customized with special add-ons, such as:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Health Station<br></li><li> BackPack<br></li><li> Propulsor<br></li><li> Energy Shield<br></li><li> Night Vision<br></li><li> Articulation Reinforcement<br></li><li> Neuronal Chip<br></li><li> Reinforcement Plaque<br></li><li> Oxygen Supply</li></ul>",
