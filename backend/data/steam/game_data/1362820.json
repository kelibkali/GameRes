    "description": "'Keysight' is an Unreal Engine powered real-time midi visualization platform aimed at piano/keyboard-focused streamers and video creators. Its purpose is to provide an all-in-one solution to creating exciting, performance-enhancing visuals.<br><br><strong>This program is intended to integrate with an external midi controller (such as a digital piano or keyboard). The demo has a watermark and is locked to ignore 50% of note-on midi events, but otherwise contains full program functionality.</strong><br><br><i>Keysight features hundreds of unique options to customize the look of your content down to the finest detail. Modular particle systems with path behavior control, velocity-driven color blending modes, user-imported custom textures for PBR material set-ups. Sounds intimidating? New color schemes can be generated with an extensive, configurable randomizer instead!</i><br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><br>- Top-down or bottom-up note indicator modes<br>- Full 3D camera<br>- Physically-based materials with user-imported texture support<br>- Modular particle systems with up to 5 configurable slots<br>- 6 color blending modes<br>- Linked or independent colors per dynamic object<br>- Basic or Advanced menu modes<br>- Randomizer with 112 configurable chance branches to generate new color schemes<br>- Comprehensive statistics for note presses<br>- ... and much more!",
