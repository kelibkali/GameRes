    "description": "<strong>RODINA</strong> is a dream.<br><br>A shared vision of a massive, seamless universe to explore. The perfect <strong>immersive space sim</strong>, where you can go anywhere, do anything, become anyone.<br><br>I started RODINA because I suspected that no company could ever achieve this dream in a AAA way. I thought that perhaps a single developer, working over a long time frame, could eventually build something great.<br><br>Join me on this adventure - <strong>try the DEMO</strong> and consider supporting further development!<br><br>Rodina is made mostly by a single, obsessed developer - a 10-year veteran of the games industry who previously worked at <strong>Bethesda Softworks</strong> on <strong>Oblivion</strong> and <strong>Fallout 3</strong>.

I can't make any promises about where or how long Rodina will go (and I ask you to buy only based on what you see here now), but I <i>can</i> promise to keep working on Rodina for as long as I'm able to. I'm committed to making Rodina great, and I hope that what's already released shows that I'm capable of delivering something <strong>different, vital, and fun</strong>.<br><br>Please <strong>try the demo</strong>, and if you like what you see and pick up the full game, all your money will go towards Rodina's future development!",
