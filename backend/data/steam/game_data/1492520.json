You will have to control where your resources are diverted to and ensure that there are enough workers to fulfill your missions. Don't be fooled by the simple and stylized look of Malmyr - The game is getting very complex, very fast.<br><br>12 magical runes enable you to make your buildings more efficient. The functionality of the Runes was heavily expanded with the Runemagic 2.0 patch. New ways to use and comine the runes to a total of 18 runewords will allow new strategies for the hardest missions Malmyr has to offer.<br><br>You are sent to the forgotten lands of Malmyr by your King to expand the kingdom's territory and exploit Malmyr's precious ore deposits. While doing so you find out about the sinister fate of the Dwarves that once inhabited the continent. You will have to protect the kingdom from suffering the same!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1492520/extras/steamBanner2.png?t=1635609485\" /></span><br><br>About us:<br><br>We are two very passionate german devolpers who always wanted to make games. We decided to take a leap of faith and go for it. When buying this game you should keep that in mind. Malmyr is made with great love for detail and we hope that we can offer unique challenges with each mission, but it cannot offer hundreds of hours of playtime like bigger games with actual funding and a budget can.<br><br>While we cannot promise to expand the game's content and currently have no plans to do so beyond Runemagic 2.0, we will continue to improve the game and fix bugs. Ziegler gamedev has the vision &quot;Making dreams come true&quot;. We feel that part of that also is making the best game we can for our players.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1492520/extras/steamBanner3.png?t=1635609485\" /></span><br><br>Mamlyr is...<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Inspired from games of our past and present - Like The Settlers, Anno and Factorio.<br></li><li> 12 story based missions - You need to find a good strategy to complete them and handle the hazards thrown at you.<br></li><li> Unique obstacles and ambience for missions - Each mission was made to give you a different experience: Sometimes more relaxing, sometimes more challenging than the previous one.<br></li><li> Complex production chains - They will get longer and will need a wider variety of resources to function.<br></li><li> A different take on resource transportation - You will not just connect buildings with a road, set up a transportation route or build conveyor belts.
