    "description": "&quot;Hold my Beer!&quot; those famous last words before someone does something incredibly stupid.<br><br>This is a ridiculous game where you play the role of an idiot, doing idiotic dares and stunts.<br>I don't recommend trying this at home, but since we'll be doing it in virtual reality, go right ahead!<br><br>You choose the difficulty based on how much of your beer you drink. If you somehow manage to succeed in your task, you get to drink more, and try an even more daring version of the stunt. Your final score for any dare is a combination of points, time, and how much you drink.<br><br>There are three unique dares in total.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/672020/extras/79ef239e8efdc117ede13cbcf818059b.avif?t=1510194952\" width=624 height=133 /></span><br>&quot;Idiot Crossing&quot; is a dare where you must cross a busy street using a walking frame.
