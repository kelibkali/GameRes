    "description": "Errant Kingdom is a queer, high-fantasy visual novel for PC, Mac &amp; Linux, brought to you by Lunaris Games, a tiny team of five indie developers. <br><br>After a long delay and porting the game to a different engine, we have now finished releasing the final version in its entirety. Errant Kingdom contains approximately 590,00 words and over 60 CGs in total. Errant Kingdom has also now been brought out of early access.<br><br>The Kingdom of Novus has been thrown into disarray, and it's up to you to decide if you’ll help to bring peace, or if you’ll stoke the fires of chaos. Enter a high fantasy world steeped in political intrigue; where magic touches the land and blood turns the wheels unseen. Dishonor &amp; betrayal. Hope &amp; despair. Pick a side, and meet your match.<br><br>Errant Kingdom is a story with darker elements at play. As a denizen of the kingdom of Novus, you're at the heart of watching history unfold before your eyes. Whether you see its rise or fall, however, is up to you. There are those who will help you in your endeavors along the way, and might even find themselves enamoured with you. Though, it is also possible to earn their ire should your plans be devious. Only you will influence how the story evolves, and the most important moves to make are yours, and yours alone. <br><br>Errant Kingdom features three playable protagonists (with no fixed protagonist portrait, leaving players free to imagine their character as they see fit) and eight potential romance routes (six individual, two polyamorous). You can also play the game without romancing anyone and it will not affect your experience in any way. <br><br>If you choose to purchase the game in its unfinished state, your purchase will give you access to the download of the Prologue and Chapters 1-5. When the final, complete version of the game releases in December, you will receive this as a free update. We have no in-game purchases, and this one-off cost will give you access to a potential 240+ hours of gameplay when taking into account our 8 romance routes, our no romance play-through, and our three different MC roles. <br><br>Each play-through has the potential to be vastly different, depending on your choices, your actions, and the way you interact with those around you!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Features</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Three unique character routes; The Knight, The Ambassador, and The Nomad<br></li><li> Six individual romances &amp; two polyamorous romances<br></li><li> LGBTQA+ cast<br></li><li> Choose your own pronouns <br></li><li> Option to pursue romances without sexual content, or to play without romancing anyone at all</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Love Interests</strong></h2><br>Errant Kingdom has a LGBTQA+ cast of love interests, each with their own unique backgrounds and intertwining stories. You will begin the game as merely an acquaintance, but as the story progresses you will have the chance to spend time with each of them. Eventually, if you choose a romance route, you will become exclusive with one (or two, if polyamorous options are selected) of our love interests, and will gain access to special scenes, CGs, and conversations.  <br><br>All six love interests are romanceable individually, and our polyamorous relationships are Lucien &amp; Raiden, and Maja &amp; Erik. Roux is asexual, and Livia is demisexual. Our story is linear, so once a romance is selected, you will still interact with all of our other cast members! We're trying to bring an RPG style of gameplay to the Visual Novel world, and this is one of the elements we're most passionate about executing well.",
