He bought out a sand mine in South Carolina and built a new facility on top of it. In the mid-1960s, a Vietnam war veteran by the name of Razi Imani is asked to come to the South Carolina facility for testing. Having been medically discharged from the military after losing a leg to a landmine, Aperture designed a prosthetic for him and wanted him to test it. Shortly after being put into animated suspension, the Senate hearings on missing astronauts forced Cave to immediately shut down the South Carolina branch to keep from going bankrupt. </p>",
