It takes place in the middle 2000s in Eastern Europe, and among our team, we usually discuss it as &quot;GTA+KRZ weird slav kiddo&quot;. I also really love the short description that's placed above this text, and I won't feel bad for repeating it here:<br><br>&quot;Be a heist driver, smuggle drugs, avoid police, gamble at illegal fight club, meet disgusting people and look for a lost cargo in the middle of nowhere in an open-world neo-noir adventure that tells a story of two thugs working for an Eastern European crime syndicate.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1546890/extras/180b0a3160cfdbb8f0fb20d700b09fc9.poster.avif?t=1728498730\" width=620 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1546890/extras/180b0a3160cfdbb8f0fb20d700b09fc9.webm?t=1728498730\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1546890/extras/180b0a3160cfdbb8f0fb20d700b09fc9.mp4?t=1728498730\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >GAMEPLAY</h2><br>You’re a driver - so you drive. You’re a driver for a crime syndicate - so you have a gun and you often get involved in drug trafficking and other shady business normal people usually don’t do. You’re involved in the shady business - so you don’t want to get close with the police. In fact, you don't want to get close with anyone you meet and talk regularly, as they also mostly do shady business and have a complicated moral compass (though it’s usually not as complicated as yours).<br><br>It's simple, you'll quickly get used to it.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1546890/extras/c6bd9d68fc0aee91ff9923c93aad8e46.poster.avif?t=1728498730\" width=620 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1546890/extras/c6bd9d68fc0aee91ff9923c93aad8e46.webm?t=1728498730\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1546890/extras/c6bd9d68fc0aee91ff9923c93aad8e46.mp4?t=1728498730\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >STORY</h2><br>A few weeks ago, a truck loaded with heroin left the dock of Karpov, but disappeared before reaching its destination somewhere in the middle of two cities. It was later found robbed, with all guards dead and no clues to follow. <br><br>The syndicate assigned you to escort the next shipment and sent you an old pal as a wingman.<br><br>How did it happen that now you are standing in the middle of the night forest in the Karpov region, observing the corpses of the driver and guards of the truck, the empty body of the car, and not a single trace of the thieves? How did it happen that it was ambushed, while only you and the onboard crew knew which route it would take?<br><br>These events will mark the beginning of a long story. Right now you shouldn't hesitate - the road is waiting, we have a missing cargo to find.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1546890/extras/c14eda93debbde66565cc84a8af8bea7.poster.avif?t=1728498730\" width=620 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1546890/extras/c14eda93debbde66565cc84a8af8bea7.webm?t=1728498730\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1546890/extras/c14eda93debbde66565cc84a8af8bea7.mp4?t=1728498730\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
