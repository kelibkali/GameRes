    "description": "The main idea of the game is a fantasy alternative to Valhalla. Scandinavian mythology is a thematic focus - the same style, ornaments and atmosphere where heroes fight for a place in eternity, there will be only one.<br><br>This is a world of magic and tactics.<br><br>Style - handpaint.<br><br>Battle Royale PVP fighting game with strategy elements.<br><br>On a small one map, from 2 to 6 players fight at the same time, who are divided into equal teams. Fast matches have a maximum duration of 10 minutes, so the maps are not big, but well designed for energetic battles with fun running around the map in the heat of magical effects.<br><br>Each map has all 4 times of year, all are available on the same map to increase variability.<br><br>At the end of each match, there will be a unique anti-cheat system based on feedback and ratings of players for the subsequent successful formation of the effective teams.<br><br>Before the battle, players appear in a room where they have 30 seconds to equip and buy clothes, weapons, bottles and recharge abilities.<br><br>There is an interaction with the environment in the form of teleports and places of interest (landslides, lava, waterfalls, lightning, tornado) that block the way and can inflict damage on the opponent. <br><br>The tactic is to activate the character selection circle (menu wheel) via a hotkey for the interaction: for enemies - magic, weapon strikes or debuffs; for allied characters - useful buffs, damage resistance, acceleration, healing etc.<br><br>There is a teleport on the map with an 5 sec activation delay, the next character can only be passed with the same delay. There is always some kind of artifact there, which you can use in this or in the next game only once.<br><br>There will be several characters in the game, including:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Viking - tank, human shield;<br></li><li>Archer - long-range and dodger, slows down the shot, can damage with arrows;<br></li><li>Mage - steals lives, debuffer, can teleport objects and one character;<br></li><li>Forest gnome - healer, buffer, support.</li></ul><br>After the end of the fight, in addition to experience, which unlocks many different abilities, and in addition to game currency to unlock new weapons and elements of armor, there is also the opportunity to upgrade a room with weapons (fireplace, sparring partner, sofa, bar etc).",
