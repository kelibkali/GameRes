    "description": "Do you already consider yourself to be a SimAirport Frequent Flyer?  Then the <strong>Frequent Flyer Pack</strong> may be the perfect way for you to make it truly official - consider stepping up to <strong>Platinum Diamond Gold Status</strong> today!  <br><br>Here's what you get when you step up to Platinum Diamond Gold Status with the <strong>SimAirport Frequent Flyer Pack</strong>:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Your Name</strong> in the Game!</h2>Hundreds of thousands of passengers traverse through SimAirport every single day.  This is your chance to be one of those passengers, for everyone!  Your name, on a passenger, for everyone &amp; forever.<br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Total of <strong>19 Exclusive New Objects</strong></h2>Jazz up your international terminals &amp; provide a fresh view to your regional hubs.  The Frequent Flyer Pack brings you 19 exclusive new objects and variations, all captured in the highest of quality.  There are numerous new decorative bushes and trees, three awesomely modern sculpture pieces, several new combo bench-decoration objects, and more!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Terms of Carriage - The 'Fine' Print</h2>Enrolling in the Platinum Diamond Gold Status DLC Pack entitles you to two primary benefits:<br><ol><li><strong>Name in the Game</strong>  <br>The opportunity to set the name for a passenger, immortalizing yourself in SimAirport, forever.  Please note however that all submitted names must be all-ages friendly and require review by LVGameDev prior to being 'live' for everyone.  After purchasing, you can submit the name for your passenger from an interface within the game.  Please allow 2-3 business days for review;  once approved, everyone's game will contain your submission and your passenger will likely traverse the halls of airports throughout the world on a daily basis!<br><br></li><li><strong>19 Exclusive All-New High-Quality Objects</strong><br>You will have access to 19 all-new high-quality objects.  The additional content that Frequent Flyers receive consists of high-quality objects and object variations -- with the focus being primarily on aesthetic in nature, though some new variants contain new &quot;combo&quot; functionality (i.e. benches with planters, providing environment boost &amp; passenger sitting places). <br><br></li><li><strong>Supporting SimAirport &amp; LVGameDev</strong><br>Becoming a Platinum Diamond Gold Status member isn't <i>only</i> about immortalizing yourself in SimAirport forever -- it's also not simply about having the best looking airport (though that <i>is</i> important, too!).  It's equally as much about supporting us, the small team behind the game, and in turn expressing your support for SimAirport itself by expressing your interest &amp; desire for additional content.  For those who wish to do so (and <i>please</i> don't feel compelled to do so), this is a fantastic venue for it;  and if it's not your thing, we understand that too!  <br><br>Those of you who often tune into our Dev Streams, or even just dropped by occasionally, you probably know our general feeling on DLC -- that said, we're giving this a try and we'll see what happens.  You can expect updates to continue for the base game (with or without becoming a Frequent Flyer) for as long as we can reasonably do so.  <br><br>SimAirport is the game that we wanted to play as kids &amp; there's still more we want to make happen in the game.  :)<br></li><li><strong>Thank you!</strong><br>If you've read this far, you're probably a supporter already, even if you decide not to immediately step up to <strong>Platinum Diamond Gold Status</strong> today!  <br><br>No matter how you may show your support -- whether it's leaving a review, sending in QA-team-quality bug reports, providing highly-detailed idea documents, or helping out new players &amp; members of the community on the forum.   These things all happen, some on a daily basis even;   it's truly far more than we ever expected or imagined.  We really cannot even begin to express our gratitude for the level of engagement and overall support that we continue to receive.   <strong>Massive Thank You -- to the entire Community!</strong></li></ol>",
