    "description": "The Supermarine Spitfire is a legendary example of British aircraft engineering and one of the best fighter aircraft of WWII. It flew in Europe, Africa and the Pacific. The first Spitfire Mk.Vs were upgraded from earlier I and II models and were operational in early 1941. A total of 6,641 airframes were produced. More than a hundred of RAF squadrons used Mk.Vs and they were also sent to British dominions and used by other Allied countries. The VB modification was equipped with the Merlin 45 or 46 engine (the latter was better suited for higher altitudes), two 20mm cannons and four 7.7mm machine guns. 143 of them were given to USSR and saw action in the skies of Kuban during Spring 1943.<br><br>In addition to Quick Mission Builder and Multiplayer modes, you can fly it in Career mode during <strong>Battle of Kuban</strong> timeframe.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/894700/extras/5094ebf9e51f0d32a5a46e18e1b3e120.avif?t=1734535103\" width=424 height=212 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Armament: two 20mm guns &quot;Hispano Mk.II&quot;, 60 rounds per gun, 650 rounds per minute and four 7.7mm machine guns &quot;Browning .303&quot;, 350 rounds per gun, 1150 rounds per minute.<br></li><li>Length: 9.2 m<br></li><li>Wingspan: 11.21 m<br></li><li>Wing surface: 22.48 m^2</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Modifications</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Merlin 45 engine best suited for lower altitudes<br></li><li>Rearview mirror (1 kg weight increase, minor speed loss)</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Skins</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Standard pattern.<br></li><li>Early type A camo of 'Dark Earth' and 'Dark Green' upper surfaces and 'sky' underside, used until August 1941.<br></li><li>Desert Scheme of 'Dark Earth', 'Mid-Stone' upper surfaces and 'Azure Blue' underside.<br></li><li>Spitfire #EP210 number 538 from the 3rd squadron of 57th GIAP, airfield Popovichevskaya, April 1943.<br></li><li>Spitfire #EN951 RF+D of No 303 (Kosciusko) Squadron flown by Sqn Ldr Jan Zumbach, Kirton-in-Lindsey, September 1942.<br></li><li>Spitfire #W3312 QJ+J 'Moonraker' flown by Sqn Ldr James Rankin, No 92 Sqn, August 1941.<br></li><li>Spitfire #BL255 MD+T 'Buckeye-Don' flown by 1st Lt Dominic 'Don' Gentile, 336th FS, 4th FG, 8th AF.<br></li><li>Spitfire #BM324 GW+S No 340 Sqn 'Ile-de-France' (Free-French), flown by Cpt Bernard Dupérier, August 1942.<br></li><li>Spitfire #BL287 XR+C, flown by  Pilot Officer Leo Nomis, No 71 Eagle Squadron, Martlesham Heath, Suffolk, England, April 1942.<br></li><li>Spitfire #AB910 AE+H of No 402 (Canadian) Squadron, Horne, early June 1944.<br></li><li>Spitfire JU+E of 111 Sq flown by Sqn Ldr G.F.

It is neccessary to turn the automatic governor off to set the boost value to +16.<br></li><li>Engine has a single stage mechanical supercharger which does not require manual control.<br></li><li>Engine is equipped with an automatic fuel mixture control which maintains optimal mixture if mixture lever is set to the forward position. To use automatic mixture leaning to reduce fuel consumption during flight move the mixture lever to backward position.<br></li><li>Engine RPM has an automatic governor that controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.<br></li><li>The water radiator is operated manually, while the oil radiator is unadjustable.<br></li><li>Aircraft has a neutral static stability. The elevator effectiveness is high, so the aircraft should be controlled carefully, not giving too much flight stick input.<br></li><li>Aircraft becomes unstable with extended landing flaps.<br></li><li>Aircraft is equipped with elevator and rudder trimmers.<br></li><li>Landing flaps have a pneumatic actuator so they can be extended to maximum position only. Speed with extended landing flaps is limited to 150 mph.<br></li><li>Airplane tail wheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. Since the landing gear wheels are relatively close to each other, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.<br></li><li>Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with the shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.<br></li><li>Airplane is equipped with a siren that warns a pilot if the throttle is set to a low position with the landing gear retracted.<br></li><li>It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.<br></li><li>Airplane is equipped with upper and bottom formation lights which can be turned on simultaneously or independently.<br></li><li>The gunsight is adjustable: both the target distance and target base can be set.<br></li><li>The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter.</li></ul>",
