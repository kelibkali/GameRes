    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>DeepStates [VR]</strong> - Experiences designed to calm your mind and drift away. </h2>Wind down in compelling natural environments with dense atmospheres. Let the scenery sink in and whenever you are ready activate the DeepGuide, which uses breathing, humming, spatial sounds and entrainment with brightness-, volume- and haptic modulation, as well as binaural beats to get you deep. After a guided session aspects of the environment and mood will have transformed.<br><br><br>After choosing an environment <strong>(the DEMO contains only 1 environment)</strong> you can explore it using teleport or smooth locomotion. In each environment you can control certain parameters (e.g. time of day) using your thumbsticks / trackpads. Additional controls for image, sound, locomotion, performance, as well as settings for the DeepGuide (e.g. session length, manual or fixed guided tempo) can be accessed via the radial menu. There you will also find additional information regarding the specific controls for each environment and its modes. The application knows three modes: Default, DeepGuide and Afterglow.<br><br>For further information and link to the Discord channel, please check out the main game's store page.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong><u>Developer's note</u></strong> (Marc Zimmermann aka. epicscapes):</h2>In DeepStates [VR] I combine my passion for using enviroments to convey feelings and emotions, with my interest in the manifold realm of altered states of mind. For this application I create places that I personally have a strong longing for and which tend to give me this certain vibe, a mixture of 'the joy to be alive here and now' and a feeling of 'melancholia', since all of it will come to an end eventually. <br>My goal is to create interesting, soothing and deep, meaningful states of being. <br>I dearly hope that these experiences will provide value for you and enrich your palette of being.",
