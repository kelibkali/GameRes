Guts. Our own meat.<br>Here are the Great Ancients sleeping in each of us.</h2><br>Should we fear imaginary monsters, or creatures crawling out of the depths of the sea? After all, they are only the wretched of this world.<br>The unknown and fleshy within us - is the true, underlying horror of which we may not even be aware. A horror about to break free...<br><br>Visceratum draws inspiration from the work of those who have been able to look into the abyss of humankind. Let's honor those names: Lovecraft and Kafka, Beksiński and Giger; Cronenberg, Švankmajer, Lynch. And many other masters of the dark arts gave a bit of their energy to the seed from which Visceratum sprouted. However, the game does not try to parasitize on the greats - by paying tribute to them, it seeks to construct its own reality.<br><br>The strange visuals, сrawling at the bottom of the &quot;uncanny valley&quot;, combining serious themes and drama with outright absurdity - create a special surreal atmosphere of Visceratum. Will you dare to step into these dark waters?",
