Not as a visitor, but as an investigator.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>CULT OF THE SONS</strong> is a psychological horror game designed to apply constant pressure on the player. It deliberately avoids traditional action mechanics and focuses entirely on perception, memory, and decision-making under stress.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Your objective is simple:<br><strong>Survive ten rounds. Stop the cult.</strong><br><strong></strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>CUSTOMIZABLE</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >We want everyone to have fun.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >That's why you can choose whether you want monsters and jump scares before starting the game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You can also adjust the difficulty level.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Atmosphere and Action</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The manor is not a static environment.<br>Rooms change, objects disappear or reappear in different locations. Sounds, lighting, and details often feel subtly wrong just enough to create doubt.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The game demands careful observation and trust in your own memory. Failure is rarely caused by slow reactions, but by hesitation and uncertainty.<br><br>High-Variability Anomaly Gameplay</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Every round unfolds differently:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Randomly occurring anomalies</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Unpredictable events</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Changes that only become apparent after multiple playthroughs</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >There are no fixed routines and no reliable patterns. What you learn in one round may be useless in the next.<br><br>Constant Threat</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The house is not empty.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Creatures observe, follow, and react to your behavior. Some are clearly visible, others remain in the background. Not every threat announces itself and not every encounter can be avoided.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Jumpscares are present</strong>, but used deliberately and with restraint.<br><br>Tactical Glowstick System</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The player is given a deliberately limited tool:</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Green Glowsticks</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Mark seemingly safe areas</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Assist with orientation and comparison</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Red Glowsticks</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Mark suspicious zones</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Serve as a personal warning system</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >If an area is marked inconsistently, the newer marker replaces the previous one.<br>The system supports perception it does not provide safety.<br><br>Difficulty as a Core Design Principle</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>CULT OF THE SONS</strong> is not designed for casual play.</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Ten consecutive rounds</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Noticeably increasing intensity</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Growing psychological pressure</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The game is built to provoke mistakes.
