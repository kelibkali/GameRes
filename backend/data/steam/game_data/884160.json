    "description": "Experimental minimalist game with a special graphical mecanic.<br />\r\nThe whole experience is supposed to let you focus on your targets. Allowing you to improve your skills without artifices.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe gameplay is really about fast paced old FPS but with smaller targets and some kind of puzzle to understand and challenge the graphical mecanic.<br />\r\nLevels are mostly maze generated with procedural generation.",
