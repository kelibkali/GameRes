Or almost. You play as a soul who just disembodied by accident and needs to do everything to keep his body alive until the rescue arrives. The intrepid soul must learn to exploit his environment and gather resources, such as food and medicine, in order to survive. But you need to run, because if you start wandering around, your body won't make it.<br><br>And staying alive may be as hard as life itself! There's so much to do in order to keep your body safe. And there's no hand holding. After all, you can't hold a ghost by the hand.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1489150/extras/1da3cfc88df17093408a9edbf7615b31.apng?t=1647367640\"><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1489150/extras/1da3cfc88df17093408a9edbf7615b31.poster.avif?t=1647367640\" class=\"bb_img\" width=615 height=210 /></picture></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1489150/extras/495ae5a272dcf61f86bfa6d0035942c3.webp?t=1647367640\" width=212 height=33 /></span><br><br>Are you keen on survival games, but don't have enough time to play complex games that require hours of dedication to advance?<br><br>Don't Give Up is a challenging run casual survival game for those looking for an approachable experience, but still as hard as you'd expect for a game of the genre, and still presents you with a narrative that will make you reflect on the relationship between the life and death.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1489150/extras/32c1e9490b27ef701930da99d05764e4.apng?t=1647367640\"><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1489150/extras/32c1e9490b27ef701930da99d05764e4.poster.avif?t=1647367640\" class=\"bb_img\" width=615 height=210 /></picture></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1489150/extras/4bbc61496a41d2309656d93ca3efd50c.webp?t=1647367640\" width=289 height=33 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Really hard run survival experience with no hand holding.<br></li><li>Casual and approachable survival game, but equally challenging as well.<br></li><li>Items to craft, resources to manage, enemies on the prowl and various hidden secrets to be unveiled.<br></li><li>Beautiful and whimsical pixel art visuals: cute and creeppy 2D characters inhabiting a unique lost wood.<br></li><li>Original Soundtrack.<br></li><li>Charismatic characters and a narrative that will make you reflect on the relationship between life and death.</li></ul><br>And don't forget to join our Discord server to be up to date with the development of our games, meet the developers and have early access to screenshots, videos and demos of your future projects!<br>",
