    "description": "<strong>Super Novel Collector</strong> is a 2D Platform game built for speedrunning. It has an in-built timer that automatically tracks splits at the end of each level. You can try to complete the game as fast as possible or just play casually. <br><br>The 50 levels in the default level set provide a compelling challenge, but by entering a different code on the title screen an infinite number of 50-level sets can be randomly generated. The same code will always generate the same level so you can easily race against others.<br><br><strong>The story:</strong><br><br>Super Novel Collector is about Xander, a descendant of the last librarian of Alexandria - the man who is rumoured to have started the fire that destroyed the most complete literary collection in human history. Xander seeks to set things right and restore the library to its former glory. <br><br>You must jump, dodge, hack and slash your way to the top of the tower and touch the book to finish the level. Collect 50 books to finish the game. If you die you are moved back to the start of the level, but the level is not reset. The level can be completely reset at any time by pressing R.",
