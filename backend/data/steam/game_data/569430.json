    "description": "Sometimes you have to commit yourself to achieve something in life,you need to sacrifice yourself for the greater good, and triumph over all barriers between you and that goal. My name is Daniel. I used to live a normal life... I had a decent job, a beautiful wife... but everything changed, and now I have to get her back and save myself in the process. I'm ready to go to the deepest corners of hell if I have to, if it means I get to see her again.<br>The plot may seem to be simple and somewhat cliché, however we ensure you that there will be a level of depth beyond the generic indie horror game story. For fans of games with deep, well thought out stories, you will not be disappointed.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/569430/extras/30e64698e0019ec3a4557a253b1a05f2.avif?t=1763389361\" width=250 height=98 /></span> <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Areas</strong><br>You will explore a variety of areas, each one vast and full of its own secrets.
