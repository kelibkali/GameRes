    "description": "The journey continues: the first add-on for the popular Fernbus Coach Simulator features the <strong>Neoplan Skyliner</strong>! This “King of the Road” is a special luxury coach in the real world and of course in this simulation.<br><br>The double-decker bus in this DLC comes with the original FlixBus painting and other designs. The virtual driver operates from an interactive cockpit modelled in high detail, featuring various camera perspectives. This is the place where all features of the bus can be controlled – including large dashboard displays, a driver monitor with navigation and rear view camera, controllable air conditioning and extensive controls of the harmonic interior and exterior lighting concept.<br><br>Additionally, the Neoplan Skyliner is fitted with a lifting system as well as interactive doors and luggage compartments which can be opened and closed individually. An original Skyliner was available for sound recordings leaving this virtual model with nothing to be desired for when compared to its real-world counterpart. And of course, this luxurious double-decker can be repainted by you via the Steam Workshop.<br><br>The Fernbus Coach Simulator Add-on <strong>Neoplan Skyliner</strong> sets new standards – making it the absolute highlight of every Coach fleet!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/569700/extras/197ee8fc0038e10efd62f4eb86f08c16.avif?t=1726492447\" width=616 height=218 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Original Neoplan Skyliner double-decker bus with official FlixBus design<br></li><li>Includes 7 other FlixBus designs<br></li><li>Detailed, interactive cockpit with extensive functionality and various camera perspectives.<br></li><li>Usable air conditioning<br></li><li>Driver monitor with navigation and rear view camera<br></li><li>Lifting system<br></li><li>Extensive lighting system, interior and exterior<br></li><li>Usable driver windows and sun shield<br></li><li>Interactive controls for door and luggage compartment<br></li><li>Reactive displays<br></li><li>Original sounds<br></li><li>Repaintable via Steam Workshop</li></ul>",
