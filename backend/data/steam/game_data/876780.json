There are two teams which fight over the premise of having more terrain area than the other team. Each kill covers a portion of the other team's territory which gradually increases throughout the match.  <br>  <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/876780/extras/1b0d938aea066a2eab264c2469c0422c.avif?t=1582280991\" width=616 height=154 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> To counteract and protect yourself from getting killed, you put down crates. With time, you unlock different presets which help you build complex structures faster.<br></li><li> When getting killstreaks with the Archery class, you get arrow upgrades: splash damage arrows, lighting arrows and more!<br></li><li> On the other hand, with the tank class, you get other class specific power ups when your killstreak gets higher such as extra shields and speed. <br></li><li> Make great use of powerups to increase your chances of winning!<br></li><li> Each class has an important gameplay role which can change the flow of a match.</li></ul>  <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/876780/extras/092c832b46385ece2901460d7133a621.avif?t=1582280991\" width=616 height=154 /></span><br>Four different maps you can play on:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Aztec Jungle<br></li><li> Sakura Season<br></li><li> Frosty Winter<br></li><li> Antique Desert</li></ul>  <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/876780/extras/5b729d6429a9c16c1b6de339be23b8d9.avif?t=1582280991\" width=616 height=154 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Parties: play with your friends!<br></li><li> Two game modes<br></li><li> Windows &amp; Linux cross-compatibility<br></li><li> Cosmetic items which you can sell on the market!<br></li><li> Steam and Discord integration (Rich Presence)<br></li><li> Really really satisfying kills<br></li><li> No gambling, loot boxes or microtransactions<br></li><li> Over 20 supported languages<br></li><li> Bots!<br></li><li> EXPLOSIONS!<br></li><li> Custom matches!</li></ul>(yes I stayed up late to make those rubber duckies)<br>  <br>  <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/876780/extras/06709218072a5bbd6941ac87375879d1.avif?t=1582280991\" width=616 height=154 /></span>  <br>Our goal is to make an enjoyable game for everyone to play with friends, not to make a fortune. It all started just for fun and we want to keep it fun.  <br>We're a tiny team of four high schoolers. We work on Kronorite in our free time and despite our limited resources, it turned out to be a great little project and we hope everyone enjoys playing it as much as we enjoyed developing it.",
