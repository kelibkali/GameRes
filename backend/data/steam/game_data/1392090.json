    "description": "Historical machines are at their best in their natural habitat: the circuits as they were during their respective eras, and for which they were designed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAutomobilista 2 has the largest selection of historical cars and tracks for them to race on, and the Historical Track Pack Pt1 extends that selection with 3 new tracks: <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCASCAIS 1988<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe modern circuit at Cascais as already featuring in AMS2 remains a unique track which has retained a lot of its historical character, but during the 80s and 90s it was magical - the run out of the Parabolica (with a faster profile then), down the long downhill straight to bring the car to top speed before launching itself into two high speed right-handers, all of which surrounded by very little run-off was a sight to behold.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is the track where Ayrton Senna scored his first pole and won his first race in 1985 with the Lotus 97T in the pouring rain (which incidentally you can reproduce with our Real Weather system), and where his feud with teammate Alain Prost really started to developed during the 1988 race, as he squeezed Prost in his sister MP4/4 into the pit wall in a real hair-raising moment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJEREZ 1988<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimilarly, to Cascais, the modern circuit of Jerez is already present in AMS2 and has preserved a lot of the character of the original layout. Back in 1988 however run-offs were a lot more limited, and the first sector had a sequence of left/right sweepers that looked dazzling from onboard footage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSenna won at Jerez in 1986 with the Lotus 98T after barely holding back the late-charging Nigel Mansell for a photo finish; then again in 1989 to keep his WDC chances that year alive for the Suzuka showdown against Prost that followed. In 1990 he had to confront his fears in the aftermath of Martin Donnelly´s horrific practice crash in his way to a then unrivalled total of 50th pole position in only his 7th season of F1 with a thrilling lap that left most in the circuit in awe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBATHURST 1983<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe third track of this first Historical Track Pack offers something different from the previous two for a different type of racing altogether - the road through the hills of Mount Panorama today as it already features in AMS2 remains a fantastically dangerous challenge, but almost 40 years ago it was a different level of Australian insanity altogether - while the layout itself has remained largely the same over the years, the bumpy roads, high curbs and long segments without any wall or barrier separating the speeding cars from the surrounding hills, trees and light poles meant there was a lot more than glory relying on the driver´s precision.",
