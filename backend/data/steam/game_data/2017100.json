    "description": "This is a 2D action game in which you control &quot;MOONMAN&quot; with a powerful beam attack that cleaves everything in its path and runs to the moon.<br>The beam drains energy, which can be said to be its own life. Recapture the energy by properly identifying and destroying obstacles that hold the moon's energy and those that do not.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story</h2>A space colony located far from the Earth.<br>There, top-secret attempts are being made to study the moon's unknown energy and use it as a new resource.<br>The laboratory's masterpiece, the artificial man &quot;MOONMAN,&quot; is touted to be responsible for the evolution of mankind.<br>Sleeping deep underground, he now begins to dangerously correspond with the moon. ......<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Game Features</h2>Powerful beam attacks are the game's most distinctive feature. It can drown out any object and inflict enormous damage on the enemy.<br>However, the beam attack is accompanied by self-inflicted damage. And MOONMAN has only 4 HP.<br>This means that it can only be used up to three times in a row, again putting its own life in danger.<br>The key is to recover the energy, as MOONMAN is surrounded by various objects and enemies that store the moon's energy.<br>By destroying them, the energy is recovered and the beam attack can be used again.<br>The MOONMAN must properly identify objects that have energy and those that do not, and fire a series of beams while recovering energy. This is the shortest shortcut to the fastest possible clear.",
