    "description": "After being homeschooled for a few years, Luka leaves the confines of his family mansion for the first time to attend an ordinary school. There he immediately gets an offer to join a goofy drama club and help one of its members, by the name of Alice, stage a play based on her script.<br><br>The fame-seeking girl draws ideas from a manuscript called &quot;My Countless Worlds&quot;, which she had stumbled upon during one of her visits to the library. However, something hardly inspiring for an artist is hidden among the magical worlds. The last page contains a grim prophecy – in three years' time, on a hot day in July, Alice will die after falling from the viewing platform at the top of Enchanted Cape.<br><br>This is the first time Luka has seen the said manuscript, but after reading through it he can't help but notice how eerily similar the author's handwriting is to his own.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Game Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A visual novel about school, but without a single class! Well, without even a single classroom background art. I mean, don't students get tired of all the studying? Time to relax!<br></li><li>Pairings, lots of pairings! Juvenile romance, midlife crisis romance, even some not-exactly-human romance...<br></li><li>A tiny oasis for escapists and lazy dreamers. No need to move toward your goal — sit down and dream about it. <br></li><li>Aesthetics of eras bygone. Have you ever thought you were born in the wrong century? This story's characters know your feelings quite well – they do all they can to turn their school into a world they could be content with!<br></li><li>Costume drama! My Countless Worlds: Enchanted Cape is a perfect fit for those who can't resist a huge assortment of different clothes!<br></li><li>Real artistic trials (with some imaginary tribulations).<br></li><li>Fanservice with a twist. Do you enjoy beach episodes where girls in bikinis play around and swim in the sea? Why not find out what it looked like a couple of centuries ago?<br></li><li>Horrible performances on the school stage and a whole lot of poorly chosen literary devices from Alice and her club!</li></ul>",
