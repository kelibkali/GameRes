    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This is the original version of Braid from 2009, which may not work well on newer systems. For an updated version of the game with nicer graphics, more levels and a large amount of developer commentary, see<strong> Braid, Anniversary Edition</strong>.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Braid is a puzzle-platformer, drawn in a painterly style, where you can manipulate the flow of time in strange and unusual ways. From a house in the city, journey to a series of worlds and solve puzzles to rescue an abducted princess. In each world, you have a different power to affect the way time behaves, and it is time's strangeness that creates the puzzles. The time behaviors include: the ability to rewind, objects that are immune to being rewound, time that is tied to space, parallel realities, time dilation, and perhaps more.                     </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >\t\t\t\t\tBraid treats your time and attention as precious; there is no filler in this game. Every puzzle shows you something new and interesting about the game world.                     </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >\t\t\t\t\tKey features:                    </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >\t\t\t\t\t</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Newly added Steam Cloud support</strong>\t<br>Save your in-progress game to the cloud, then play where you left off from on any Steam connected computer.<br>\t\t\t\t\t</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Forgiving yet challenging gameplay: </strong>                    <br>Braid is a 2-D platform game where you can never die and never lose. Despite this, Braid is challenging — but the challenge is about solving puzzles, rather than forcing you to replay tricky jumps.                    <br>\t\t\t\t\t</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Rich puzzle environment: </strong>                    <br>Travel through a series of worlds searching for puzzle pieces, then solving puzzles by manipulating time: rewinding, creating parallel universes, setting up pockets of dilated time. The gameplay feels fresh and new; the puzzles are meant to inspire new ways of thinking.                    <br>\t\t\t\t\t</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Aesthetic design: </strong>                    <br>A painterly art style and lush, organic soundtrack complement the unique gameplay.                    <br>\t\t\t\t\t</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Nonlinear story: </strong>                    <br>A nonlinear fiction links the various worlds and provides real-world metaphors for your time manipulations; in turn, your time manipulations are projections of the real-world themes into playful &quot;what-if&quot; universes where consequences can be explored.                    <br>\t\t\t\t\t</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Nonlinear gameplay: </strong>                    <br>The game doesn't force you to solve puzzles in order to proceed. If you can't figure something out, just play onward and return to that puzzle later.                    </p></li></ul>",
