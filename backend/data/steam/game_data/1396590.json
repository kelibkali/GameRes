    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > Starfinder RPG - Devastation Ark AP 1: Waking the Worldseed</h2>The discovery of a series of millennia-old ruins sets off a chain of events that puts an ancient titanic spacecraft on course to the Pact Worlds. When the vessel--which belongs to an evil, warmongering civilization long thought dead--begins destroying all other ships in its path and attacking important resources to increase its power, the heroes must rescue millions of lives from destruction and find a way to stop the ship and all aboard it. Will the heroes be triumphant? Or will the alien species take the Pact Worlds as its new home and conquer the galaxy?<br>Rescuing a xenoarcheological team on a distant, frozen world from weather gone haywire, the heroes unearth more than they bargained for as an ancient ruin rises from the ground and kicks off a series of events that could change the face of the galaxy forever. The tower contains secrets of a warlike civilization thought long dead and is strangely connected to small moon in the Pact Worlds. Returning to explore a previously unknown facility under the moon's surface that threatens to overheat and destroy all life there, the heroes learn that the moon is signaling a gigantic alien craft, drawing it toward the system with lethal intent!<br>&quot;Waking the Worldseed&quot; is a Starfinder Roleplaying Game adventure for four 13th-level characters.
