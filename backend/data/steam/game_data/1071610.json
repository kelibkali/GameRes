Not if Trumpy and the 'muricans have anything to say about it!  If you're going to succeed you'll have to have to stun enemies with your throwing rocks.  You'll need to find the keys to unlock the doors on the Pence Fences.  You'll have to avoid getting hit by the Tacos from Trump Tower Grill (the best tacos, everyone says).<br><br>BAD HOMBRE takes 1980s arcade platforming and combines it with present-day democratic disaster for the ultimate combination of those two unrelated things!<br><br>Featuring:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Classic arcade style platforming<br></li><li> A plethora of enemies and hazards<br></li><li> Light puzzle elements<br></li><li> Charming 16 color EGA pixel-art<br></li><li> Amazing 8-Bit music</li></ul><br>So go for that High Score and see if you can clear all 30+ levels in BAD HOMBRE.",
