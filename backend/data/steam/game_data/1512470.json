    "description": "<i>The abstract male is the image of God, the absolute something.</i><br><br>Sam isn't exactly looking for a girlfriend. He's content living an aimless life, browsing imageboards and hanging out with his buddies Jake and Jonathan. Recently however, Sam has become entangled in a web of twisted conspiracy theories, causing intrusive thoughts about the opposite sex to occupy his mind. <br><br>Follow Sam during his irreversible descent into the abyss.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About</h2>Incel Syndrome is a freeware video game. It has been available in early access starting Spring 2021. The full version of the game was released Summer 2021.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Themes</h2>Through it's narrative, Incel Syndrome attempts to present a nuanced view of Incel subculture, as opposed to the caricatures that are frequently depicted. The game explores currents within contemporary internet-culture, contrasting them against the theories of Otto Weininger — a young Austrian philosopher who tragically ended his life in 1903, shortly after completing a 500-page treatise on male-female relations.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay</h2>Incel Syndrome is an interactive visual novel. The player is able to freely explore two timelines: the PRESENT, which documents Sam's current interactions and activities; and the PAST, a manifesto-style account of his life until the present day. At the end of the game both timelines converge in an unprecedented display of phantasmagoric apotheosis.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Controls</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Progress: [Space]<br></li><li>Enter/Exit Menu: [Esc]<br></li><li>Select choice: [Mouse]<br></li><li>Full Screen: [Alt] + [Enter]</li></ul><br>Produced by S.O.C.A.H<br>Written by LAN",
