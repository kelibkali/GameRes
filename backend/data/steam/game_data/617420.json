And for a long time he ruled the Kingdom just because the lazy and well prospering animals didn’t care about politics. Years have passed as fast as new budget cuts were appearing. But what struck the animals in the Kingdom was the reform of public media. Bigger license fee?! Oh, we will not tolerate that! But thankfully there was a law, or maybe a so called a hole in law, that let any animal challenge current ruler. The only detail, that the cat Leonidas didn’t notice was the fact that it was in fact an open tournament. So it wasn’t long before more contenders appeared to claim the throne for their own reasons.<br>So it’s time to sharpen your claws and fangs, prepare your hair and nail – the fight is about to Begin!<br><br><strong>Game Modes:</strong><br><br>Collector - you will get a random set of items to collect as fast as you can and bring them to your table. It will not be easy as enemies will definitely try to stop you. But you have all the tools you need to win – use your special ability in the right time or pick up a level specific power-up to gain advantage. <br><br>Runner – the name says it all – run as fast as you can to the finish line! But beware of the traps on the stage! <br><br>Catcher – try to catch most of the cannonballs fired by the cannons! But remember – enemies never sleep. Also watch out for the exploding bombs! <br><br>Destroyer – every animal has their favorite color – this time they will destroy boxes in that color. Animal with best score wins.<br><br><strong>Characters:</strong><br><br>From the start we will have:<br><br>•\tCat Leonidas<br>•\tPig Shaw<br>•\tSloth Jasper<br>•\tLion Bryan<br><br>After beating arcade mode a few times you will unlock:<br><br>•\tPanda Ed<br>•\tRat Clarence<br>•\tAnteater Arnold<br>•\tProboscis Monkey Gary<br>•\tT-Rex Bobby<br>•\tMecha-Dog Zax",
