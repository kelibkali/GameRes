    "description": "Super Game Jam is an engaging new documentary series following some of the world’s most talented indie game developers doing what they do best. Filmed in five cities over a six month time period, each episode pairs two indie developers together for 48 hours and challenges them to create a game based on a theme suggested by their peers. The series examines the creative process, technical skill, and friendships that form through a game jam event on a more personal and intimate level. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/288290/extras/91313f095ec4fc0699b1d94dda19b13d.webp?t=1667260111\" width=616 height=50 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Five short films about creation of five short games released over five months.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Prototype versions of the game developed during each episode's jam.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Special features include behind the scenes footage, music, and promotional trailers.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Musical score by Doseone and Kozilek.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/288290/extras/47e1fa59d12185aa1c949e639a4d3a5b.webp?t=1667260111\" width=616 height=50 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/288290/extras/4bccb5b0007d7dd8484884aa696890b4.avif?t=1667260111\" width=616 height=224 /></span><br><br>Episode 1 | Utrecht, Netherlands<br>Jan Willem Nijman (Ridiculous Fishing, LUFTRAUSERS) + Richard Boeser (Ibb and Obb)<br><br>Episode 2 | Berlin, Germany<br>Dominik Johann (Impetus, LAZA KNITEZ!!) + Christoffer Hedborg (Shelter, Pid)<br><br>Episode 3 | Oakland, USA<br>Adam Drucker (doseone, Samurai Gunn) + Sos Sosowski (McPixel)<br><br>Episode 4 | Gothenburg, Sweden<br>Jonatan Söderström (Hotline Miami) + Martin Jonasson (Rymdkapsel)<br><br>Episode 5 | London, England<br>Tom Francis (Gunpoint) + Liselore Goedhart (Remembering, Nott Won't Sleep)",
