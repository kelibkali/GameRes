Composed by Ben Prunty.<br><br>Originally inspired by John Carpenter and other 80's films, this soundtrack eventually grew to pull inspirations from Danny Elfman, William Orbit, Nine Inch Nails, funk music, and old video games. The whole album ended up being quite a grab bag of different styles and ideas. This is what makes soundtracks fun!<br><br>Despite being part of a comedy game, the music plays its part relatively straight-faced. This helps sell the atmosphere and lets the comedy do its own thing without the player being distracted. I also wanted the music to reflect the rich colors of the game's gorgeous pixel art.<br><br>The album cover art was made by Paul Conway, the artist for The Darkside Detective.",
