No stone is upside down anymore. Steam Edition and Professional Edition are now state of the art. For the CUR3D Steam Edition there will be updates in the same rhythm as for the CUR3D Maker Edition (without Steam) and CUR3D Professional.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >When is the CUR3D Steam Edition the right choice?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>If you have faulty 3D data that should be 3D printed<br></li><li>If you want to quickly convert 1: 1 large 3D CAD data into 3D printable models<br></li><li>If you do illustrative model making<br></li><li>If you want to 3D print architectural models<br></li><li>If Autodesk netfabb, Materialize Magics and other tools are too complicated and time consuming or cannot repair a 3D model<br></li><li>If you don't want to spend money on 3D data repairs at 3D printing service providers<br></li><li>... and and and ...</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/668660/extras/a5d9570b8d5ffbf329ad16a59cc8aa70.avif?t=1722356016\" width=616 height=210 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >3D printing as easy as printing on a white piece of paper</h2>CUR3D, the first real 3D printing prepress, will revolutionize your workflow with 3D printers. No matter what type of vision models you want to print, CUR3D will revolutionize, accelerate and simplify your work with 3D printers. Now you can concentrate on the essentials and CUR3D does the rest. Thus a high level of productivity, quality gain, cost and time savings is achieved. <strong>„Now it’s printable, because it’s CUR3D!“</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/668660/extras/d5f0bcbb4962ff5445573fe2094fa3a0.avif?t=1722356016\" width=616 height=422 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The first real 3D printing prepress</h2>Most CAD data are not printable out of the box. Usually several hours of preparation of the drawings are necessary: thin walls and overlapping surfaces must be corrected, as well as wrong normals. The filling of cavities and holes takes much time, too. And if the scaling factor also deviates from the original data, frustration is pre-programmed. RUHRSOURCE CUR3D (spoken: cured) reduces the amount of work from many hours to a few minutes. The Gutenberg-revolution for additive manufacturing: No matter what type of vision models you want to print, CUR3D will revolutionize your work with 3D printers and, above all, speed up the process. Now you can concentrate on the essentials and CUR3D does the rest.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Some before-and-after examples</h2>Generative StructureSynth design:<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/668660/extras/db499b85f86f170a39b38422c2e89a90.avif?t=1722356016\" width=616 height=422 /></span><br><br>Technical 3D model of an extruder:<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/668660/extras/eddcc2589234bd74111cdd5bae55e4c2.avif?t=1722356016\" width=616 height=422 /></span><br><br>Model of a brick car with interior:<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/668660/extras/e5731b7b67e6723377f4eef990ab3b44.avif?t=1722356016\" width=616 height=422 /></span><br><br>Medical scan of a urinary tract:<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/668660/extras/a33559426c968f8df0c0b4d3b02ccd6e.avif?t=1722356016\" width=616 height=422 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Data Input – Magic Box – Data Output</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>CUR3D scales 3D models without loss, thickens surfaces to a printable minimum, corrects overlapping surfaces as well as improper normals and closes gaps.<br></li><li>CUR3D operates completely automatic, fast and absolutely secure.
