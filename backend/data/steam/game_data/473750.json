Lead your noble house, command vassals, expand your lands and wage wars — but true success isn’t just about power. Build alliances, broker peace, and outmaneuver rivals in a grand strategy where ambition and opportunity often clash with virtue and empathy. And remember: every opponent is a real player, weighing your every move.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/473750/extras/5cf66b50bb267068fc8a13b42ca7dd26.webp?t=1771421178\" width=800 height=18 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Feudums aims to be a heartfelt tribute and an ambitious blend of turn-based 4X, grand strategy, and persistent online play — without some long-standing frustrations of the genres.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >NO PAY-TO-WIN GIMMICKS, NO GRIND.

Give instructions to your armies, fiefdoms and serfs to handle affairs in your absence. Let your court prepare administrative reserves, ensuring your realm is ready for your commands when you return.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >...

WITH BLOOD AND SWEAT</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >War is costly, bitter, and leaves lasting scars on your realm. A detailed battle system offers deep tactical choices, with multi-tick battles and long sieges that allow reinforcements to tip the scales. Seasonal military campaigns with levy troops — lances — form the backbone of warfare. Plan your wars on the game map and share your strategies with allies, as alliances and betrayals shape the fate of kingdoms.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >... WITH WITS OR SCHEMES</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Feudums thrives on a fluid, community-driven narrative system where a single decision can shift the course of history, and you're never the only one trying to shape events. No agreement is set in stone, but breaking them without a solid reason — or a convincingly fabricated one — can backfire, handing rivals control over the unfolding events.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/473750/extras/930f187eafd8a7251c5f519573079602.webp?t=1771421178\" width=616 height=62 /></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/473750/extras/c9ef247f0bc33808a85eb79ff4c5c0b2.poster.avif?t=1771421178\" width=616 height=240 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/473750/extras/c9ef247f0bc33808a85eb79ff4c5c0b2.webm?t=1771421178\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/473750/extras/c9ef247f0bc33808a85eb79ff4c5c0b2.mp4?t=1771421178\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >... YOUR FEUDAL SOCIETY</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Forge your own feudal network by enrolling others — friends or strangers — as vassals, or swear a carefully worded oath to a liege. As feudal society shifts, new opportunities and dilemmas emerge, but seizing them comes with consequences for all parties involved.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >... A STABLE DOMAIN</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Ride the seasonal system as it shapes the harsh realities of medieval life — where growth, health, labor, or warfare all shift with the changing seasons. Manage your fiefdoms by building castles in strategic locations, expanding cities, and crafting thriving, specialized, or self-sustaining regions to adapt to the ever-changing circumstances. Oversee your population's needs,  guide their life and labor, but remember: winter is always just around the corner!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >... YOUR LEGACY AND LORE</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Grow your noble house like a sturdy oak, its branches stretching wide with your achievements and nourished by the drops of your blood. Forge your coat of arms from a vast library of historic heraldry, unlocking house traits, heraldic devices, and titles over multiple sessions. Watch your legacy unfold on the very shields you wield, with each device representing different merits, deeds, or stains in your troubled history.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/473750/extras/af88a364a97f8f8783dd9d3a26a7b3b5.webp?t=1771421178\" width=616 height=62 /></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >... THE COURSE OF YOUR STORY</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Every political decision sparks new dilemmas, opening the door to new diplomatic, economic, and military moves. The dynamic, community-driven social landscape keeps each playthrough fresh, giving you a chance to bend the flow of history to your will. But remember, politics is never a solitary game, and in its tangled web, everyone is a potential target.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >... YOUR STYLE</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Exert full agency over how you present yourself — and your house — to others. Customize your heraldry, tailor the look of your court and hall, craft your banners, and modify the appearance of your armies, castles, or settlements. While purely aesthetic, these choices let you broadcast your message and personality.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >... THE GAME</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Designed from the ground up with modding in mind, Feudums offers a wide arrays of customization options, from simple tweaks like toggling features on/off or creating custom rulebooks, to complete game overhauls, such as altering game mechanics or AI behavior. No two playthroughs need to be the same —  shape the game to your vision, and share that vision to others!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/473750/extras/7dbebc361c656dbf41f03a3d02e40f0c.avif?t=1771421178\" width=616 height=220 /></span></p>",
