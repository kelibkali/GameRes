We're on the Discord server all the time, and we play the game too. We try to not be greedy and give you most everything you can have, for free. You'll see dozens of hours of gameplay before you'd even benefit from spending; and at that point, a $10 purchase is all it takes to be completely set. And even that isn't necessary to progress or be competitive. We're not out to get rich; we just want to keep doing this: our dream job. It's free, so why not give it a try to see if you like it?",
