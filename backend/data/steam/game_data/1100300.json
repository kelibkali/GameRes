With the loudest voice winning arguments and deciding what decision gets implemented?<br><br>Play as a member of a team, making some hard and some not so hard decisions. If you win, your choices get implemented. Lose, and your game and studio might head in a direction you did not sign up for.<br><br>Work your way up from arcade-style games to full-fledged AAA releases. Once you start your journey as an Indie developer, move to new studio locations and hire the right people as you work your way up in the industry. There's a lot to handle, but you've got this. It was your dream, after all.<br><br>Did we tell you how Game Development wasn't easy?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1100300/extras/8ec0b617c2853243875800219937a243.avif?t=1653236700\" width=600 height=124 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Decision Making</strong> - Back decisions of different departments on day to day issues.<br></li><li><strong>Management</strong> - Manage Employee Happiness and tactical Crunch times for maximized productivity.<br></li><li><strong>Procedural</strong> rogue-lite progression.<br></li><li><strong>Deep Combat</strong> (Allegedly) - Persistent stress tolerance (health) between projects.
