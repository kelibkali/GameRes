You keep progressing through obscure rooms, halls and areas passing the servants of darkness; Trying to solve the mysteries that are lying ahead of you. Will this nightmare ever end? <br><br><strong>Features</strong><br>Focusing on the roots of classic horror games &quot;Clockwise&quot; uses the elements of darkness, sounds and visual trickery. The game can be played over and over again and never be exactly the same like it used to be before.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Dark atmosphere<br></li><li>Changing playthroughs<br></li><li>Classic riddles <br></li><li>A lot of dynamic interaction<br></li><li>Best performance and look thanks to the Unreal Development Kit (UE3)<br></li><li>English, German, Russian and Korean available</li></ul><br><strong>Some Background</strong><br>I started this just because i wanted to create a small horror game for people to enjoy. It is hard nowadays to find good horror games that really live up to the expectations. Most just get stuck in development... stay a concept or a demo of some sort. That's why I decided a long time ago to make the world &quot;a better place&quot; and provide it with actually good horror games - Games that dont throw a jumpscare on you... play an overly loud sound... simply appear cheap and not well done. <br><br>Some people may know the &quot;Wooden Floor&quot; - games by me. I wanted this game to be similar from the look - but different from the gameplay and feel - more simple and direct. The idea was to create something like the SCP-Games, that every horror fan should be familiar with... but it all became much bigger and better than intended. Me myself would call this my best work so far.",
