    "description": "The ETR 1000 “Frecciarossa” is a train, that lives superlatives: being one of the world's fastest trains, it reached a lunatic 400 km/h.<br>Being in service throughout Italy, the futuristic looking ETR consists of 8 coaches and connects the Italian metropolises with speeds up to 360 km/h.<br>The extravagant exterior design continues in the interior. No less than four different classes are available for passengers to choose from, fitting all needs and all moneybags: starting with a normal “standard” class seating, up to a truly luxurious “executive” class (only carrying 10 passengers at a time).<br>Our Pro Trainz®-range, synonym for highest quality, is perfectly extended by our new Frecciarossa.<br><br>Beside the sheer amount of details and functions, this train is fully fitted to move freely through the whole interior. This means, you are free to explore the complete train.<br><br>Bistro, standard coaches, premium and business coaches and of course the executive coach: all of them include every (and we mean: every!) single detail, set in scene with passion.<br><br>Built with the newest physical based rendering technology, this train is really showing the future!<br>Assisted by countless features like cruise control, train safety systems, manual door controls and much more, there is really nothing more to wish.<br>How does it sound to travel through the landscapes with 300 km/h? Find out for yourself! All sounds were custom built for this model.<br><br>Two sessions for the Sebino-Route are already included.
