Combined with inherent talents and flaws, each ranger will play differently. Perhaps you will pick a Legolas-like archer of death who can plow through levels through sheer arrow power? Or select one who relies more on stealth and magic? Or another who relies on the aid of forest animals?<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1477470/extras/36cc70acdc7acc86b36230e3e1edd3bb.avif?t=1672555614\" width=696 height=224 /></span><br><br>SURVIVAL MANAGEMENT<br>Rescue villagers, find artifacts, or just invest money in the town.

Each ranger will encounter different people and situations during his quest. Depending on your choices, his subsequent path will be altered, taking him to new locations, dangers, and treasures.
