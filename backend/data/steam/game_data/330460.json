Everything in state of constant orbital motion. Perform orbital maneuvers and keep your space ships on stable orbits to prevent crashing on a planet or loosing ship in deep space.<br>The physics simulates in 2D space, this makes flying and navigation enjoyable and easy but also generates a lot of interesting situations due physical collisions which are more often in 2D space than in 3D.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/330460/extras/1ad801e11c3ed0992f43bd82919d7336.poster.avif?t=1699181351\" width=616 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/330460/extras/1ad801e11c3ed0992f43bd82919d7336.webm?t=1699181351\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/330460/extras/1ad801e11c3ed0992f43bd82919d7336.mp4?t=1699181351\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Galaxy</h2><br>Explore a procedural galaxy filled with various types of stars, black holes, planets, asteroids, space stations and other interesting things which we will constantly add in the future.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/330460/extras/3a4d9d62f672dbf2d0deff2a340129d6.poster.avif?t=1699181351\" width=616 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/330460/extras/3a4d9d62f672dbf2d0deff2a340129d6.webm?t=1699181351\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/330460/extras/3a4d9d62f672dbf2d0deff2a340129d6.mp4?t=1699181351\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Fully Customizable Ships and Space stations</h2><br>You can build your own ship part by part.
