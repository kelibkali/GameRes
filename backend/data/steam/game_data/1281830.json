Explore among the massive trees, plants and terrain to see what the jungle holds inside.<br><br>All details are subject to change as this game will evolve over time based on feedback from the community. This is a description of what we hope the game will become. If you want to know exactly the state that the game is in currently, please visit our Dev Logs, join our Discord and view our Roadmap to see progress.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Climb into the expansive Canopy</h2>You are sent to conduct scientific research, but soon learn more is going on. The planet is completely covered in a layer of vegetation so thick that we have no way of detecting what lies beneath the Canopy. Build, craft and harvest resources to survive in this hostile environment.<br>You are on your own.<br>The Canopy awaits.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Harvest, Craft, and Survive</h2>After landing in your Drop Pod, look around for food, water, minerals to start building the equipment you need to survive and explore. Collect resources from plants, animals and more to find what you need. Craft a better suit, tools, lights, buildings, and vehicles. Explore both below and above to find more advanced and rare materials, flora and fauna.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Build Habitats Designed for the Canopy</h2>Build bases on the jungle floor or high up into the trees. Construct bridges between your buildings so you don't have to venture to the dangerous jungle floor. Choose different layouts to maximize efficiency or simply design your dream base. Your can have buildings that store resources, hold your vehicles, and replenish your oxygen, so you're ready for another trek into the jungle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Discover the Mystery</h2>Why were you sent here? What do we want with this planet? These questions and more will be answered in the story once it's implemented<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Fear the Night</h2>As the light fades in the Canopy, fauna and flora alike tend to change. The more dangerous predators come out. The flora become more beautiful, but also more aggressive. This place can be quite unforgiving if you dare to venture out into the darkness.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Open Development</h2>Get updates wherever you want. We post updates in Hatchet, events right here on Steam, our DevLogs on YouTube, Twitter and in our newsletter, which you can find on our website. You can also come chat with us on Discord!<br>We believe in having development open so you know what to expect, so we created a Roadmap, accessible on our website.<br> We want to build the best game possible and we hope you'll join us along for the ride.",
