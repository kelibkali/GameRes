    "description": "Beyond The Wire is a large-scale multiplayer first-person shooter immersing players in the frantic and bloody Western Front of the Great War.  Utilizing both period-appropriate guns and a more tactical close-quarters melee combat system, the action in Beyond The Wire is more comprehensive than anything seen in a WW1 game to date.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1058650/extras/48429412f8bebce3b0666eb03a4eee29.poster.avif?t=1707462227\" width=600 height=170 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1058650/extras/48429412f8bebce3b0666eb03a4eee29.webm?t=1707462227\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1058650/extras/48429412f8bebce3b0666eb03a4eee29.mp4?t=1707462227\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Massive Multiplayer Action </h2>In battles with up to 100 real-world combatants, players are split into two 50 person teams with each team broken into nine person squads and a commander overseeing the battle.
