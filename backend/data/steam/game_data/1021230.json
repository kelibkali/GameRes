    "description": "Made on a budget of 0 dollars, Ball Bounce Maze is an independent game made by an amateur developer. <br>Simply put, it is a randomized physics-based puzzle game. <br>The objective is to use bouncers to make the ball hit the target while avoiding the obstacles, walls, ceiling, or floor. Easy? No! <br>Having different ways to score makes this game as long or short as you want it. Shortest time. Longest time. Most bounces. There are a billion playing fields, but you can spend all night on just one trying to get a better score in just one category.<br>Post a video of your result and compare it to others’ results. Show your work, or no one will believe you.<br>Place and rotate the bouncers: <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1021230/extras/a360274ce7c16b31bba0bdc8da1b3057.webp?t=1753186767\" width=88 height=22 /></span><br>To bounce the ball:<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1021230/extras/a81d2479d46c4c4f2c492b2f412359ad.webp?t=1753186767\" width=51 height=51 /></span><br>To avoid the obstacles:<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1021230/extras/6e5e7335e0ae26158e999efb91bf7718.webp?t=1753186767\" width=25 height=25 /></span><br>To eventually hit the target at the bottom after bouncing around a lot.<br>Young kids just like to watch the ball bounce around.
