    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>A quick word from the developer:</strong></h2>Super Mega Space Blaster Special was created by one person, half of Bare Knuckle Development, Ste Wilson. As the game is made by a solo developer don't expect triple A standards, mind-blowing graphics or a massive in depth story. What you can expect is a fun, challenging retro space shooter with solid core-gameplay, couch co-op and leaderboards for less than the price of cup of coffee. <br><br><br>If you have any questions, problems, or feedback about the game just give us a shout. We’d love to hear what you think of the game and will do our best to respond as quickly as possible, providing support if necessary. Also let us know if you had fun playing the game because that really does make our day!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1080330/extras/53373b4090cc69d08366840a09645fcf.avif?t=1584707083\" width=616 height=120 /></span><br>A modern take on the retro arcade shoot 'em up (shmup). Super Mega Space Blaster Special is an addictive, fast-paced space shooter with bullet hell elements. Blast your way through 3 modes; managing fuel and ammo to get to the big-boss in 'Survival Mode', protecting your mothership from damage in 'Protect Mother Mode', and blasting your friends into space dust in the local competitive multiplayer 'To The Death Mode'. <br><br>Play with a friend in local coop and work together to take out the aliens. Collect coins to unlock more space blasters and get higher scores. Use each space blaster's strengths to your advantage from turrets that allow twin stick control, to fast manoeuvrable ships that can outrun your foes. Arm yourself to the teeth with awesome power-ups like big-bombs, homing missiles and lasers. Destroy the alien boss and continue the endless gameplay to rack up a massive score and become the ultimate space blaster pilot and top the leaderboards.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1080330/extras/317a59d55a4bdc64fd6f1602d2e2a3fd.avif?t=1584707083\" width=616 height=67 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Fast-paced addictive shmup gameplay with bullet hell elements.<br></li><li> 3 play modes give varied gameplay and replay-ability.

Whilst working on a bigger game (The Flawless: Art's Tale) for console and PC we took a month long break to make this game. When designing Super Mega Space Blaster Special we wanted to make a game that had that fun retro feeling of playing couch coop and competitive games with your mates or trying to get your name in an arcade game's leaderboard.<br><br>We also wanted to make sure the game offered great value for money and was fun to play, giving that urge for <i>'just one more go'</i>. Now you can be the judge of this, leave a Steam review and let us know what you think. We are open to feedback and want to improve the game in any way we can. If you have any issues with the game please feel free to let us know and we'll do our best to solve the problem. We hope you enjoy the game, Happy blasting!",
