Every Saturday, she goes to a nearby antique store to buy ancient stuff in order to add them to her collections in her museum. On 20th September, she went to the shop to buy an ancient cursed doll. She was a skeptic and did not believe in ghosts until she experienced the paranormal activities herself. As soon as she brought the doll to her museum the things started to take a darker turn. Her museum was on the ground floor while she lived on the fourth floor and the rest three floors were empty. But she started experiencing paranormal activities including things getting misplaced, poltergeist activities and nightmare. A few days following the incident she started researching the history behind the doll and discovered that the doll was cursed. She was desperately in search of the remedy of the situation but she came to know that the only way to stop the paranormal activities was to get rid of the doll and sending it over to its previous location where the doll was originally kept and the curse would be lifted.<br><br>However, it is easier said than done. The Devil residing inside the doll will try to stop Mary from achieving her goal. Will she be able to lift the curse, placed on her? Her fate is in your hands now. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1181470/extras/464131256e9d654d3d8b58ed1eaa1e16.poster.avif?t=1762696383\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1181470/extras/464131256e9d654d3d8b58ed1eaa1e16.webm?t=1762696383\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1181470/extras/464131256e9d654d3d8b58ed1eaa1e16.mp4?t=1762696383\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features:</h2></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Explore the Museum for the proof of the paranormal.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Demons are lurking in the shadows.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Experience the poltergeist activities and nightmarish illusions.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Face your fears while exploring the building and unknown locations.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Nearly half an hour duration of the paranormal investigation.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1181470/extras/1b4bd7b7c659f7c71d5d0888ddff3086.poster.avif?t=1762696383\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1181470/extras/1b4bd7b7c659f7c71d5d0888ddff3086.webm?t=1762696383\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1181470/extras/1b4bd7b7c659f7c71d5d0888ddff3086.mp4?t=1762696383\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Note: I am a solo indie game developer and I have done all of the graphics, animation, character design, and programming except for the music.
