But nerves of steel are highly required to <strong>compete for the worldwide leading position!</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >THE SUPRALYMPIC WORLD</h2><br>Several hundred years after the <i>technological revolution</i>, the Supralympic Games became the world's foremost sports competition. They reflect the values and human aspirations of a sunless future.<br><br>You were born during the reign of manufactured products, long after the replacement of nature wherever it could be replaced. You even left your flesh body for the promise of technological eternity.<br><br>But while you could experience an infinity of forms, you embraced the life of a supralympian athlete. You have been training over and over to master and improve this high-tech body. In the hope that one day <strong>the Supralympic champion’s title</strong> will be yours…<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/840300/extras/a3b1c6b2b4b694967f45b77a3f3f2e2b.poster.avif?t=1668086822\" width=616 height=258 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/840300/extras/a3b1c6b2b4b694967f45b77a3f3f2e2b.webm?t=1668086822\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/840300/extras/a3b1c6b2b4b694967f45b77a3f3f2e2b.mp4?t=1668086822\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >MAIN FEATURES</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Rocket-powered running: run over 60 mph thanks to your back thruster.<br></li><li>Dash: break through obstacles thanks to your <i>rocket-shield</i>.<br></li><li>Bullet-time: experience the world in slow-motion thanks to your <i>chronostaser</i>.<br></li><li>Brakes: slow down, and recycle kinetic energy to get back some dash power!<br></li><li>A progression system: <strong>XP</strong> and <strong>Uracoins</strong> earned based on your running results.<br></li><li><strong>Workshop</strong>: spend Uracoins to customise your runner with armor pieces, back-thrusters and other advanced technologies.<br></li><li><strong>Athlete edition</strong>: choose the planet and nation you run for, and honor them by defeating others!<br></li><li>3 competition scales: national, international and interplanetary.<br></li><li>3 difficulty levels: rookie, pro, elite.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >STUNGATE MECHANISM</h2><br>Run as far as you can, avoid obstacles and hurry up while the <strong>Stungate</strong> is still open !<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/840300/extras/732fcbb7692437485d649f96744e9ab8.avif?t=1668086822\" width=616 height=238 /></span><br><br>What the hell is a <strong>Stungate</strong>?

This speed is driven with physic-based parameters : <i>thrust</i> of motor and legs and body <i>drag</i>.<br>Indeed it’s <strong>not an <i>automatic-forward</i> but a <i>minimal-forward</i> mechanic</strong> forcing you to run.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Lateral Control</li></ul>The runway has <strong>no railroads</strong>. It means that you can <strong>freely and continuously move laterally</strong> between bounding walls.<br>Also, the runner lateral speed is non-linearly affected by its forward speed, it means the fastest you run forward, the slowest you run laterally, following a specific curve.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Vertical Control</li></ul>Well you can obviously <strong>jump</strong> and <strong>slide</strong>, but we took care to improve the vertical mobility of the runner : vertical speed is not only driven by <i>gravity</i> but also by motor <i>thrust</i>. This means you have the ability not only to sustain jumps but also to dive lightning-fast into the ground.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Special Actions</li></ul>You can <strong>dash forward</strong> making your runner invulnerable to minor damages during the thrust.<br>You can also experience the world in <strong>slow motion</strong>, thanks to the <i>chronostaser</i> that comes within your running avatar.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Collisions</li></ul>Because of the fine control considerations above, <strong>the collisions are <i>physic-based</i></strong>. The game accurately detect them based on each body part colliders of your runner.",
