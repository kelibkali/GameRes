    "description": "Ever dreamed of cloning yourself and having your clone do all the work for you? But what if you are that clone, and you can travel through time?<br><br>Welcome to a distant and bureaucratic future where even time is subject to government regulations. In this glorious era of progress, an elderly citizen requires vital medication. He acquires a government-approved Time-Clone™ device for pill delivery. The process is, as always, efficient and precise — to get the pills, he must clone himself and send the clone into the machine, where it solves puzzles, retrieves the pills, and travels through time.<br><br>You play as the clone, created to serve the greater good. Your job is to die so that your future self can literally step over your body and pass an obstacle to retrieve the pills. Do not concern yourself with the clone’s demise— clones are expendable by design.<br><br>If something goes wrong, you can always go back in time and make the same mistakes with your past self all over again.<br><br>In this game, dying is just another step toward success and the timely delivery of the pills!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2092900/extras/567ebff1494b8daee4a5a1e255add54c.poster.avif?t=1726238337\" width=544 height=424 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2092900/extras/567ebff1494b8daee4a5a1e255add54c.webm?t=1726238337\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2092900/extras/567ebff1494b8daee4a5a1e255add54c.mp4?t=1726238337\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Features:</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Time-traveling mechanics: play with your past selves. <br></li><li> Collect ancient artifacts from the Old Era.<br></li><li> Hemoglobin, pixel violence, and dark humor.<br></li><li> Free DLC included!</li></ul>",
