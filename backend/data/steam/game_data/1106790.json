    "description": "<strong>Red Horizon</strong> is an addictive, wave based, space shoot 'em up game. Heavily influenced by the classics of the past, <strong>Red Horizon</strong> takes a modern spin on the genre combining it with some subtle Rogue-like elements to provide players with a unique experience every time they play.<br><br>Hop on board the Red Horizon and shoot your way through numerous waves of different enemies, eventually facing the final boss. Build up strength along your journey by finding items which will not only give you a power up but change the way you play. Just remember to choose wisely!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Note from the Developer</h2><br>I made the Red Horizon whilst travelling to/from work on the train for a number of months. As of right now, the game is small in length but feature complete. With your support, I would love to evolve the game by adding:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>More items<br></li><li>More bosses<br></li><li>More enemies<br></li><li>More ships</li></ul><br>I would also really appreciate any feedback you have in the Steam reviews, or by sending an email to the support contact.<br><br>Thanks for reading!<br>George<br><br>",
