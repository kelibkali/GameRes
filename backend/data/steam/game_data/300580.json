    "description": "Brand New features!! The Void DLC offers endless gameplay, Online Leaderboards, and a Daily Challenge that allows players to compete worldwide for the top score.<br><br>Prepare for the bar to be raised on deep-space 2D dog-fighting! GALAK-Z is a modern, A.I. and physics-driven open-world action game, viewed through the lens of the classic 16-bit space shooter. Powered by the next-generation Cyntient AI platform, GALAK-Z puts players in control of anime-inspired spacecraft inhabiting procedurally generated worlds. <br><br>In GALAK-Z both stealth and skill are required to defeat truly intelligent enemies. You will be forced to outsmart enemies that think, react and cooperate like seasoned pilots! Master your ship’s sublimely-honed controls as you blast enemies, unleash missile salvos, and even toss your opponents, mech-style, to their explosive demise. <br><br>Recently added, Arcade Mode lets you replay failed missions any number of times without losing all of your saved progress. Rogue Mode retains GALAK-Z’s original white-knuckle roguelike challenge that harkens back to the 16-bit era of gaming. Rogue mode will always be available if and when you’re looking to test your skill and bravery by putting everything on the line, every mission. <br><br>Players will be forced to outmaneuver, outgun and outsmart enemies that think, react and cooperate like seasoned pilots. Both stealth and skill are required to defeat enemy squads in a brutal game of cat and mouse. Prepare for an enemy that comes alive like never before! <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Exclusive Guest Star: Juan from Guacamelee featured as an enemy unit in the game!<br></li><li>New The Void DLC w/ endless gameplay and Online Leaderboards and a Daily Challenge<br></li><li>ARCADE mode with per-Mission checkpoints<br></li><li>Procedurally-assembled levels <br></li><li>Physics based combat simulator!<br></li><li>Advanced enemy A.I for intense dogfights!<br></li><li>Scripted missions and ‘roguelite’ structure<br></li><li>Resource-based, progressive weapons system<br></li><li>Inspired by 70s / 80s anime and arcade shooters</li></ul>",
