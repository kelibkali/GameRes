    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>About</strong></h2>This is not yet another derivative fantasy story. In Disturbing Forest, you won’t find princesses to save from dragons or skirmishes of the “hack, slash, and run” variety. While telling a mature detective story, the game will take you on a trip through a wide array of emotions, reflections, and cultural references. All of this is powered by carefully designed gameplay, efficiently balancing between survival elements and logical puzzles.<br><br>You are a former military man, unjustly thrown into the dungeons. When you feel that you’ve found yourself at a dead-end, you get an unexpected visit from an old friend who offers you a deal: freedom in exchange for a favor for his principal. Sounds good, eh? The problem is that the “favor” in this case involves someone losing their head. With your help.<br><br>Disturbing Forest is a first-person puzzle adventure game where you fight, craft, and solve puzzles in detective mode. The action is set in an original fantasy universe, covered with a layer of fairy-tale paints, superimposed on expressive, three-dimensional structures.<br><br>Thanks to a long list of quests – diverse, non-linear tasks that push the plot forward, filled with easter eggs – you can count on tens of hours of unforgettable entertainment. You will often have to prove yourself by fighting monsters, including the most hideous beasts – the ones in human skin. Strength, reflexes, and equipment will be the key factors determining the result of such battles. Other missions will require you to be creative and trust your intellect.<br>Are you looking for a fantasy adventure game focusing on story and immersion, without neglecting gameplay mechanics? We invite you to embark on an unforgettable journey through the vast expanses of the Disturbing Forest!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Features</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Colorful, atmospheric low-poly graphics,<br></li><li>An extensive alchemy system,<br></li><li>Non-linear plot,<br></li><li>An interesting world for exploration,<br></li><li>A lot of easter eggs,<br></li><li>Detective mode to help you discover your story,<br></li><li>Characteristic characters,<br></li><li>Climatic soundtrack.</li></ul>",
