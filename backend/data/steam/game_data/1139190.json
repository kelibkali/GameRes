LETHE shows the disease from a new perspective: the game, seen as an adventure, makes the player fight its symptoms. However, the symptoms advance through the story making the game harder to understand as the player progresses.<br><br>Lethe digs into the mind of a patient focusing on their feelings and transforms those symptoms into game mechanics:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The fear of being lost and not understanding surroundings<br></li><li> Confusing environments and misplaced objects<br></li><li> Loving ones losing patience with the victim<br></li><li> Exploration becomes scary and leading to panic attacks</li></ul><br>The game that we are developing has a clear message: the victims have a monster in their minds, but they are still able to love and be loved. The leitmotiv of the game is expressed by this conversation:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The close ones: Do you know who I am?<br></li><li> The victim: I don't, but I know I love you very much</li></ul>",
