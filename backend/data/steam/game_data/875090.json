    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >D&amp;D Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage</h2>Delve deeper than<br>you ever thought possible in this adventure for the world's<br>greatest roleplaying game.<strong><br><i>Hundreds of years<br>ago, long before Waterdeep had been built, Halaster Blackcloak carved<br>a vast dungeon beneath Mount Waterdeep and stocked it with all manner<br>of creatures from across the planes. Over time Halaster has gone<br>quite insane and the dungeon he carved, now dubbed Undermountain, is<br>a labyrinthine death trap for those bold enough to venture within.<br>Precious few have returned from Halaster's home, and frequently<br>they're not who they were when they started out. One thing is<br>certain however. Wealth unimaginable exists within the halls of<br>Undermountain.</i><br>A grand adventure<br>set in the dungeon beneath the city of Waterdeep with plenty of room<br>for a Dungeon Master to expand and to add depth to a dungeon that has<br>an unlimited number of stories to tell.<br>The leader in<br>providing contemporary fantasy entertainment, Dungeons &amp; Dragons<br>is the wellspring for the entire modern game industry, digital as<br>well as tabletop. Fifth edition D&amp;D draws from every prior<br>edition to create a universally compelling play experience, and<br>exemplifies the true spirit of a game that holds captive the hearts<br>and minds of millions of players worldwide.<br><i>This product includes:</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>High quality artwork<br></li><li>Fantasy Grounds automation<br></li><li>Searchable reference manual<br></li><li>23 Amazing Levels to explore, complete with descriptions, random encounters and more<br></li><li>Skullport<br></li><li>Dozens of Player Quests<br></li><li>All the NPCs, items and magic items you need to play<br></li><li>Monster and NPC tokens<br></li><li>6 Fantasy Grounds Exclusive Story Templates<br></li><li>Fantasy Grounds Exclusive Crib Sheet<br></li><li>Custom colored and textured battlemaps for each level and skullport</li></ul><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i>Zacchaeus</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included D&amp;D fifth edition ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
