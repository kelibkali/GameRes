    "description": "The Smokestack Coffee Company is polluting the town with bad coffee and it`s up to you to open up your own coffee shop and take back the town! Swap coffee beans, milk, sugar and other tasty ingredients to prepare a menu full of tasty blends. Upgrade your shop, recipes, treats and bonuses. Need a jolt? Blast-off with Coffee Rush!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOh no! The overly-aggressive Smokestack Coffee Company is stamping out local competition with its overpriced coffee that tastes like mud. Um, that’s the Smokestack company – though you might have thought they go by another name. Ahem. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt’s up to you to open your own coffee shop and take back all the areas of town dominated by the evil corporation’s trendy cafes. Up for the challenge? While it lacks in the originality department, Coffee Rush can be as addictive as the drink itself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nImagine a puzzle game board like Bejeweled, but instead of an 8×8 grid of gemstones, such as diamonds and rubies, in Coffee Rush you’re playing with coffee beans, milk, sugar, whipped cream, ice cubes and other coffee-related items. The idea is to build a recipe as indicated on the right-hand side of the screen, which involves swapping adjacent items so that you create a line of 3 or more identical items, vertically or horizontally. This causes the items to disappear and make room for additional items to fall down onto the board.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA “Hey Hey Cafe Latte” recipe, for example, might require 7 coffee beans, six milks, five sugars and four lightning bolts. Once you meet this minimum, the drink is ready and you can click on it to give to the waiting customer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimilar to “time management” games, you must make a certain amount of money by the end of the day to move onto the next level or else you need to repeat the day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Gamezebo",
