Crab-like scurillians, massive grael, lonely doreen, mysterious kraken, cruel kehana, and the near-human masaquani now sail the seas aside the new visitors, humans from the age of piracy, dashing corsairs, bloodthirsty bucaneers, and savage sea dogs drawn from the mists of earth on unfamiliar tides. Many believe these visitors to be destined to defeat the Sea Hags and save Caribdus from a watery grave, but most seem interested only in joining the plunder of forgotten treasures in a drowning world.<br>This new Explorer's Size edition of the classic and much-loved 50 Fathoms includes the updated text of the original game, plus the 50 Fathoms Companion, all compatible with Savage Worlds Deluxe and beautifully colored by three-time Hugo Award winning artist Cheyenne Wright!<br>The 50 Fathom's Explorer's Edition is not a complete game.
