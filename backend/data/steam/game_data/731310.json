The captain is going to think they are the most important person, but really they are just pointing where to go and wearing the fanciest hat. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/731310/extras/cee0ba9ec13023ba0f6b8df0e5b44167.avif?t=1600090834\" width=66 height=66 /></span><br><strong>Shields</strong> – Using shields will be critical, they block incoming attacks but break under heavy damage. There are various shield types, which can take more damage, cover a larger area, or recover faster, so choose wisely to survive for as long as possible.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/731310/extras/26bc04633934d4510cd15e37fa6a7d9b.avif?t=1600090834\" width=66 height=66 /></span><br><strong>Holographic Medic</strong> – Space is dangerous, especially for a ragtag crew of loose-cannons who don’t play by the rules and injuries will happen, In the past we used to train humans to be doctors but this takes too long so why not get a computer to do it for you. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/731310/extras/b853edeada1ed11b046ce89fe769a329.avif?t=1600090834\" width=66 height=66 /></span><br><strong>Missiles</strong> – You know what's better than one missile? Lots of missiles! These weapons track down enemies and do damage in an area. However they take a long time to reload, which does give the bad guys time to wonder whether you might be over-compensating for something.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/731310/extras/601691c729f8ff07876044d1986bd063.avif?t=1600090834\" width=66 height=66 /></span><br><strong>Space Batteries</strong> – Not sure what space batteries are?

The most time consuming part is all the paperwork.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/731310/extras/43605a72ab07a186f7662a7b267e7977.avif?t=1600090834\" width=66 height=66 /></span><br><strong>Repair Droids</strong> – At some point someone’s going to scratch the paintwork on your spaceship, who’s going to go and fix it? Not me! Repair robots are cheap, disposable and you can turn the volume down when they start to complain.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/731310/extras/c24ec5e09c9acbe44b76400db0493645.avif?t=1600090834\" width=66 height=66 /></span><br><strong>Shell Guns</strong> – These weapons will be your main way of attacking, they come in a variety of styles to suit your opponents. Some are more effective at destroying things at range, some are better at getting groups of enemies. We’ve found these to be far more effective than diplomatic negotiations.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/731310/extras/8e5ba0606583bcc2e94abaa3f77c1b5b.avif?t=1600090834\" width=66 height=66 /></span><br><strong>Warp Speed</strong> – Sometimes you just need to be somewhere else really, really quickly. I’m not running away! It’s a tactical decision.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/731310/extras/f9f6d30fddd655049ecf38af376d0003.avif?t=1600090834\" width=66 height=66 /></span><br><strong>Energy Room</strong> – There are no hairdryers on this ship but too much has been plugged in. Dave down the corridor must have left all the laser guns on again, lucky we brought some batteries to help charge up the energy.
