    "description": "Chime was a much-loved music puzzle game on Xbox Live Arcade, PC and PS3. What happens if you file away the rusty edges? <br />\r\nNew music + new modes + new visuals = CHIME SHARP.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlace pieces, paint the board, make music. Chime Sharp is an sequel to 2009's Chime, a music puzzle game with an addictive, ambient heartbeat. You tessellate shapes to cover a grid, while a beatline reads those shapes as notes. As you cover the board the music builds to a beautiful crescendo of your own design. The only way to discover Chime is to play it, but if you want a glimpse, consider what it might feel like to cross Tetris, a music sequencer and a hypnotic dream about your favourite pop song.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChime Sharp takes Chime's classic dynamic and updates it for 2015. The core rules are the same but the aesthetic is clean and modern and the game's soundtrack has been completely refreshed. With twelve new levels, experimental modes, new-era connectivity and sharper ways to play, Chime's finally back -- and it wants to be your new favourite mixtape.",
