    "description": "Dragon Fin Soup seamlessly blends genres to create a fresh experience: half story-driven tactical RPG and half high-stakes roguelike, with a pinch of crass humor and a heaping helping of murder &amp; madness set in a procedurally generated fantasy world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMeet Red Robin - a charming, yet raging alcoholic bounty hunter, who’d rather get into a bar fight than deliver baked goods. Players must take up Robin’s blades and set out across Asura, a lushly colorful fantasy world that sits on the back of an enormous space turtle, on a journey to discover the secrets of her bloody past. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWARNING!!!<br />\r\nThis game is not for the casual player and can be highly addictive. <br />\r\nDragon Fin Soup contains the following: <br />\r\n- Superfluid turn-based tactical combat <br />\r\n- Raging alcoholic bounty hunter heroine<br />\r\n- New procedurally generated world each time you play<br />\r\n- Mercenaries for hire and awesome pets to collect<br />\r\n- Over 60+ hours of roguelike gameplay in Story, Survival &amp; Labyrinth modes<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDragon Fin Soup is hand crafted by a 5 person indie development team - Grimm Bros LLC. <br />\r\nLearn more about Dragon Fin Soup at www.DragonFinSoup.com!",
