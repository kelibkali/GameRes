    "description": "mani yugi TOKOYO is a pixel art shooting game inspired by the Japanese Buddhist worldview. In it, players become a priest who gets into a mokugyo (a Buddhist temple block) and goes on a journey around the Rokudo. Players can choose from six stages, Tendo (heaven), Ningendo (human world), Chikshodo (animal world), Jigokudo (hell), Gakido (hungry world), and Syurado (fighting world), where they save wandering souls using the power of &quot;Yoshi Yoshi&quot; (there there) launched from the mokugyo. The goal of each stage is to reach the Kannon waiting for you at the end.The game also includes collectable elements, where delivered souls are gathered around the temple. <br />\r\nThe purpose of this game is to reach its final stage, TOKOYO (the place of the truth).",
