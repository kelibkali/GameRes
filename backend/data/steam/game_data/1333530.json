Just like a real conversation. <br><br>Become an employee of Nanomax, a well-funded tech start-up looking to change the face of consumer AI  with its upcoming Acolyte application.  As a remote-worker for the company, you'll interact with its employees and absorb its culture. But unexplained firings, missing employees and a strange, highly-classified bug in the Acolyte code-base point to something being very wrong.    <br><br>As you work with your new Acolyte, who seems to be intrinsically caught up in the company’s problems, you’ll find yourself at the very heart of the conspiracy. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1333530/extras/5ec9db4b8509b0e718356a07cd2b3687.poster.avif?t=1656445223\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1333530/extras/5ec9db4b8509b0e718356a07cd2b3687.webm?t=1656445223\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1333530/extras/5ec9db4b8509b0e718356a07cd2b3687.mp4?t=1656445223\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1333530/extras/a52cc5c53669bbe67723b2e1427e8e87.avif?t=1656445223\" width=630 height=122 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >//FEATURES</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>//NATURAL LANGUAGE INPUT </strong>- interact freely with your Acolyte, using your own words to advance a non-linear narrative. <br></li><li><strong>//BECOME A PART OF THE STORY</strong> - the worlds of the game and your own will blur, with ARG elements that contribute to a sprawling real-world narrative.  <br></li><li><strong>//INNOVATIVE PUZZLES</strong> - use your Acolyte to help solve puzzles that require out-of-the-box-thinking, as you dig deep into its programming.<br></li><li><strong>//CUSTOMISE YOUR ACOLYTE</strong> - personalise how your Acolyte looks and interacts, as you tailor your assistant to your preferences.<br></li><li><strong>//UNRAVEL THE CONSPIRACY </strong>- uncover a dark truth as you dig into the past of your employer. </li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1333530/extras/0013438989fafb35a1b97fd4cd649d26.poster.avif?t=1656445223\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1333530/extras/0013438989fafb35a1b97fd4cd649d26.webm?t=1656445223\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1333530/extras/0013438989fafb35a1b97fd4cd649d26.mp4?t=1656445223\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >//ABOUT SPIRIT AI</h2>Acolyte is powered by the Spirit AI Character Engine, allowing for natural language interaction with the game.
