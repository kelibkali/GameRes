Brilliant burglars and easygoing farmers.<br>Now<br><i>   The Complete Book of Gnomes and Halflings</i>   reveals the secrets of these two popular races - their culture, beliefs, and subraces (including two new subraces), as well as 28 new character kits, from the gnome Goblinsticker to the halfling Forestwalker.<br>If you enjoy playing gnome or halfling characters, or if you're a DM interested in creating an all-gnome or all-halfling campaign, this is the book for you!<br><i>   </i>   <i> </i>   <i> <strong> We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today. Some older content may reflect ethnic, racial, and gender prejudice that were commonplace in American society at that time. These depictions were wrong then and are wrong today. This content is presented as it was originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed. Dungeons &amp; Dragons teaches that diversity is a strength, and we strive to make our D&amp;D products as welcoming and inclusive as possible. This part of our work will never end.</strong> </i><br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Mike Wilson</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the D&amp;D Classics - AD&amp;D 1E/2E ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
