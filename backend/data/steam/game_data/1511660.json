    "description": "<strong>Woo Wop Da Bam</strong> is a battle royale game where the player uses flying cars that emit barriers to crash other players.<br><br>What does <strong>Woo Wop Da Bam</strong> mean? Well, the internet will tell you it is a Chicago slang for the term &quot;whatever&quot;, but it was used as a replacement for the phrase &quot;All of a Sudden&quot; where the developer grew up. I felt it fitting that a game having flying cars suddenly smacking into walls at high speed have a name like <strong>Woo Wop Da Bam</strong>",
