During his travels across land and sea, it has been a loyal companion - as keen for fresh blood as its carrier.   <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1397380/extras/09b4b91314148db3dadeeb63c942f5e9.avif?t=1723708974\" width=384 height=216 /></span><br><br><strong><u>Seinan Sharpshooter </u></strong>                                                                                                                                                    <br>The Ronin briefly fought with the last samurai during the Seinan War, pledging himself to Saigō Takamori. There, he gained notoriety for his deadly use of his Springfield 1866, one of the most advanced weapons on the field.   <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1397380/extras/5e538990ed49d84ffb51dca9f1f4fc2c.avif?t=1723708974\" width=384 height=93 /></span><br><br><strong><u>The Ronin </u></strong><br>Inuta Bakin had barely sworn his oath of allegiance before the Tokugawa shogunate was disposed. Without a master, he has wandered further than most Ronin, seeking the power to take revenge. Something of a traditionalist, he dresses and fights in a style stretching back centuries, but still effective: his leering Oni mask has been the last sight of many to fall in the bayou.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1397380/extras/58086ec28b2212eaa6c8a4b401fd207a.avif?t=1723708974\" width=165 height=317 /></span>",
