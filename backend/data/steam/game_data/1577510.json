Built for mystery. Built for you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1577510/extras/fba2981660f2af720316517a3af63d21.avif?t=1747000373\" width=616 height=411 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Go where you want. Figure it out yourself.</strong><br>There are no markers, no glowing paths, no objective spam.<br>In The Wickie, you [i]truly explore[/i]—on foot, through tunnels, across broken bridges and rusted cable lines.<br>From the storm-swept cliffs to a forgotten village, the Outer Hebrides are yours to decipher.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Every route hides a story.

Switches. Conveyors. Control panels.</strong> <br>Puzzle design in Version 2.0 is deeper and more integrated into the environment.<br>Early on, you’ll reroute a skull through industrial conveyors just to open a door. Later, you’ll need to decode binary systems or manipulate magnetic lifts while being stalked by something else in the dark.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Some puzzles are mechanical.

The sea is rising.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >In The Wickie, you play as Bill Fisher, a replacement assistant on a remote island station in the Outer Hebrides.<br>What begins as a lonely assignment becomes a descent into mystery, control, and a slow cosmic unraveling.<br>The game is not a run-and-gun horror title. It’s a meditative, dread-laced mystery, with systems that reward perception over reflex.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>🕯 Features</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i><strong>Five handcrafted days of story progression</strong>—explore, piece together the mystery, and survive. </i><br><strong>No maps. No handholding.</strong> Use clues, logic, and your own notes to navigate. <br><i><strong>Real-time exploration across an interconnected world:</strong> tunnels, walkways, derelict facilities, sea routes, and sealed rooms. </i><br><strong>A haunting atmosphere</strong> that blends Lovecraft, Machen, and weird British horror. <br><i><strong>Physical documents, posters, tapes, and diagrams</strong>—no quest pop-ups or dialogue trees. </i><br><strong>Three distinct endings</strong> based on your choices, failures, and the truths you uncover. <br><i>Fully integrated 1930s radio station featuring curated music, news, and strange broadcasts. </i><br> </p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Why Play The Wickie?</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You love immersive worlds and environmental storytelling. <br><i>You want to feel like a true investigator—not just follow quest markers. </i><br>You enjoy puzzles that respect your intelligence. <br><i>You crave that “what did I just see?” moment. </i><br>You want a game that whispers instead of screams. <br><i>You enjoy the unsettling pleasures of cosmic horror. </i><br>You want to play something personal, strange, and singular. </p></li></ul>",
