    "description": "<strong>As a Steam approved educational project, R.A.T.S. was created by a team of programming, art, and audio engineering students over a period of 5 months at Full Sail University.</strong><br><br>In the future, the Galactic Alliance have found a way to use stellar phenomena to harness renewable energy for the galaxy.  Unfortunately, a group of mercenaries who want to see the end of the Galactic Alliance are trying to make these stars go supernova, as a way of overtaking the Galactic Alliance and ultimately, rule the galaxy themselves.  You take control of the Regulatory Astro-Topographical Stabilizer, a ship that uses a heavy arsenal to defend these stars at all costs.  Your mission is to eliminate the enemy forces, take their ships' energy and overload the power-leeching pylons in order to prevent the star from being destroyed!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >This Game Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 30 Exciting Levels<br></li><li> 3 Upgradeable Weapons<br></li><li> Epic Boss Battles<br></li><li> Beat Detection For the Exciting Soundtrack<br></li><li> 7 Unique and Challenging Enemy Types<br></li><li> An Addictive Gameplay Experience</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>About I.E.D.
