    "description": "The pink for disappeared about a year ago. The world had changed forever. We no longer lived – we survived. We had been surviving on food stolen from the nearest shops for over a year. This was done by the whole camp. And if it hadn't been for a terrible collision nearly half a year ago, there would be twice as many people... At that time we still had hope and faith in others – we thought that the world would change for the better. Now all hope was lost. <br><strong>What happened to the world and the characters you love - find out after the end of the Sixtieth Kilometer.</strong>",
