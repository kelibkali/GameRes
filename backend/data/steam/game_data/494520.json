    "description": "When first designed in 1947, the Douglas Skyray™ was on the cutting edge of aviation technology. In 1948, Douglas Aircraft™ was contracted to build the F4D-1™, with the first flight of a production model taking place in 1954. Known as the 'ten-minute killer', the aircraft broke five world records in the time-to-altitude category and exceeded Mach 1 in level flight. In 1953, the Skyray™ shared honors with North American's Super Sabre™ in being awarded the prestigious Collier Trophy. In the late 1950s, an F4D1-equipped squadron was recognized as the top interceptor squadron in the North American Air Defense Command, an area previously dominated by Air Force aircraft. <br><br>In all, Douglas produced 421 Skyrays, including two XF4D™ prototypes. The last of the type left the El Segundo, California, plant in December, 1958. It was designated the F-6A™ in 1963 and served both Marine and Navy carrier squadrons until early 1964.<br><br>Virtavia’s Douglas F4D Skyray for FSX: Steam Edition comes with four loadout variations (including one clean), various animations, and an awesome smoke trail effect making this a welcome addition to any virtual military fleet<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features </h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>V-C self-shadowing <br></li><li>\t4 loadout variations<br></li><li>\tAuthentic virtual cockpit with animations and mousable controls<br></li><li>\tAuthentic all-xml 2D panel, custom pop-ups for autopilot and radios, fully mousable<br></li><li>\tAutomatic (on throttle) afterburner visual effect with corresponding performance boost<br></li><li>\tAnimated wingfold, tailhook, speedbrakes and 'beaver tail'<br></li><li>\tAnimated canopy (shift-e)<br></li><li>\tAuthentic flight model with checklist<br></li><li>\tRealistic, animated crew figure<br></li><li>\tAutomatic smoke trail effect<br></li><li>\tFully functional landing lights</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/494520/extras/9fe7184d2ad958dfa1df0a6bde23a944.avif?t=1537258424\" width=120 height=114 /></span>",
