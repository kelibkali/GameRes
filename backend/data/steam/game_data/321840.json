    "description": "Despite brilliance and skill, Natalie Puccile, a Special Investigations and Tactics officer with the Katajion Directorship, has spent her career watching over a listening post in the middle of deep space. After the orders that she has always dreamed of finally arrive, she finds herself in charge of a small destroyer and tasked with discovering the fate of a missing research team investigating an ancient civilization. Mystery swirls all around her as she reunites with old friends, meets emotional trials head-on, and faces the danger with new allies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the universe she knows falls apart around her, it is up to Natalie’s brilliance and the dedication of the crew of the KSS Nimross to avert a galaxy-shattering event that could spell the end of all space travel. With determination in her heart, Natalie rises to the chance to beat back the danger and perhaps find love in the twinkling lights of the distant stars.",
