    "description": "The Soundtrack of the GORSD collects the dark synth soundtrack from the game and presents it to you in lossless FLAC or not very lossless MP3's, for added atmosphere we recommend recording the music to an old walkman, and playing it back as the batteries are starting to fade.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe soundtrack is full of wistful synths that were recorded inside the cavernous skull-chamber of a long dead giant God. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe album is written and produced by James Barnard, who has previously worked on multiple game soundtracks, along with releasing albums with various bands. Since starting Springloaded, James writes music early in the game design process, believing that developing a musical identity early on is an integral part in setting the vision for the project. James also enjoys writing about himself in the third person.",
