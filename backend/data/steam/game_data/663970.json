    "description": "Giant Slayers is an epic fps with an intense and original  battle system  against giant bosses. You must quickly dodge Titan's frenetic attacks while firing accurate shots at his weak spots.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe primal gods were forgotten by humans. But now they have returned to collect thousands of sacrifices. In this post apocalyptic fantasy world, all the remaining humans are  children or teenagers, as no one else lives for long. You are the only one who can end the war between civilization and monstrosity.  Tranquility is the mother of courage. And only courage can bring peace.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAttention: For now, the game has only one level / boss. The final version will have about 13 titans. Soon, new updates.",
