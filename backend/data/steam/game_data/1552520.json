    "description": "At the Dawn of Human Civilization the Ancient Titans constructed a inescapable multi dimensional prison known as the Tartarus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA endless dungeon of torment and suffering where souls are judged after death and where the wicked received divine punishment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLocated deep beneath the Underworld within the Eternal Abyss.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInhabited by Primordial Demons, Spirits, Entities and imprisoned Titans. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour goal as an Envoy is to explore, conquer, find allies and uncover its secrets. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRe-engineering the technology found throughout the labyrinth and slowly learning how to navigate the portal system once used by the Titans to travel the multiverse.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlong the way you will encounter a vast variety of obstacles; traps, puzzles and challenges. That will test the limits of your abilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhere you will be awarded with an array of equipment, weapons, spells and abilities. That the Envoy can switch between at will.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe possibilities are limitless, however time is of the essence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor the Tartarus gets progressively more difficult the longer you remain within it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Escherion Research Collective is not responsible for anyone that may become imprisoned.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs we merely provide the interface in which you may project your consciousness into this ethereal realm using the Echelon system.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhich restarts, manipulates and stores all the information found throughout the Tartarus. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nImproving our ability to process, navigate and organize the chaos, which allows us to constantly upgrade our systems. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe're searching for anyone willing to join us on our explorations into the Eternal Abyss.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInterested in rediscovering the lost secrets of the Ancients and searching for a way into the Multiverse.",
