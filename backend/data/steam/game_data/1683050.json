You are alone on a spaceship and have to survive long enough to get the lifeboat up and running and escape from the horror. There are some Rogue-like elements, since your objectives and the items you find in a level are randomized.<br><br>The initial release contains a three part tutorial to get you familiar with the game concepts and three different levels for the main game. Replay value is achieved by combining the rogue-like elements with several difficulty levels.<br><br><strong>Initial Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 2D stealthy survival horror gameplay<br></li><li> 3 tutorial levels<br></li><li> 3 different levels for the single player &quot;Last Survivor&quot; mode.<br></li><li> Rogue-like randomized objectives and item placements<br></li><li> 3 difficulty levels</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1683050/extras/22ba466c71ecf3034af6cade66dd6c88.poster.avif?t=1683760559\" width=384 height=216 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1683050/extras/22ba466c71ecf3034af6cade66dd6c88.webm?t=1683760559\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1683050/extras/22ba466c71ecf3034af6cade66dd6c88.mp4?t=1683760559\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Early access?</strong><br>Once the basic gameplay works (&quot;Last Survivor&quot; mode), there are several directions I could take the game:<br><br><i>&quot;Fire Team (single player)&quot;</i>: Survive with a team of four characters to add tactical depth to the game and allow more complex game play?<br><br><i>&quot;Fire Team (couch co-op)&quot;</i>: This would also make couch co-op possible - why control all heroes when you can survive together with some friends?<br><br><i>&quot;Escape from Hallas Prime&quot;</i>: Or maybe focus on single player and add a story campaign with NPCs, in-engine cutscenes and more complex gameplay?<br><br>This is where your opinion comes in - if you like the gameplay and would like to see the game grow, which direction should I take?",
