Breathing comes naturally, at first. And then the tickle of a hundred nanites filtering your oxygen forces a cough or two of surprise.  Beneath new skin, a fresh infusion of blood pulses with the cadence of tribal drums.  Your thoughts cascade and it all makes sense again.  You open your eyes to the dull interior of a starship. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552260/extras/7311ccb8ca77b9efb25552f7151fd98b.avif?t=1757701750\" width=600 height=72 /></span><br>   </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Hello, Voyager.

Players carve out their own existence in a living, breathing sci-fi economy, complete with corporate intrigue, political upheaval, and real-time emergent storytelling. Will you rise to power as a corporate mogul, orchestrating hostile takeovers and stock market plays? Will you command fleets in war, reshaping the balance of power? Or maybe you’ll just open a bar, pour drinks, and listen to the rumors of a galaxy in motion.   </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552260/extras/4bea3c54f63d1a92d94696483252ee8f.poster.avif?t=1757701750\" width=600 height=263 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552260/extras/4bea3c54f63d1a92d94696483252ee8f.webm?t=1757701750\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>platform &amp; aesthetics</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Our native platform, RogueSpace, is a simple take on social networking.
