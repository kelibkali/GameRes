The craft is empty. Self defense systems are on high alert. Something is not right. <br><br>Get from the teleportation room to the bridge in time to diagnose the problem, regroup with the crew, and get home.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >4-times the game!</h2><br>The sequel to 1 Screen Platformer is bigger in every way. Here is how it compares to the original.<br><br><strong>Size:</strong><br>1SP 1 is 960 x 540px in size<br>1SP 2 is 1920x1080px in size<br>If you are doing the math, you will know that it is an extra 1,555,200 pixels for you to explore. That is a good deal if you ask me.<br><br><strong>Characters:</strong><br>1SP 1: 5 Playable characters<br>1SP 2: 8 Playable characters<br><br><strong>Level design:</strong><br>1SP 1: Level is static with little change between characters<br>1SP 2: 8 Playable characters where each level is drastically different. <br><br><strong>Achievements:</strong><br>1SP 1: 90<br>1SP 2: 100<br><br>Ok I know it would make sense for me to have 400 achievements for this game. But Valve only lets me have 100 achievements for my game. I don't make the rules I just follow them.  I don't know, talk to Gaben about this one.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Compete for the fastest time </h2><br>You new to speedrunning and looking for a smaller game to practice your craft? 1 Screen Platformer is great for that. There are many ways to compete and run times are less than 30 minutes. <br><br>The game also features leaderboards to keep track of your times.",
