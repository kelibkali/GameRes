    "description": "Haven Original Soundtrack includes the 19 tracks from the game’s soundtrack, composed by DANGER.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver the years, DANGER has outgrown his status as just an artist to become a global phenomenon. In keeping an anonymous stage persona since the start of his career and never revealing his identity, DANGER has constructed a dark and mysterious universe that contributes to the spectacular nature of his music. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the Haven original soundtrack, DANGER returns to his electro synthwave music style, adding more positive and colorful vibes to it, as well as elements of Vaporwave and Funk music, mixed with a new orchestral dimension. “While so far I’ve been more interested in exploring the nightmare zone in my music, the Haven soundtrack gave me the chance to explore other, brighter aspects of childhood.” explains DANGER.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n19 tracks, 92 mn. Includes MP3 and FLAC files.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou'll find the files in you Steam directory upon purchase: ...Steam\\steamapps\\music\\Haven Soundtrack",
