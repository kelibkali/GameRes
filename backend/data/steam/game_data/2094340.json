    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This game is based on Fire Emblem and is extremely similar to the previous game I made, except much simpler. I've taken out all the unnecessary hustles, and you should progress the storyline fair quickly as there isn't much of a story. The game itself is just a typical tactical RPG with only 6 playable characters and 11 chapters in total, should take you an hour to finish. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Most characters can promote once they reach level 10 and learn skills at level 5 and 15, hope you enjoy!</p>",
