    "description": "Damon Blood only cares about clearing the bricks so that he can make his way to his opponent on the other side hiding behind that paddle. But he knows that if he can avoid the blow attacks and get close enough that his enemies blood will spurt into the air with a quick strike!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDriving his deadly sharp knife into his opponent is the only way Damon see's to finally make right of all the wrong in his young life. He doesn't see Dante, Andy, Angela or Deborah as who they are. Damon purposely landed himself here in prison because every inmate he sees as the haunting image of his own father who took the life of his mother five years ago! Filling his blood meter with blood is the only way Damon can score any points in his troubled mind, and his opponents better be concerned about more than hitting those little blue balls once he arrives!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUse the action button to swap Damon from using his paddle to wielding his knife and hunting his opponent for blood.  While in hunting mode, you'll need to make your away through the bricks and getting his by your opponents blow attack while make you drop your knife and leave you dazed and confused.  Strike your opponent when close using your action button to draw blood.  The more you fill your blood meter by spreading your opponents blood all over the screen with the help of the moving balls, the more points you'll score for each brick broken when using your paddle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlaying against Damon will test your skills at handling and managing your blow attack.  Remember that Angela Diaz now has a new special ability called &quot;Auto Blow&quot; that helps her land blow attacks and this might help you survive the blood thirsty Damon!  Getting stabbed will cause your character to spray blood and lose both movement speed and the ability to use your blow attack.  Both breaking bricks and time will heal your wounds and slowly stop your bleeding wounds.",
