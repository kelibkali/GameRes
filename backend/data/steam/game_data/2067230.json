    "description": "Skellington is a cute 3D platformer starring a goofy skeleton who just wants to go back to sleep!<br />\r\nUnfortunately, a child has been robbed of their halloween candy by ghosts and is crying uncontrollably in the graveyard... Our friendly skeleton hero will go on a quest to collect all of the candy, return it to the child and finally get his well-deserved rest!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe candy has been scattered around 8 different worlds, accessed by the gravestones of the ghosts.<br />\r\nRun through these worlds and use your platforming skills to find all hidden candies!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe pumpkins can be a tricky bunch, some are very nice, and contain lots of candy!<br />\r\nOthers, eh... Not so much.<br />\r\nLearn about all of the pumpkin types and use their abilities to your advantage!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMoving platforms are often scattered around in these worlds!<br />\r\nMaster your platforming abilities and make your way through these obstacle course-like levels!",
