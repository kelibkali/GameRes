    "description": "Break free from your room and take combat to the skies! HVR is a VR experiment inspired by Marvel’s Iron Man designed to push the boundaries of VR locomotion by providing a way for players to experience free flight and 360-degree aerial combat without a cockpit.<br><br>HVR puts you inside of an armored suit and straps jetpacks to your hands that let you fly, dodge, and shoot in all directions! Live your dreams of being a superhero and take on a horde of enemy fighter jets that won’t give up without a fight.<br><br>If you liked this or have feedback, please direct them to the HVR Demo Community Discussion page: <br><br>I'd love to make this a full game if there's enough interest and support from the community!<br><br>Special thanks to Jabili, Austin, Jared, Zach, Sean, Rohan, and Ramya for providing feedback and helping test.",
