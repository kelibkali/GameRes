Guide Glover and the balls through seven magical worlds full of puzzles and hidden surprises. Watch out! The evil glove is lurking in the shadows, and he'll stop at nothing to foil Glover's attempts at restoring peace.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>30 levels to explore across six unique worlds<br></li><li>Innovative duo of Glover and ball<br></li><li>Clever themed puzzles that require the use of both glove and ball<br></li><li>Inspiring power-ups!
