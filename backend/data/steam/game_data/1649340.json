    "description": "<strong>A Strategy Board Game Like No Other</strong><br><br>The rolling hills of the battlefield lay before you as you carefully move your units into position. The clock is ticking, and the enemy is already attacking the vulnerable city near the center of the board with bomber units. Will you pull off your attack and annihilate the enemy? Or will you be outsmarted by your cunning opponent?<br><br>From the studio that created the <i>Harpoon</i> series comes this unique real-time strategy game set on a surreal tile-based board game battlefield. Wage war over three eras of combat: Clash swords and loose arrows in Medieval style, roll tanks and march infantry to victory in the Great War setting, and take to the skies with aerial units in the Contemporary mode. Each battle setting has its own unique set of pre-arranged battle scenarios to test your ability to use each unit’s strengths to your advantage, and to guard against their weaknesses. Put your strategic abilities to the ultimate test!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Engage your opponent in a game that looks like Chess, but plays like a real-time strategy game with individual unit stats, projectile attacks, and the ability to move multiple pieces simultaneously.<br></li><li>Gain the advantage by adjusting your view of the battlefield between a 3D angle and an overhead tactical perspective. Zoom in and out, and pan the camera around the battlefield to find and engage your enemy.<br></li><li>Play against the computer in 35 designed scenarios, or compete against a friend in the local two player versus mode.</li></ul><br><i>Note: Original network multiplayer modes are included but, due to the age of this title, not supported for this release.</i>",
