Over time, you can buy any house you want in the city and furnish it with better furniture.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Born to Manage a Game Company</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Your main goal is to manage a game company. To do this, you will need professionals who are experts in their fields. You can either improve yourself by obtaining certificates online and become a one-person developer, or you can hire workers and assign them various tasks. If you prefer, you can complete your games by using simpler solutions, or you can manage the same company together with your real-life friends.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1652400/extras/88d5484b81e9bb4b2b9e589b9956658c.poster.avif?t=1768715178\" width=544 height=306 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1652400/extras/88d5484b81e9bb4b2b9e589b9956658c.webm?t=1768715178\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1652400/extras/88d5484b81e9bb4b2b9e589b9956658c.mp4?t=1768715178\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Quality Equipment, Quality Work</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >By upgrading your equipment, you can create higher-quality work. High-quality games mean more earnings. Every item is interactable. You can upgrade not only your computer but also the furniture in your home to create a more comfortable living space.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>The Tricks of Making Games</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The unique aspect of Developer Daily compared to other game-development games on the market is not just that you control a single character with an FPS/TPS camera. It’s the complete flexibility of your game-creation options. We don’t force you into anything during development. You decide what your game will include. However, you must take your team’s skills into account and pay attention to what is trending in the market. In fact, sometimes you may need to create certain types of games not because they sell well, but because the bonuses they provide support your long-term strategies.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1652400/extras/415051cd5bf62148b500e357a6309fbb.poster.avif?t=1768715178\" width=544 height=306 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1652400/extras/415051cd5bf62148b500e357a6309fbb.webm?t=1768715178\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1652400/extras/415051cd5bf62148b500e357a6309fbb.mp4?t=1768715178\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Management Brings Competition</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Whether they are NPCs or your friends, you must pay attention to the people working with you. Randomly generated tasks may tempt them, and they might take actions that harm the company in order to earn more money. You can also use the same tactics against rival companies, forcing them to sell their shares at a lower price.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Ways to Create Various Assets</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >To create a game, you need to fill it with assets. Each asset has its own mini-game, and you must complete these mini-games to produce them. If this type of work becomes tedious for you, there are many features that can make your job easier. As you progress, you can even get rid of these tasks entirely and focus solely on managing your companies.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1652400/extras/353366f285944de636d4fc1c0e5c1e07.poster.avif?t=1768715178\" width=544 height=306 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1652400/extras/353366f285944de636d4fc1c0e5c1e07.webm?t=1768715178\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1652400/extras/353366f285944de636d4fc1c0e5c1e07.mp4?t=1768715178\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Real-Time Cycle</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Bills, rent, and worker expenses.
