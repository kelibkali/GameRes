Also called the Sun King for his luxurious tastes and extravagant appearances, he is driven by the belief that the sun – his sun – should shine upon all peoples of the world. His enemies are as numerous as the stars but it is the moon that reigns the <br>night. Poisoned and left for dead, Louis’s bastard son emerges from the smoke and ashes of Germany’s battlefields under the guise of the Moon King. With hatred festering in his heart, he has employed the aid of diabolical and forbidden sciences to build an army the likes of which the world had not seen since the days of Lucifer’s rebellion. <br>Now the dead rise from their mass graves, seeking vengeance upon the king that demanded their deaths while he basked in glory. Can you, the Sun King’s bravest musketeer, stop the approaching eclipse before it swallows the sun? <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1253520/extras/d282f0bca4dc64cdae92fc6dc2947e0f.poster.avif?t=1621931489\" width=616 height=250 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1253520/extras/d282f0bca4dc64cdae92fc6dc2947e0f.webm?t=1621931489\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1253520/extras/d282f0bca4dc64cdae92fc6dc2947e0f.mp4?t=1621931489\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Rules</h2></strong>Timing your actions is critical to success in this game, as a correctly timed jump or attack can be the difference between glorious victory and shameful defeat. Furthermore, studying and understanding your enemies will be of utter importance. Only by getting to know your demons can you hope to find their weaknesses – and exploit them. For instance, many foes can hurt not just you but also each other. Goading them into slaughtering their own is often vital to success.<br>Lastly, a word of warning: The Moon King's army is not composed of conventional soldiers. These are the living dead, and simply killing them once is not enough to guarantee their surrender. There is only one antidote against the cancer of undeath: gunpowder and shot. Landing the killing blow with your musket will tear apart the body and make further resurrection impossible. Keep in mind that you can also shoot corpses before they revive.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1253520/extras/0ae7f082c10de7cf8d29f9056a50c7bd.poster.avif?t=1621931489\" width=616 height=250 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1253520/extras/0ae7f082c10de7cf8d29f9056a50c7bd.webm?t=1621931489\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1253520/extras/0ae7f082c10de7cf8d29f9056a50c7bd.mp4?t=1621931489\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About</h2></strong>Development on the game began in January, 2018. The feature we worked the longest on is the musket. There was hardly a precedent from other games for a similar mechanic, so we could not simply take an existing mechanic and put our own spin on it. Instead it was necessary to dive into and really understand the 17th century in order to transform the historical rules of early gunpowder weapons into a viable gameplay mechanic for a 2D action platformer. We spent a lot of time visiting museums and poring over books in order to make the game as authentic as we could. After we had a foundation that is accurate, we set free our creativity and created a typical &quot;Andrade Game&quot; that is always an interplay between history and morbid phantasy. <br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Die, have fun, die again!</h2></strong>",
