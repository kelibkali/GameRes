    "description": "Digital Diamond Baseball is a computerized baseball simulator that allows gamers to play individual games, series, or entire seasons, using players from any baseball season in history. Never pay for a new season again!

The game is packed with features such as real-life transactions, as-played lineups, sophisticated manager profiles, fictional players, career projections, tournaments, and the ability to customize ball park images, player photos, play-by-play calls, and sound.",
