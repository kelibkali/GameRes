    "description": "<strong>INDIE FANTASY LOCAL MULTIPLAYER GAME FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY, SET UP ON THE WORLD OF ETERNALIA</strong><br><br>Two games in one; Classic Arcade mode and First Person Medieval Shooter. There might be a third mode coming if you people like the videogame; a party RPG, integrating the story of the Essence Reaper Ritual with the mechanics of this videogame. You decide!<br><br>FEATURES AND CONTENTS<br>- Local multiplayer fantasy game, for 1-4 players, sharing same screen. <br>- Steam Play Together. Invite your friends to play with you even if they dont own a copy. <br>- An Arcade mode campaign, to play with your friends or solo. Hack and Slash. <br>- A First Person mode, following the same campaign than that of the Arcade mode. <br>- An Arena mode; gather your party, venture forth and face five waves of enemies, each wave of increasing difficulty. <br>- 5 different characters, each one with their uniques skills and combat styles. <br>- Subttile and menus in three different languages; English, French and Spanish. <br>- Beta version will have one full playable level. As we move forward, up to 4 more leves will be added. <br>- Each level is set up in a different atmosphere, with different enemies. <br><br>The idea of creating this videogame came in when spending time with our young family members (e.g. nephews and niece) playing a videogame. It should be easy to play, not too many buttons, yet plenty of fun. We are scripting from the very beginning everything to accommodate three languages; English, French and Spanish, so the videogame will be available en those three languages.<br><br>We just give you for now a video and a couple of screen capture of the first tests.<br><br>We are thinking on adding a script to be able to import your own pictures to the game, so instead of having the 4 portraits of each character, you may import yours. I bet my niece and nephews would love that.<br><br>Alpha version of the videogame, actual game play, is working well.<br><br><br><br>Initial early version: integrating First Person Mode on split screen with main campaign, for up to 4 players;<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1278580/extras/SplitScreen3x600x441.PNG?t=1606670571\" /></span><br><br><strong>GAME CONTROLLERS</strong><br><br>You may use;<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Xbox One controllers or similar<br></li><li> Keyboard &amp; Mouse</li></ul> <br><br><br><br><strong>LOCALISATION</strong><br><br>I have been integrating different languages from the very beginning of programming / development. I use Dialogue System from Pixel Crushers which allows easy integration, and for specific short texts as in the Main Menu, I have just hardcode it. Once you choose a language, Dialogue System keeps / save that info for the entire videgame, so upon load an scene, Dialogue System load all previous saved data including language chosen.",
