    "description": "Designed from the ground up Ancient Battle: Rome gives a unique wargaming experience. Use Roman legionaries, elephants, catapults, heavy and light cavalry, archers, slingers, fanatics and many other unit types to engage in classic battles. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game features a total of 63 missions, including 'Caesars campaign in Gaul' culminating in the classic siege of Alesia, and the campaign between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great, including the battle of Pharsalus. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new Mac edition includes all the campaigns from the iOS version such as the invasion of Brittania with the highlight of Queen Boudicca's demise at the battle of Verulamum, and Germania with the Roman massacre at Teutoburger Wald. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt also includes the infamous Parthia campaign where a whole Roman army perished in the desert and the Pontic campaign against Mithridates the Great. These later campaigns add fully armoured cataphracts, light and scythed chariots, light cavalry archers and the Greek Pike Phalanx to the game system.",
