You must help guide the King's button back to his rightful owner, all while avoiding the swords, axes, and other medieval nightmares that have been awakened by the runaway magic that dissipated off the King. Journey through the long, winding corridors of the castle as you navigate the King's button around enemies, traps, and hazards. Test your reflexes in this tough-as-nails, &quot;old school&quot; hard, top-down, action adventure challenge!",
