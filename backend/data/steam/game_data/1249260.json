One school. Six deaths.</strong> You are Pandora, the mastermind behind a game where everyone puts their life on the line. Your goal is simple: you must figure out who the traitor is and kill them, and then end the game before someone figures out you are the one behind their abduction and kills <strong>you</strong>. Will you manage to manipulate everyone's trust to fulfill your plans? Or will you fail and be erased? Even the mastermind behind a death game does not always know how the events will go...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Solve puzzles and hack for information!</strong> As the mastermind of the death game, you have the ability to hack into other characters' helmets to see what they see and hear what they hear. Use that knowledge to keep ahead of the participants!<br></li><li><strong>Use TRUST to radically change the story!</strong> By making different choices, you can change which characters you have TRUST with, which will lead to different outcomes. Only by trying different things will you attain new story routes!<br></li><li><strong>Mandatory autosaving: choices matter!</strong> Once you've made a choice for your save file, that choice is locked in. Be sure to weight your options or else you may end up with devastating outcomes! Thankfully, the game comes equipped with <strong>24 file slots</strong> to let you retry.<br></li><li><strong>One flowchart to use with each new file!</strong> Equipped with a complex flowchart, you can change your choices on the fly in any new blank save file as long as all options for a given choice have been previously done. You can think of it as one bigger puzzle where you change choices to access new routes and dive in at any unlocked point! The one in control of the flow is YOU.<br></li><li><strong>The game remembers what you've done!</strong> While each save file is a separate route, the game takes into account all that you've done and remembers. Perhaps even, revisiting older saves at a later time may unlock additional content for that file...</li></ul><br>Note: Only 16:9 resolution ratio is fully supported.",
