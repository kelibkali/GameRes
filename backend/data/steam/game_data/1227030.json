    "description": "Sunrider Girls Add-On<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe captain has crashed the ship, and so the girls of the Sunrider must work as idols to buy a new one?! Help Ava, Asaga, Chigara, Icari, and Sola succeed in the entertainment business with this supplemental DLC pack. Add your favorite Sunrider girl to your idol roster. Pick them as the center of your unit to utilize brand new bonuses. Power up your talent office by unleashing their ultimate techniques. None of this makes a lot of sense, but you asked for it, so here it is!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis DLC adds FIVE new hirable idols to Shining Song Starnova: IDOL EMPIRE.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAVA CRESCENTIA<br />\r\nThe commander of the former Sunrider. She is a strict and professional executive officer, but nobody knew that her secret hobby was karaoke! She is pretty annoyed that you insisted on making her into an idol, but she's got impressive singing skills from all her solo karaoke excursions. Don't screw up the paperwork, or else she'll definitely give you a long lecture.<br />\r\nIn a pinch, Ava can restore order when the fans are angry, instantly defusing the probability of a FAN QUAKE. Not only that, but she can keep discipline amongst the other girls, as well as oversee dance practices to prevent injuries. She has rock solid singing abilities, which makes up for her cold personality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nASAGA DI RYUVIA<br />\r\nThe hero of justice now seeks to become the hero of the idol world! Asaga always wanted to become a star! She'll work hard to inspire hope in the masses. With an energetic and straight forward personality, she inspires the following of a legion of supporters. Not only that, but her plugsuit cosplay is a big hit with the hardcore fans.<br />\r\nAsaga can substantially increase the performance of EVENT rooms, giving you a late game boost. Overall, she has impressive stats with no clear weaknesses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChigara Ashada<br />\r\nChigara's always been nothing but a helpful idol for a while now, but for some reason, the fans seem strangely apprehensive about her all of a sudden. Could it be that a mirror version of herself did something bad in some other universe that she's not aware of?! Lately, her popularity seems to be struggling! Despite public perceptions, Chigara will do her best to become a star! She is a gentle and smiling girl whose dream is to open a bakery. There's really nothing hidden about her this time, we swear!<br />\r\nChigara struggles to increase her popularity, but starts with impressive stats. Use her ultimate technique and she will transform the cafeteria into a bakery! Not only that, but she can use her technical expertise to help fabricate merchandise and stage effects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIcari Isidolde<br />\r\nThe deadliest mercenary of the Neutral Rim is now an idol! It just goes to show that if you pay her the credits, she's willing to take on any job, no matter the risk. While playing the role of a committed idol, Icari also keeps on the lookout for any threats, making her an invaluable part of your security team. Just remember: She's only in this for the credits. It's not like she's pretending to be an idol because she likes you or anything!<br />\r\nHiring Icari lets you buff up your security department, and she can even take out stalkers in emergency situations herself if you activate her ultimate technique. However, Icari isn't exactly the fans' spitting image of an idol, making her a competent but not standout idol.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSola di Ryuvia<br />\r\nThe soft spoken and vaguely sad Ryuvian sharr from a bygone era is now an idol of incredible feminine mystique! The fans are dying to learn more about this mysterious idol who appeared out of nowhere and gripped everyone's eyes. Honestly though, Sola is not too sure about this idol business and hasn't come to terms with working in the entertainment business yet. However, if this is necessary to get a new ship, then it seems she has no choice...<br />\r\nMaking Sola the center of your group will give you access to Lost Technology, which drastically improves the speed of researching better facilities. If the situation really calls for it, you can tell Sola to bring out her ultimate technique, the Cupid Snipe, which for some reason, causes all the fans to pass out whenever Sola does it, making the unit invulnerable to scandals while it is active.",
