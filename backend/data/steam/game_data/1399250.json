There he will face the first zombies, enter a royal tomb and <strong>explore the catacombs</strong> until he finds the exit and can quickly head towards the city.<br><br>In the second stage, when he finally reaches the city, he finds a bleak panorama: in the parks the children have already become zombies, the citizens who are still <strong>normal and the zombies share the streets</strong>. When he passed a construction site, the zombie workers tried to eat him. Some policemen turned into zombies fire their guns. Red Cap will be forced to <strong>use the subway to avoid the streets</strong> and get to the Anti-Zombies Army (AZA) office as soon as possible.<br><br>With the coins and treasures that Red Cap will find along the way in the game shop, you can buy, among other things, such fun devices as <strong>eShield</strong> (Electronic Shield), <strong>Laser Wheel</strong> or a <strong>Robot</strong> that will accompany you as your faithful friend.
