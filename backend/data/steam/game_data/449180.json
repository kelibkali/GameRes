    "description": "Meld is a mind-bending puzzle game featuring 200+ levels and a build-in editor so you can create your own and play levels made by others!  Master dozens of powerups and layers of strategy to make your way through each level. Meld features a build-in tutorial system which makes learning the rules and strategy simple!<br><br><u>Objective &amp; Gameplay</u><br>Meld features an incredibly simple set of controls. Click to move or drag elements (tiles) around the gameboard to to create a path of like-colored elements between the starting and ending terminals.  If the terminals are yellow, then a yellow path must be created.<br><br>Like-colored elements can be stacked on top of each other, and certain colored elements can be melded together to produce new colors.<br><br><u>Melding</u><br>Combining elements of different colors in called melding. Primary color elements (Red, Blue, and Yellow) can be melded together to create secondary colors.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>Red + Blue = Purple<br>    </li><li>Blue + Yellow = Green<br>    </li><li>Yellow + Red = Orange</li></ul><br><u>Powerups</u><br>As you progress in Meld, completing levels becomes much more difficult than simply creating a path. Powerups provide an added layer of strategy while increasing the depth of the game!  Below are some of the powerups you'll find in Meld. Each powerup will unlock at a certain level.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Antimatter</strong> - Changes the color of any element or element stack to its opposite color.<br></li><li><strong>Board Tile</strong> - Places an empty tile on the board at a selected location.<br></li><li><strong>Asteroid</strong> - Destroys an element and its binding. If used on an unbound element or empty bound tile, a placeable tile is awarded.<br></li><li><strong>{Color} Comet</strong> - Shoots out from a specified tile performing a single {color} meld on all valid elements it touches. (There are six colored comets: Blue, Green, Orange, Purple, Red, and Yellow.)<br></li><li><strong>Meteor</strong> - Destroys the binding on a selected tile or an element on an unbound tile.<br></li><li><strong>Pulsar</strong> - Destroys all unbound elements in a straight line away from a specified tile.<br></li><li><strong>Solar Flare</strong> - Changes the color of any element or element stack to any other color.<br></li><li><strong>Worm Hole</strong> - Connects two non-adjacent tiles and allow them to act as if they were connected.<br></li><li><strong>Superconductor</strong> - Occupies a single, empty tile and allows any color conduit to pass through it.<br></li><li><strong>Meteor Shower</strong> - Destroys the binding or unbound element on a selected tile and all six surrounding tiles.<br></li><li><strong>Planetoid</strong> - Destroys an element and the tile that holds it or a bound element and its binding. All surrounding, unbound elements are also destroyed.<br></li><li><strong>Fusion</strong> - Fuses any two elements of a different color producing special results.<br></li><li><strong>Black Hole</strong> - Occupies a single tile plus all six surrounding tiles and devours anything that enters the black hole.<br></li><li><strong>Dark Energy</strong> - Pushes all surrounding elements one tile away. Element collisions will create a fusion.<br></li><li><strong>Dark Matter</strong> - Pulls all surrounding elements two tiles away in one tile. Element collision will create a fusion.<br></li><li><strong>Supernova</strong> - Blasts out in all six directions destroying any element it hits then performs a meld on each tile according to its color.</li></ul><br><u>Level Editor</u><br>Meld features a user-friendly, built-in level editor where you can create, test, and publish your own custom levels. Once a level is published, it can be played by others who can rate the quality and difficulty of the level! See how your level compares to others that have been made!",
