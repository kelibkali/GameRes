Whenever a game begins you’ll quickly discover the only predictable element is broken bones.<br><br><strong><i>Mutant Football League</i></strong> is the bloody-fun next generation, spiritual successor to the retro classic, “Mutant League Football”, designed and produced by Michael Mendheim, the creator of the original game which means you can expect deep strategy game-play, bone crunching, tooth shattering hits, and a roster of ghouls delivering tongue-through-cheek humor.
