Everyone’s story eventually ends, and in Cataria, that is no different. Once a villager passes, their spirit will enter your town's spirit tree, which will grow with your town as more spirits pass away. This provides your villagers with a place to gather, remember their ancestors, and offer gifts to the afterlife.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1634390/extras/ecdb5a5fb8ba6b230a2d25fd4548bc90.avif?t=1762362034\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1634390/extras_big/ecdb5a5fb8ba6b230a2d25fd4548bc90.avif?t=1762362034 width=1600 height=900 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p>",
