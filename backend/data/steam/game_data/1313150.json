    "description": "&quot;The first and last Orphan to discover the unforgettable&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnchantress is a first-person psychological thriller game, Inspired by Never Again and Town of Light<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Player features Megan Sterling, the newest child to WhiteRose Orphanage during the 1930's. WhiteRose holds many dark secrets under the 'care' of a twisted Matron. A crimson trail has been left behind that must be uncovered through exploring the Orphanage, before mother finds YOU herself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main mechanics of Enchantress are through an immersive user experience. Exploring rooms, uncovering secrets and reliving untold history. Enchantress adopts a unique and innovative 20th Century style to capture the precise moments that took place, but were hidden at the time, allowing the experience to become a part of reality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnchantress is a Final Major University Project. I developed this game: levels, story and programming.",
