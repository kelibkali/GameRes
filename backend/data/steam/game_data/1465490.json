    "description": "<strong>The Last Cohort</strong><br><br>The Kingdom of Vorgunval has suffered major losses against the barbaric Skulhdor Raiders and is near total annhiliation. The Skulhdor Raiders are said to be Vikings that were banished from Iceland, but now their warmongering has led them south. When they found our kingdom to be rich in rare minerals, they plundered the villages and drove the people away. <br><br>In a last ditch effort to prevent total defeat, King Gromir has sent out a group of elite warriors on a perilous quest. Tasked with overcoming great odds, they must make the most out of any resources they can find. The only way they stand a chance to win is by exploiting the enemy's weaknesses using guile rather than brute force. <br><br>These missions will help rebuild the kingdom so that it may thrive again. The people have lost their homes, the mills are not producing food, the road blocks have halted trade, and without their forts and strongholds, the town is left defenseless.<br><br>The casualties of the war have been great, and the few who are left are starving. Though as long as hope remains, they will gladly show their support to the brave few who venture forth to drive back the evil barbarians. <br><br>These brave men will be known henceforth as The Last Cohort! <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465490/extras/23d3801649933422c2570152e3f3493f.webp?t=1674761014\" width=600 height=58 /></span><br><br>The Last Cohort is a unique blend of fast-paced Real-Time Strategy combined with more in-depth tactical planning.
