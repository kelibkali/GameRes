    "description": "Drift (Over) Drive is a retro-styled top-down racing game, which is actually not so much about racing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn DoD you take the role of a driver passionate about drifting, driving your car around the world on all kinds of environments and weather conditions, while taking on different challenges and avoiding all kinds of obstacles and hazards. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPoints are the currency, and as you drift more, longer, faster - in one word: better- you'll be able to afford new cars and upgrades, as you make your way to the ultimate competition: the Drift Stadium.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCan you drift your way into being the world's greatest drift driver?",
