    "description": "<strong>Rogue-like deck building</strong><br>Create a deck from random selections of cards in order the gain power and overcome enemy armies. If you are defeated, you start from the beginning with a new deck. Card selection is slightly limited in the demo, and cards will be unlockable in the full version of the game. <br><br><strong>Defeat enemy armies</strong><br>The goal of the game is to defeat a series of armies. Each army has a health value, and you have your own health, defense, attack, and wealth values which impact your battles with the enemy army. In this demo version, you have access to the Human faction general who gives you a unique option for how you manipulate your cards. During combat, 16 cards from your deck are played simultaneously on a field, and those cards may synergize with each other depending on their position and the attributes of surrounding cards. <br><br><strong>Other features</strong><br>Treasure items in the game can be obtained after defeating an army, and they have either instantaneous or constant effects on your cards which further help you to defeat armies. There are also &quot;faction synergies&quot; for each faction which can be activated when four cards from the same faction are played in a row or column. After the first army, enemy armies will begin to add sabotage cards to your deck for an added level of difficulty.",
