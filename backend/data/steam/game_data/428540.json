You walk alongside Will on his last morning and discover the meaning of his final thoughts. With Mary, Will’s grandmother, you learn about his childhood, their conflict, and how they ultimately reconciled some of their differences. Sarah was Will’s girlfriend and first love. She tells us how she found a deeper understanding of herself during their time together. And finally, Harry is Will’s partner when the accident happens. Can Harry ever accept the loss?",
