You're not the only one on the case though. Other knights, warriors, and ne'er-do-wells are scouring the land looking for a chance to claim the glory of beating back The Horde for themselves. The Old Kingdom is quickly fading into the annals of time, but the combatants that once heralded it's strength are as restless as ever for blood and glory!<br><br><strong><u>Battle your friends in head to head in duels</u></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Duke it out to see which one of your buddies has the greatest grit when it comes to medieval combat. Whether it be sword, spear, bow, or magic, with the right strategy, skill, and a bit of luck, you can come out on top!</li></ul><strong><u>Take on team battles as your try to capture forts from each other </u></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Sitting in a high castle doesn’t always mean safety. Fight alongside your friends and capture the enemy stronghold, demonstrating that your group has the right to rule the roost. </li></ul><strong><u>Outclass your foes by selecting from four varying playstyles </u></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Slay zombies and fellow combatants alike with the classes of Archer, Templar, Inquisitor, or Priest. Ironclad armor, piercing weaponry, skillful arrows, or arcane arts. Your playstyle, your choice!</li></ul><strong><u>Overcome hordes of zombies and struggle for top score</u></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The unrelenting waves of the undead aren’t the only obstacle you’ll have to overcome in the world of Chroma. Your fellow combatants are sometimes as bloodhungry as the zombies. Wield your weapon of choice well to ensure that you come out on top! </li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1340520/extras/f8ee52250300b6383eb5ec5cdd455f09.avif?t=1599318575\" width=600 height=200 /></span><br><strong>Templar:</strong> Physically remarkable warriors famed for their prowess in armed combat that they honed serving The Old Kingdom. While not the brightest, the Templar makes up in brawn what he lacks in brains. Big muscles for big weapons. <br><br><strong>Inquisitor:</strong> Discontented with the existing social order, the outbreak of The Horde served as the perfect pretext for the Inquisitor's emergence from the shadows. Cunning and quick, the Inquisitor can outpace the vast majority of their foes but must be wary of taking excessive physical damage. <br><br><strong>Archer:</strong> Against the slow-moving Horde the Archer leverages distance to their advantage. Bolts and quills send shivers and chills down the spines of their enemies... assuming those spines still have bloodflow. Damage from a distance is still very real damage. <br><br><strong>Priest:</strong> Salvation for the living and damnation for the undead. The Priest class served The Old Kindgom in many critical administrative capacities and reverberate it's existance, using ancient texts to conjure archaic magics. Priests cleanse the land of dark energy, both human and zombie alike.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1340520/extras/0569202bd45cce44b7dbdc2d63cc3301.avif?t=1599318575\" width=600 height=200 /></span><br>Throne Hall, where the last vestiges of the Old Kingdoms echo and their forelorn combatants pit themselves against one another. The Lowland Pasture, where the undead thrive on the rotting corpses of the fallen for as far as the eye can see... and it's your job to thin their ranks. Trial Of Might where you can test your grit against your fellow man as you sharpen your skills and blade to fight the horde, with cavernous hills and mighty walls of stone, with or without one another.",
