Delve through <strong>dungeons</strong>, take on challenging <strong>world bosses</strong> and <strong>dynamic events</strong>, or kick back by the sea shore, catching fish.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Isleward is a living game with a vibrant community, <strong>seasonal events</strong> to look forward to every few months, and more content, small and large, being released in-between.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Participate in <strong>Leagues</strong> to shake up the rules of the game and get a fresh start with some additional challenge.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" style=\"text-align: center\"><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1248830/extras/b6eda0aaa707cf8cd1d24a02ca44ff4c.avif?t=1762365815\" width=780 height=120 /></span></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >When you create a character, you first choose your guardian animal <strong>Spirit</strong>.
