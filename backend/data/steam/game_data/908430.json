    "description": "Push your brain to the limits as you push blocks around. Colliderscope is a peacefully infuriating puzzle game where you push and pull blocks to form specific shapes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver the course of Colliderscope's 50 levels, you will push, pull, and shape blocks to solve puzzles that boggle the mind while listening to a tranquil piano score.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing a flexible first person interface, Colliderscope requires that you look at its puzzles from all angles in order to solve them. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nColliderscope is a pure puzzle game without story or filler. It was designed to provide a focused, challenging experience without additional padding to increase play time. Average puzzle players can expect to spend about 3-4 hours to complete all 50 puzzles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nColliderscope will challenge you to look at blocks in a whole new way.",
