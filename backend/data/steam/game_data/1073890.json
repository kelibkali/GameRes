    "description": "Dragon Fight VR is an internal experiment by our team to capture the &quot;essence&quot; of a dragon fight, the classic penultimate experience of every fantasy story. We wanted to create a short visceral, realistic experience stripped of user interface, lobbies, scores, levels, and other visual intrusions that might distract. There were some key elements of fighting a dragon that we wanted to capture and we felt VR was uniquely qualified to convey:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Face to face with a large scale hostile creature trying to kill you<br></li><li>Using a sword and a shield<br></li><li>Fire!<br></li><li>Nowhere to run!</li></ul><br>This started out as an internal experiment to learn some things about VR’s capabilities, be reductionist in our designs, etc. We felt that the experiment was successful enough to release as a free experience to share. Enjoy!",
