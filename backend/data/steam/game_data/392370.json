His older sister Mutsuki and upperclassman Rinna are runemasters - prana users who have been defending the land of commoners since ancient times. Alas, Tenka himself has no special powers, but his daily life is about to be shattered when he starts hearing his name being called in a dream...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWish is a doujin game, or Indie game, coming to you straight from the fan and story-telling community of Japan!
