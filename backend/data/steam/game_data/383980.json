Once overheated she can no longer use her specials or hover, becoming more vulnerable to her enemies.<br></li><li>LETTING OFF STEAM - Elliana can perform Strong Attacks to expel steam away from her ship, lowering her Overheat bar. The steam can also catch opponents or be blown away by attacks. When she is overheated, her strong attacks let off a powerful explosion instead that can KO opponents.<br></li><li>ABANDON SHIP - Elliana can use her Up Special to abandon ship even when overheated. She launches herself high into the air and her ship explodes. Be careful, as she is very vulnerable while outside of her ship and she must rebuild it upon landing on the ground.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/383980/extras/ce38b1f8b45e6d9131c9c56fa896bec5.avif?t=1721063075\" width=616 height=132 /></span><br><br>Ori and Sein are from the hit indie game <i>Ori and the Blind Forest</i> and they bring their skills to the test in Rivals of Aether. While Ori works to Bash, Stomp and Glide his way to victory, Sein can use the Spirit Flame or the Charged Flame to put enemies between a rock and a hard place.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>SPIRIT FLAME – Sein follows Ori around the battlefield. Ori can tap Neutral Special to have Sein quickly fire a Spirit Flame from wherever Sein is. Ori can hold Neutral Special to have Sein use the Charged Flame.<br></li><li>BASH – Ori can use Down Special to Bash nearly anything in Rivals of Aether – from characters to projectiles to rocks and plants. Ori can also move around the stage by bashing the Light Grenade that is thrown by using Forward Special.<br></li><li>TAG TEAM – When Ori and Sein are close enough, Ori can use Strong Attacks to initiate tag team combos. These Strong Attacks have more powerful properties as Sein assists Ori for a more devastating blow.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/383980/extras/f45573342ea678f3c2e7b7b58f0009be.avif?t=1721063075\" width=616 height=138 /></span><br><br>Shovel Knight has learned a lot during <i>Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove</i> and he brings those skills with him to Rivals of Aether. Shovel Knight swings, digs and shovel drops his way through the Rivals roster. He does it all while collecting treasure which he can use to purchase upgrades to give him the upper hand on the battlefield.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>TREASURE HUNTER – Shovel Knight’s attacks knock coins and gems out of his opponents. He can collect these to increase his treasure. By taunting, he summons Chester and can use his treasure to purchase either Relics or Armors to improve his fighting ability.<br></li><li>SHOVEL DROP – Shovel Knight’s signature ability is his Down Air in Rivals of Aether. With this attack he can strike his opponents from above and bounce off their heads. Hold the attack button to keep the Shovel beneath him. He can also bounce off objects and projectiles!<br></li><li>EXPERT FISHERMAN – Shovel Knight’s down special is the Fishing Rod. Use it off the side of the stage to fish up some treasure. Time it correctly and fish up a Treasure Rock, but time it perfectly and get a Golden Fish. </li></ul>",
