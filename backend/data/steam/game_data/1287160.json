For years now, each winter seems to grow longer, and Lore-Masters have taken to calling this winter, “The Endless Winter”. Albeit now the spring month of March, the ice-clad air is harsher and more bitter than any December in recent memory. Vital trade routes to the realms of the Elves, Dwarves, and Men are blocked by deep snow and crushing. Supplies are running low. Even the fine ale of the Scots, a source of solace in these dark times, has been exhausted. The Halflings are in need of a savior, a hero who can brave the frozen Old Forest and bring back the provisions they need to survive. Will you rise to the challenge, or let the Endless Winter claim another victim?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1287160/extras/55790cf565ac21c29d7477218fdd91e1.poster.avif?t=1759362736\" width=600 height=130 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1287160/extras/55790cf565ac21c29d7477218fdd91e1.webm?t=1759362736\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1287160/extras/55790cf565ac21c29d7477218fdd91e1.mp4?t=1759362736\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>As you journey through the realms, you will discover a wealth of resources to collect for crafting.

However, when they find themselves in a situation where their back is against a wall, they have a stout heart and can be fierce brave fighters. They are known for their quick reflexes and agility, and often use stealth and finesse rather than brute force in combat. When forced to engage in melee, halflings may wield a variety of weapons, including short swords, spears, and bows. As you journey through the world, you'll have the opportunity to find or craft a wide range of melee and ranged weapons to suit your play style.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1287160/extras/1b3b866cf22c347b7f315f25970d2caf.poster.avif?t=1759362736\" width=600 height=130 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1287160/extras/1b3b866cf22c347b7f315f25970d2caf.webm?t=1759362736\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1287160/extras/1b3b866cf22c347b7f315f25970d2caf.mp4?t=1759362736\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>Magic is a deeply revered art among the elves, but a few select and very wise Lore-Masters of Hauflinheim have also dedicated themselves to its study. If you seek to learn the arcane arts, you may find a tutor among these wise individuals, or you may travel to the land of the elves in Álfheimr to study directly with the masters. With time and practice, you may even discover ways to create new, powerful magics from the ancient lore that you have learned.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1287160/extras/d7162ae0618aecac9b039ba71b1e84a1.poster.avif?t=1759362736\" width=600 height=130 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1287160/extras/d7162ae0618aecac9b039ba71b1e84a1.webm?t=1759362736\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1287160/extras/d7162ae0618aecac9b039ba71b1e84a1.mp4?t=1759362736\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>Halflings are naturally stealthy creatures, thanks to their small size, quiet footsteps, and soft-spoken nature. They are often able to sneak past enemies undetected, even when they are right under their noses. Halflings often rely on stealth to avoid confrontation, but when necessary, they can hold their own in combat thanks to their quick reflexes and agility.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1287160/extras/158639e9cbe535b3b56d8a206cb4d8a3.poster.avif?t=1759362736\" width=600 height=130 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1287160/extras/158639e9cbe535b3b56d8a206cb4d8a3.webm?t=1759362736\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1287160/extras/158639e9cbe535b3b56d8a206cb4d8a3.mp4?t=1759362736\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>As you journey through the world, the paths you take will have far-reaching consequences, not only for the halflings, but for all the races of the realms - men, elves, dwarves, and more. It is up to you to find a way to bring an end to “The Endless Winter” and restore peace to the troubled spirit of the Old Forest.
