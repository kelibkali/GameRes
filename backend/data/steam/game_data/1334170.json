    "description": "<strong>Granduck</strong> is an arcade game about a grandfather who got lost in his apartment. Throw the ducks! Ducks quack when they fall into furniture, walls, or hit the floor. Grandad goes where the quacking has been heard. However, don’t forget that the grandpa doesn’t see where he is going, and his house resembles an armory. Your task is to bring him carefully to bed.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>50 levels. Every 10th is a special one<br></li><li>Controls are so simple that even a baby will master it.<br></li><li>Use your brainpower to give the grandfather a chance to sleep, not a heart attack!<br></li><li>Use your savvy to spend as little ducks as possible as the squad is limited.<br></li><li>The old man’s arsenal is no worse than Rambo’s: mines, lasers, turrets, and even atomic bombs.<br></li><li>Grumbling grandfather doesn’t affect the gameplay but motivates you.</li></ul>",
