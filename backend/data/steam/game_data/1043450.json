    "description": "You are a ball called Yang. Your girlfriend, Yin, has been kidnapped by the forces of chaos! You must save her.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYinyang is a simple arcade game of rolling a ball. Roll off a tile and it will flip over and vanish. Make them all vanish and the exit will open, so the trick is to roll along every tile without doubling back. There are special tiles that need two or three rolls, slippery tiles, rough tiles, fans, tiles that make your ball jump and bounce, and more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn easy game for all ages, you can use a controller or the arrow keys to move the ball. Every few levels there is a bonus round for extra lives, and every level you unlock gives you some bonus 'magic points' that will unlock extra game types in the special magic menu.",
