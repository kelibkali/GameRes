When the dust had settled, The Artifact took hostile action, hacking satellites, government databases, Military intranets, everything that it could access. Governments around the World came together, agreeing to co-operate in joint efforts to neutralize the common threat. The United Fleet of NATO, Russia, and China established a no-fly zone around the crash perimeter and world-leading scientists established secret research centers in mobile military bases.<br><br>After Intensive research on a mysterious forcefield shrouding the crash site, it became clear that a number of weak points would appear seemingly at random on its surface. All probes the we sent would disappear instantly once across the perimeter, without transmitting any information back. The first expedition of marines and scientists vanished without a trace. Misinformation and secrecy surrounding The Artifact eventually devolved into mass riots, panic, famine, unprecedented economic crisis and suicides rates, and as tension grew, it was decided that we make a preemptive strike using Tsar Bombs. After what seemed to be the first successful attack, The Artifact suddenly emitted a powerful blast, shifting the World back in time. And just like that, humanity simply “forgot” that the incident ever even happened.<br><br>Only days before the catastrophic <strong>Time-Shift</strong> brought on by The Artifact, an experimental new technology, a <strong>temporal implant</strong>, was implanted in a few hundred human volunteers. They are the few remaining that remember what actually happened. And so The <strong>Earth Defense Alliance (EDA)</strong> was formed, a shadow government controlled by The Artifact to gain influence across the world under the guise of preparing humanity for alien threats in the near future. As the EDA's influence increased, a faction within the EDA called <strong>Sons of Cain (SoC)</strong> openly opposed the organization, declaring war, labelling the EDA “alien puppets” who are driving humanity to its extinction. The EDA retaliate, ousting the SoC to the world as a terrorist organization, and so SoC members were hunted and exterminated on sight. Now, 35 years after the Time-Shift event, The Artifact abruptly cuts all commutations channels and its primary protocol is activated. The EDA quickly send a new recon team to investigate. Joining them, a talented Quantum Engineer, <strong>James Danziger</strong>, who has just arrived back on Earth from the EDA's Intensive Training Facilities on the Moon.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625630/extras/211f1f3bfb8a30b8c36e33039bbb0443.poster.avif?t=1764076011\" width=520 height=218 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625630/extras/211f1f3bfb8a30b8c36e33039bbb0443.webm?t=1764076011\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625630/extras/211f1f3bfb8a30b8c36e33039bbb0443.mp4?t=1764076011\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >We are planning to add in future:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Intriguing and original story with many layers to explore<br></li><li>Multiple factions with their own values and goals, YOU decide who will become friend or foe.<br></li><li>Many new and Innovative interaction mechanics<br></li><li>Upgradeable robot-dog companion<br></li><li>Multiple solutions to  different problems<br></li><li>Free roam, scavenging across open territories<br></li><li>Real-time dynamic AI for wild animals and wild life population<br></li><li>Hunting<br></li><li>Fishing<br></li><li>Treasure hunting, stashes, dig/hide minigame (and metal detecting)<br></li><li>Trading minigames (different vendors need different approaches)<br></li><li>Designing and setting traps<br></li><li>Further mod support<br></li><li>Additional Acrade games (disks may contain different games with hidden messages)<br></li><li>Additional cooking options<br></li><li>More weapon customization<br></li><li>High quality and adaptive AI<br></li><li>Other healing options<br></li><li>Safehouse upgrades and customization<br></li><li>Global worldwide seasonal events </li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625630/extras/a4e422e0f40d19d1457810173d796539.poster.avif?t=1764076011\" width=520 height=218 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625630/extras/a4e422e0f40d19d1457810173d796539.webm?t=1764076011\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625630/extras/a4e422e0f40d19d1457810173d796539.mp4?t=1764076011\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
