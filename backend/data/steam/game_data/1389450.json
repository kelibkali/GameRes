He learns that he has died and returned to the realm as a spirit. The only way he can find his way back to the living is to find the Rift Keeper. He soon learns that the world is being overrun by creatures and demons entering through the Rift. The people of the realm need him, but so does his family.<br><br>One thing that I tried to focus on was to have NPC characters explain or tell little bits of the story. So, even though it is not necessary always for completing a level, the players might find it useful and hopefully interesting to chat to the NPC characters!<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1389450/extras/4acbcea4d1614e11f7ab10f8cb88c288.avif?t=1665639629\" width=118 height=118 /></span> <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1389450/extras/aa57a507918e41e083deeb1fc7c8f461.avif?t=1665639629\" width=118 height=118 /></span> <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1389450/extras/863dfd66547664b547456b8f36c2cbd0.avif?t=1665639629\" width=118 height=118 /></span><br>Some NPC characters will be able to join you and help you fight your way through hoards of enemies.

The goal when creating this game was to try and build something solid for players to enjoy, and stay away from things that where too big or technical this time round. I want to learn as much as I can in all areas of game development. The funds and knowledge received from this game, will be used mostly to fund the next project and attempt something much more technical. I hope all of you find some value in this game. I love this game. Thank you for supporting DFG.",
