    "description": "<i>A strange phenomenon has swept across the globe. People began to fall asleep no matter where they are. By the third day only a remaining few who are still awake, surpressing their urge to sleep with, well... coffee. The rest shows no sign of waking up. </i> <br><br>Coffee crawl is a mix of action RPG, survival, and roguelike; that means permanent death. You play as one of the survivor who must find the source of the phenomena and put a stop to it, since you have nothing else to do. There's a slight learning curve in this game. You can learn the basic from the tutorial, but most stuff and interactions need to be discovered by player themselves, by playing and dying.<br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2>  <ul class=\"bb_ul\">  <li>Explore randomly-generated levels; from an inconspicuously large basement to a spellbinding library. <br> </li><li>Simple and fast-paced combat. No aiming skill required. You just have to know when to engage or retreat. <br> </li><li>Build your character from a pool of 120+ abilities and customise your look. <br> </li><li>Unlock more stuff as you play. <br> </li><li>Tons of items. <br> </li><li>Encounter 100+ different types of enemy. <br> </li><li>Play by the rules, or go anarchy and do whatever you like. Just don't get caught. <br> </li><li>Money is scarce so manage you resources, mine for materials, craft items, trade, or just take a loan. <br> </li><li>Employ the service of various NPCs scattered around the map or beat them for their lunch money. <br> </li><li>Detailed diplomacy system; make friend or enemy with people you meet along the way. <br> </li><li>Learn a weird language.  </li></ul>",
