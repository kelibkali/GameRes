    "description": "It’s 2065, and humanoid androids are the hot new gadget! They’re eager to please and totally obedient - or at least, that’s the plan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou play D-0527, an interrogator-model android whose job it is to analyse and judge other androids: the disobedient, malfunctioning kind. You’ll learn their secrets, gain their trust, and make the call: should they be released, or destroyed? Does an android that’s run from its owner need to be “fixed”?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese decisions may sound difficult, but you were built to answer them - and you wouldn’t disappoint your creator?",
