    "description": "<strong>The Deeply Complex City Building and Management Game</strong><br>The most authentic city-building simulation experience ever. Building cities is great, but managing them is where the real fun begins. Build, grow, and manage a town of zero into a world-class city with up to a 10,000,000 population where each citizen is a fully simulated person with a job, an education, and a life. Take on the development and ongoing administrative tasks necessary to keep a modern-day metropolis running and flourishing. You'll need to be city-planner, engineer, and mayor if you hope to be successful. Metropolisim is the definitive city builder.<br><br><strong>The Definitive City Building Experience</strong><br>LEVEL OF DETAIL - Build cities up to 10,000,000 population where every citizen is a fully simulated character. Watch them go about their lives as they travel to work, get stuck in traffic, take the bus, enjoy leisure activities, and more.<br>ZONING - Designate areas within your city for residential, commercial, high-technology, and industrial growth. Then watch as construction begins.<br>BUILDING - Construct city buildings to deliver essential services to your residents. Ensure you have the appropriate coverage in every category to meet their needs if you want your city to continue to grow.<br>MANAGING - Oversee the budget of your city. Balance tax revenue against expenses like essential services, maintenance, and cultural attractions to keep the treasury full.<br>TRANSIT &amp; TRAFFIC -Plan your city layout by precisely laying out streets, avenues, highways, and mass transit options to make sure your citizens can reach their destination quickly and safely, otherwise get ready to hear their gripes.<br><br><strong>A Nod to Classic City Sims and Builders, Re-Imagined for Modern Day</strong><br>Construction, zoning, traffic, public transportation, managing your budget, population management, hiring &amp; firing city employees, providing essential services, placing and servicing cultural landmarks. All simulated in tremendous detail. I've taken the best parts of past city builders and improved on them to continue to push the genre forward while still paying homage to the classics that got us here.<br><br><strong>Future Updates, DLC Policy, and Mod support</strong><br>As someone who has been playing city builders for 20+ years this game is both a passion project and a tribute to the genre. My mission is to make a better, more challenging city builder. I want the player to lose track of time in this game and get engrossed in the experience. My commitment is to not stop once the game is shipped. There will continue to be updates including new features, new buildings, and more after the game is released. Players will be able to add new content including buildings, through robust mod support.",
