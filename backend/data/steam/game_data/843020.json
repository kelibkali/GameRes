    "description": "Ever wanted to design, build and manage a café on your very own home computer? Really? OK then... welcome to HIPSTER CAFÉ.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Make stupid food, serve it on a skateboard, and impress your friends by drawing in your coffee.<br />\r\n-Is that a utility object or décor? Customise your space to keep it at the cutting edge of design.  <br />\r\n-Fill your café with the latest greatest entertainments and distractions. You should probably put an axe throwing range in your café, that seems safe.<br />\r\n-Keep up to date on the latest trends on social media, send out a Toot with the right hashtags before the Hot Take timer goes out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUse your trust fund to buy up some old warehouse building in the run down part of town then market it to the nouveau riche in a cynical attempt to drive up property prices. Can you successfully navigate the shifting waters of pop culture in order to market your eatery to the hippest demographic?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDeveloped in the Loading Bar in the hipster centre of Dalston, London by a bunch of hairy people who work as 'freelancers in media', Hipster Café is a simulation game based on very real life experiences. In it, you must serve up a menu based on the latest trends, research more obscure coffees and entertain the Hipsters by building up a map of ridiculous furniture.",
