But fortunately, enemy pilots walk around the field and will enter ships that they get close to. You will then be able to destroy the ship or allow the ship to move away and make space for you to proceed through the stage.<br><br>・ 5 puzzle stages, each based on a unique concept.<br>・ Very short bullet lifespan results in thrilling action. The closer you are, the faster you can fire!<br>・ The creator of this game is a musician, who created the music, program, and graphics for this game.
