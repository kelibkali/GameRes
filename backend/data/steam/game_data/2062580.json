The innovative game of Death Damnation incorporates a community aspect through the Twitch official extension. An entire community can view their favorite streamer and participate in their experience. The most diabolical? The viewers can change the course of the game : they can help the streamer by providing them with weapons, items, or health boosts, or they can choose to spread terror and send monsters to end the player's life.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >“Live a dark, creepy and scary experience with your community”</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2062580/extras/1e362cb92dc40243c99dc013079066eb.avif?t=1724957042\" width=600 height=200 /></span><br><br>Death Damnation is an indie, survival-based horror video game.

In the spooky graveyard and the derelict residential area, strange aggressive creatures will stand in your way. As the game progresses, events will come to test your composure and will certainly increase your heart rate. <br><br>Even if surviving is your first mission, you must complete missions, such as killing a number of zombies, getting interactions from viewers, meeting several challenges… Helped by your community, you may have not visited the whole map ?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >“Get your community involved in a dynamic, addictive and evolving game”</h2><br>Regularly, the studio feeds the game with new missions.
