Now, for the first time, Eternium itself is in great danger. For the first time watchers, a secret oath was broken and for the first time ever, someone that is not a watcher knows about Eternium, knows how to get there and is one power-hungry, malicious, cruel witch.<br>Magic Realm: Online Is a co-op multiplayer objective defense game developed exclusively for VR.

It is an endless wave-based shooter that combines different game genres. Play on your own or online with up to 4 other people that can join anytime. The game scales based on the number of people playing which makes it easier to play the game the way it's meant to be played - in multiplayer. See how long you can hold out against the relentless invaders and compete for the top spot on the <strong>global leaderboard</strong> as waves get increasingly more difficult.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/864610/extras/999cf4b602051c065035bc520593526d.avif?t=1574771284\" width=600 height=120 /></span><br><br>Play as one of distinct characters with unique abilities:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Wizard</strong> - master of elemental forces. Sunglasses included because casting shiny spells is bad for your eyes.<br></li><li><strong>Gunslinger</strong> - dual wielding gunner. Has a hidden passion for exploding things which he doesn't hide very well.<br></li><li><strong>Archer</strong> - master of bow and arrow. Firearms are overrated.<br></li><li><strong>Tinker</strong> - The Unstoppable War Machine.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/864610/extras/e483146cefda36ad3a311e3658a1975e.avif?t=1574771284\" width=600 height=120 /></span><br><br>Every map represents one planet in Magic Realm Universe.

Others are visceral flyers that aren't interested in the objective as much they're interested in destroying you.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/864610/extras/e6d5eab4d701c7937757a5beafd272f2.avif?t=1574771284\" width=600 height=120 /></span><br><br>Use our session-based upgrade system with unique upgrades for every character as a tool to destroy even more foes. You can decide if you want to upgrade only one skill to the point of destroying all enemies with it, or play tactically combining more skills and upgrades. In every session, you are collecting experience which can be used to upgrade your hero's skills. Every hero has 4 unique spells you can choose from, and every spell has its own 4 perks for an upgrade.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/864610/extras/bbb975724a57adc258396df18c9a9b89.avif?t=1574771284\" width=600 height=120 /></span><br><br>In every session, besides experience points, the hero is gathering coins too. Coins are used in the in-game shop, where you can buy different items to enhance your gameplay.
