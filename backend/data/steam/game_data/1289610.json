    "description": "Everything has changed since the day it happened.<br />\r\nSometimes I wonder if I chose this life myself or if it was imposed on me. I spend my days feeling sorry for myself, wanting to move, wanting to find a way out of that impasse that is not over yet.<br />\r\nI have files and files about what happened and I can't change it. I continue to chase someone who seems to me invisible every time, without a trace.<br />\r\nYou can try to help me find a way, you can try to help me move on and discover the whole truth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCan you?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTraumatic Syndrome is an investigation game with many elements of psychological terror with different endings and incredible discoveries. The game is built in an atmosphere of terror where the player is faced with the most terrible situations that a human being can face.",
