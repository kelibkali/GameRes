Grab your friends, jump down to the surface, and fight back enough machines to make rent this month.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A Dungeon Crawler Dressed as a Card Game</h2>Take on the role of misfit mercenaries and explore decks packed with 'bots, gear, and a ton of scrap. Your unlocked cards are the tools you'll use to make your way to the boss. Unlock and upgrade power ability cards, blueprint cards to craft in a pinch, and augment cards to boost your stats.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A World Worth Salvaging</h2>Humanity has fled to cityships just above the planet's surface, but we still need fuel, food, and valueless family heirlooms. That's where you come in. One good shove off the side of the ship and you've already started your mission. Don't worry, I'm sure another ship will come by to pick you up. Eventually.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A Fully Cooperative Experience</h2>Team up in groups of 1-4 in fully online co-op, and choose your loadout smartly to ensure maximum combo potential. Matchmaking and custom games are both available!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Alpha Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A cast of unique characters each with their own abilities, gear, and emotional baggage <br></li><li>100+ cards to unlock, including that one rare card that's pretty build defining<br></li><li>Adventure Mode - we bring the deck, you bring the monsters. The harder you make the game, the more rewards. If you win, of course. <br></li><li>A leveling system complicated enough for the most die-hard min-maxers </li></ul>",
