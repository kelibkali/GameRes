    "description": "They say that Tichu is a game of which &quot;rules cannot be explained&quot;. It is a team-based game that is a mix between Poker (Various card sequences) and Bridge (2vs2). The goal is simple, to gain as many points as it's feasible which is done by getting rid of the cards from your hand as soon as possible. Seems simple right? It actually isn't because in this game you can never think that victory is yours. Tichu is a <strong><u>game in which neither two strifes are the same</u></strong>. Think of your own tactic, figure your opponent's tactic, gain 1000 points as first - win the game.<br>Play with bots to polish your form, and then get a group of friends and show them who's boss. In tichu only <strong><u>4 players are admissible, 2 vs 2, partners sit in front of each other</u></strong>. <br><br>Game features occuring from rules: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> cards:<br>* normal: 4 colours from 2 to ace;<br>* special: dragon (which can beat any other single card), phoenix (Joker), dog (Giving your move to the partner) and a one (Designates the starting player);<br>* bombs that can beat any sequence of cards at any time;<br></li><li> specific scoring; only some of the cards are scored, phoenix is scored negatively (-25), dragon is scored positively (+25), bonus for team win;<br></li><li> declaring TICHU - bets that the declarer will win</li></ul><br>Video game features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> each of the players may be a real person or a bot;<br></li><li> voicechat and chat are available;<br></li><li> every bot can be redesigned to play how you want him to;<br></li><li> tools suiting your need of learning various plays and tactics:<br>* open cards mode;<br>* predefined card deals;<br>* replay of the whole game with possibility to play with humans or bots from selected position and as selected side.</li></ul><br>Against the saying that you cannot explain the rules of Tichu, comes the built-in instruction of the game, which deeply and clearly explains all game rules and you also get a tactic guide! However, the best way to get a hold of the game is to play so get your copy and declare your first TICHU.",
