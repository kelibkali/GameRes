It is based on: <br><br>* Hi-fidelity modeling of continuous-time and space; <br>* Realistic command structure and process; <br>* Macro management; and <br>* Orders delay. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/521800/extras/9f418c9c072798942330590cb5c387d4.avif?t=1770078518\" width=616 height=140 /></span><br>For that, Command Ops 2 is different than any other simulation wargame: no hexes, no turns, no micromanagement, no click fests. That is why it is in a way simpler and more fun to play but at the same time more challenging, because it makes you command as Commanders do. <br><br>Command Ops sports some of the most advanced and impressive AI ever devised in an operational-level wargame. It is your choice whether to manage every detail of your army or have the friendly AI manage the war on a lower level while you plan the larger scale maneuvers designed to make short work of your enemy. Just as a historical commander, you can choose where you need to step in and when you need to stand back and let your subordinates do their jobs. <br><br>The enemy AI will use its skill to launch well-timed and coordinated strikes as it probes your lines for weakness while realistically reacting to your movements! In addition, for the enthusiastic mod community awaiting Command Ops, powerful tools like MapMaker and ScenMaker allow for the creation of maps and scenarios further adding to already near-limitless replayability. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/521800/extras/0b74232b355028144a1dce72f4c34bfb.avif?t=1770078518\" width=616 height=140 /></span><br>Command Ops 2 game application has a new user interface (UI) and enhanced artificial intelligence (AI). The smartest and most realistic operational level wargame just got a whole lot better. Command like a real commander in this pausable, continuous-time simulation of WW2 operational warfare, where the emphasis is on planning, anticipating and reacting to enemy developments. This is not a click-fest, and you don’t have to issue orders to every unit. The world’s smartest operational level AI can be trusted to do a reasonable job of managing your forces. Also included are the editors ( MapMaker, EstabMaker, EstabEditor, and ScenMaker ) for modifying or developing your own scenarios. The Core comes with three scenarios, including the tutorial Return to St Vith, Manhay Crossroads, and Greyhound Dash, all focussed on the Epic 1944 Battle of the Bulge. <br><br><br>* Realistic command decision-making at the operational level <br>* Assess, plan, order and react just like a real Corps, Division, and Brigade Commander <br>* No hexes, no turns, no micromanagement, no click fests <br>* One of the most advanced commercial AI opponents ever developed <br>* A contender for the best AI in any wargame <br>* The AI can manage subordinate commanders and handle micromanagement <br>* Automated bridge building <br>* Advanced force allocation algorithms to keep your army balanced and sharp <br>* Multiple force group structures to enable cross attachments and different ways of displaying the order of battle <br>* Reaction and reassessment code for smarter responses from both the enemy and friendly AI <br>* Scheduling code to better manage the sequencing of tasks <br>* Multiple route-finding algorithms so units can rush to battle but become exposed, avoid enemy firepower, <br>stick to covered terrain or take a safe but slow route <br>* Formation movement code, including phase lines <br>* Enhanced sighting code <br>* Enhanced basing code <br>* Intuitive powerful interface <br>* Configurable Interface layout.
