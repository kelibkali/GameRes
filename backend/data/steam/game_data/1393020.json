The scavengers in town must work together to disable the titan limb-by-limb and save the outpost from annihilation. They are aided throughout by the Oracle of War, which provides vital tactical advice alongside cryptic verses from the Draconic Prophecy. This Three-Hour Multitable Adventure is for Tier 1 characters and optimized for APL 4. Notes in the adventure allow for it to be used as a single-table event as well.<br>Welcome to the<br><i>  Oracle of War</i><br>campaign, a new 20-part standalone story for the D&amp;D Adventurers League!
