    "description": "After escaping from prison, the six Loaded's anti-heroes -- Loaded, Mamma, Bounca, Butch, Cap'n'hands, Sister Magpie and The Consumer -- take brutal revenge C.H.E.B., the betrayer who put them there. These maniacal killers will be slaying and destroying anything in the six levels forming their path, as C.H.E.B. meanwhile finds nothing better to do than evolve into a monstrous being hell-bent on universal domination!<br />\r\nIf you like your games violent, you’re in for a sick treat with Re-Loaded, the sequel to the popular blood-fest shooter Loaded. Re-Loaded is set over a number of 3D levels each more harrowing than the last. The sound effects will have you cringing, and the character animations show each minuscule trait of the six maniacs. Characters range from armed robots to bloodthirsty cannibal girls, and each is vicious enough to destroy anything in its path. Choose your lunatic and blast, slash, and bite your way to sweet freedom.",
