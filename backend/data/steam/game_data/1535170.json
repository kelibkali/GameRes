The game will allow you to run your own small roadside assistance business and climb to the top of your mobile mechanic career. You will take part in various support tasks on the road, with different levels of difficulty, and at any time of the day. It does not matter if it is just replacing a light bulb, a flat tire, or resetting an error from the computer. You have to deal with the problem on the spot! Well, unless it is impossible, then you will need a tug and a repair team.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1535170/extras/cb5b92bb3280aa478bdd5619feec555e.poster.avif?t=1649503308\" width=616 height=176 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1535170/extras/cb5b92bb3280aa478bdd5619feec555e.webm?t=1649503308\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1535170/extras/cb5b92bb3280aa478bdd5619feec555e.mp4?t=1649503308\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Playing the role of a roadside assistance worker, our challenge will be to repair cars in harsh road conditions.

It is the client who will judge whether he is satisfied with your services or if you end up on his blacklist.
