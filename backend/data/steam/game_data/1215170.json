    "description": "Dawnthorn is a topdown, pixel-art ARPG with a character and experience firmly rooted in the 8bit era. It features action-adventure style gameplay. Players will experience hectic, item-driven real-time combat, and solve puzzles and challenges spanning one single room, or the entire game-world! The experience features over 9 unique dungeons, and a sprawling overworld linking everything together, filled to the brim with rich characters, subquests, mini-games, and dozens of secrets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers take on the role of a headstrong young archetypal hero who, though from a prosperous time of bounty, has dedicated himself to righting a great wrong committed centuries ago. He comes armed only with fierce will and the promise of youth. Will these alone be enough? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers can expect a roughly 15-20 hour experience, with high replay value and bonus content!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDawnthorn is coming to Windows, Mac, and Linux Platforms on Steam, sometime in 2020!",
