You can play alone or as a team. The more polar friends you have with you, the easier it is. But there can be a strictly limited number of polar explorers at one polar station.<br><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Non-linearity, for solving each task you can go in different ways;<br></li><li> Nice graphics;<br></li><li> Sophisticated shooting mechanics;<br></li><li> Ability to overcome difficulties with a friend;[/]<br><br>The action takes place at the Khmuryi polar station.
