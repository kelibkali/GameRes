    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > Treasury of the Kingdom (5E)</h2>Over 40 fantastic magic items for 5E!<br><i> Treasury of the Kingdom</i> brings you a bevy of magical items perfect for the freeholder lords of a newborn kingdom hacked out of the wilderness. Here can be found tools of war like the<br><i> shield of the encroaching forest</i> and<br><i> battle standard of the fallen</i> , but also implements of exploration to blaze trails through forest and field, hill and vale like the<br><i> survivalist's arrow</i> and<br><i> scout's spyglass</i> . Finally, since explorers in the deep wild are not moving into lands uninhabited, but rather places that are haunted by the magical and mysterious fey and monstrous tribes alike, from the<br><i> burning skull mace</i> and<br><i> hag's eye</i> to the<br><i> staff of the fey queen!</i> In all, you'll find over 40 magic items, from single-use ephemera to a pair of mighty artifacts; everything you'll need to stock your wilderness kingdom campaign with an array of awesome items to intrigue your players and enrich their enemies. If it's fantastical items that delight and excite, your PCs will love what they find in the<br><i> Treasury of the Kingdom</i> .<br><i> Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by:</i><br><strong> Connor Bates</strong><br><strong> Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and any ruleset. Compatible with Fantasy Grounds Unity<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
