The train platform, emptied of all other people, becomes a private performance space for a real-life busking musician. Multi-axis freedom of movement, combined with spatialized audio, creates a uniquely immersive and transporting experience for the viewer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease note: no manual input after launch (including keyboard/mouse).
