The Lorebook, or &quot;Tabitha's Book of Everything&quot; as it's known in-universe, is a companion book that will grow as the game world grows. Inside you will find wiki-like summaries of places and characters, some personal insights from the creator, as well as some bonus content to go with each episode, usually a small memoir, essay or rant, and a short choose-your-own-adventure style mini text-adventure.",
