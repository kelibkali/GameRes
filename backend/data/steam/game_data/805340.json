    "description": "Cubiques 2 is the sequel of our acclaimed indie game &quot;Cubiques&quot;. In this new sequel multiple cubes invade this simplistic but very challenging world. Every movement must be well thought out since each movement can affect multiple cubes in the environment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Sometimes things don't have to be complicated to be a good puzzler, and Cubiques looks like it might use the right side of minimalism.&quot;<br />\r\nPocket Gamer<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;If you enjoy minimalist puzzle games on your phone, you'll probably enjoy Cubiques. The art style goes for a Monument Valley kind of aesthetic.&quot;<br />\r\nTouch Arcade<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;A minimalistic puzzle platformer reminiscent of Edge.&quot;<br />\r\nAppAdvice<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* 70 unique and beautiful puzzle levels.<br />\r\n* Beautiful black and white 3D isometric design.<br />\r\n* Beautiful graphic design.<br />\r\n* Simple keyboard arrow controls (WASD or arrow keys for movement).<br />\r\n* Ability to scroll through already played levels providing you a way to track your best score.<br />\r\n* Localized in English, Spanish, French, German, Romanian, and Italian.<br />\r\n* Unique and relaxing music.<br />\r\n* Menu fluid animations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for playing and supporting an indie game developer.<br />\r\nDilmer Valecillos",
