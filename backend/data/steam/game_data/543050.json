Discover a rich universe with ancient history that has been violently occupied by the vicious alien Kasaar race. You take on the role of Hadrian, a regular Taraanian, who is trying to get by until a mysterious time traveler sets in motion a series of events that will change his life, and the planet's future forever.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/543050/extras/3ade18ce7033732ffa01f2385231b5ef.avif?t=1528137526\" width=616 height=346 /></span><br><br>Long before recorded Taraan history, the people of Taraan lived in the ignorance of the planet’s power. However, one amongst them discovered the uniqueness of the planet: a raw and powerful energy that could tame the chaos of time. From this discovery, the ARC was created, a device capable of controlling the rhythm of life itself. With this power, a civilization flourished for centuries and disappeared without reason. Modern day Taraanians know little of this history but stories have been preserved in myths and legends, unaware that their cities are built on the very location where their past once flourished.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/543050/extras/7ffaecc94a187abd023e1fbed41168ca.avif?t=1528137526\" width=616 height=346 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/543050/extras/d20f0921638000b999293bbdc3d861e7.avif?t=1528137526\" width=629 height=101 /></span><br><br>The ARC is a device of near godlike power, with the ARC you gain control over time itself, granting you fantastical powers to slow, rewind or manipulate the flow of time.

They seek the power of the ARC and have deployed some of their deadliest troops to acquire it at all costs.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/543050/extras/7b99dd877e3b5af39823b6aa5ac06206.avif?t=1528137526\" width=616 height=346 /></span><br><br>In ARC Continuum, parts of the Taraanian world are in time flux. These localized disturbances are the results of the experimentation in time technology. With the disruption in time, you have the opportunity to jump to alternate timelines where you can request help from other versions of yourself and complete cooperative multiplayer time objectives.",
