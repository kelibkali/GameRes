    "description": "'The Annoying Game' is a retro style platformer where everything is made to annoy you: the traps, levels, music, sound effects, dying. Are you patient enough to deal with all of that? <br><br>With only three keys (arrows or WAD) to control the character, the game is easy to learn, but extremely difficult to master. Dive into hours of dying in many different ways in set of dungeons made to make you angry. And better prepare some replacement keyboard(s).<br><br><strong>Key features:<br>Easy controls: </strong>with only three keys (arrows or WAD) you can learn how to play in just few seconds, and get annoyed sooner.<br><strong>Dozens of traps: </strong>because why die in only one way?<br><strong>Dozens of levels: </strong>because one might not be enough to make you totally annoyed.<br><strong>Original music: </strong>which will become more and more annoying with time.<br><strong>Rushed hand-drawn graphics: </strong>because drawing slowly and carefully can make graphics and animations look too good to be annoying.<br><strong>Wilhelm scream: </strong>the most popular and annoying sound effect in the world.",
