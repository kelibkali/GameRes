And, being Eric, you realise that you must at all costs remove your report before it comes to the attention of the Headmaster.<br><br>The combination to the safe consists of four letters, each master knowing one letter and the Headmaster's letter always coming first. To get hold of the combination, you first have to hit all the shields hanging on the school walls. Trouble is, this isn't as easy as it looks. Some of them can be hit by jumping up. Others are more difficult. You could try and hit a shield by bouncing a pellet off a master's head whilst he is sitting on the ground. Or, being Eric, you may decide to knock over one of the boys and, whilst he's flattened, clamber up on him so that you can jump higher.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/524430/extras/6e4c09eda48e91dda1af08a111fdae04.poster.avif?t=1571647722\" width=616 height=218 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/524430/extras/6e4c09eda48e91dda1af08a111fdae04.webm?t=1571647722\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/524430/extras/6e4c09eda48e91dda1af08a111fdae04.mp4?t=1571647722\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/524430/extras/db2b4ac986b0735ac460395b5346f725.webp?t=1571647722\" width=228 height=41 /></span><br><br>Having managed to steal your report during the last few skooldaze of term, you've spent the whole holiday forging teachers' signatures and handwriting to make yourself look like the brightest, sweetest natured, most helpful little soul ever to carry a satchel.<br><br>Now all you've got to do is get it back into the Head's safe…<br><br>A couple of years ago, your elder brother had exactly the same problem and has lent you his old copy of the School Rules, on which he's scribbled some notes in invisible ink.
