Corrupt in both physique and soul, bearing the corrupted bloodline of the Abyss, Vlexigorn enjoys nothing more than binding his own foul cousins to his will, in order to advance his own foul ambitions, and then destroying them once their use is at an end.<br>Their mission is to wait for the sounds of the Last Song boarding another ship at sea, and then to exit their hideaway to investigate. If they discover the crew committing an act of piracy, they are to present their documentation, arrest Elloise, and commandeer the ship.<br>Pit your Wits<br>Mini-Dungeon for 4-6 characters levels 1-2<br>The characters' arrival at a small, well-established mining site, after a request to clear some &quot;mutated goblins&quot;, reveals an unexpected, disturbing sight. The mine's main premises, a 40-ft. square stone building positioned over a 10-ft.-by-10-ft. shaft, is gone, save for dozens of pieces of rubble, a 30-ft. wide hole, and inky-black depths.<br>Doubt Not That Stars Are Fire<br>Mini-Dungeon for 4-6 characters levels 2-3<br>Following mutated goblin attacks on a small, well-established mining site, the PCs find that only the pit remains. On securing the surrounding area, they must enter the steep-sided crater. They find the walls glowing with other-worldly energy, alight with &quot;coldfire&quot;.<br>When Goblins Die, No Comets Are Seen<br>4-6 PCs of levels 3-4<br>After delving into the upper tunnels of a recently abandoned mine pursuing mutated goblins, the party follows some buckled minecart rails, finding rough tunnels and unexpected chambers at their end. A palpable sense of fear pervades the area.<br>The last members of a decimated tribe fled into these depths but have no idea what to do now. They reached Area 5 but felt the sudden appearance of a worked room meant more trouble. Infamous amongst their kind, and fearing an unheralded death, they're currently psyching themselves to fight back to the surface.<br>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by:<br><strong> Anthony Rush</strong><br><strong> Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included 5E Compatible ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
