Your way of transport is AsmiCorp’s finest mining rig, <strong>the Series 61 train</strong>. A fully customizable, fast and enduring machine with capabilities to <u>house crew</u>, <u>refine the minerals</u> you mine and <u>get you across Vidora’s landscape</u> efficiently.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Your Crew</h2>Starting out you have to preform most tasks yourself and on your own, this will not last long as you grow your crew. Crew members can be recruited to your train from crew vendors and be assigned specific roles such as <strong>Miners, Hunters, Armsman and others</strong>. You strategically place and command your crew to increase efficiency and survivability.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Your Train</h2>With the modular design of AsmiCorp’s Series 61 mining rig, you are in control of the carts that it has, the equipment on board, increasing your housing space to house the crew you hire and ensuring that there is enough power to run everything. Keep in mind rookie, to build extra carts and onboard equipment you desire will require you to have the sufficient funds, materials and reputation to do so.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Expeditions</h2>Each expedition outside the safety of your mining rig, requires <strong>planning and strategizing</strong>. This will not only ensure you deliver what you <strong>gather, mine and harvest</strong> back to your rig successfully but also increase the chances of <strong>you and your crew</strong> making it back safely, as Vidora and her creatures are known to punish unexperienced miners and their mistakes.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1628820/extras/dbbd9ed202076b05954a6f51aa1efd83.poster.avif?t=1668058044\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1628820/extras/dbbd9ed202076b05954a6f51aa1efd83.webm?t=1668058044\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1628820/extras/dbbd9ed202076b05954a6f51aa1efd83.mp4?t=1668058044\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Majority of Vidora’s creatures rely highly on their sense of hearing. Making any sudden noises in her wilderness will definitely anger the creatures that surround you thus making preforming loud tasks like mining and shooting weapons very dangerous and require the suitable equipment, fire power and planning to complete your expeditions and return safely.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Mining</h2>As an AsmiCorp miner, your main goal is to mine the minerals above and beneath Vidora’s surface. Along your expeditions, you will come across many valuable and interesting minerals, the most important being Asmegite. In order to extract these minerals, you will be required to use the many unique tools and equipment that AsmiCorp has provided you with or you have crafted. But be warned, harvesting Vidora’s precious minerals angers her and her creatures, so mining expeditions will not be easy or safe.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Construct your train (base), build carts, upgrade interior etc.<br></li><li> Explore a 34 square km open world on your train, on foot and other vehicles.<br></li><li> Hire crew with specific attributes, assign roles and lead your team.<br></li><li> Mine deep into the world with the help of explosives and powered mining tools.<br></li><li> Clear out Safe Zones to unlock new carts and upgrades.<br></li><li> Strategically balance your train's oxygen, food supply, fuel, crew and more.</li></ul>",
