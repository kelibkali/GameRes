    "description": "Part of these tools are now available as a Unreal Engine plugin, check out Plan V Tools on the marketplace (Link).<br><br>From hobbyists to production professionals, Plan V is a virtual visualisation software. Plan V gives the user a sense of scale and immersion previously unattainable with traditional pre-visualisation tools. The software has been developed for Windows desktop platforms, with a Mac application coming soon.   <br><br>Plan V improves the design process between script writing and set building. It allows users to jump in, iterate and see results immediately. This in turn reduces costs whilst increasing production efficiency.<br><br>Plan V comes packed with a wide range of functions and settings, allowing users to experiment in real time with different lenses, cameras, animations, lighting and many other options without extensive knowledge of 3D modelling software.<br><br>This process was conceived on Black Mirror (Netflix) and has successfully proven itself during the production of His Dark Materials (BBC/HBO).<br><br>Powered by Unreal Engine ®.",
