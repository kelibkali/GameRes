It’s inspired by old-school <i>Minecraft </i>modpacks and features many new and unique features such as character creation, building templates and monster-filled castles.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Hi everyone! My name is Sergio, and Elsewhere is a game I’ve been developing since 2012. Since late 2018, I’ve been working on it nearly full-time.
