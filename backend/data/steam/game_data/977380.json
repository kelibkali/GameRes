    "description": "A legendary Space Opera? Perhaps. A silly oldschool RPG with dice instead of combat? Definitely.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCaptain Spice and his small band of misfits must embark on a thrilling adventure with their space ship, the Cool Ship, while they try to stop an evil Space Wizard from destroying the galaxy. This game has it all: A duck, dice, NPCs, a guy named Slappy, a very long discussion with a flautist, Simon freaking Tower as an evil villian. What more could you ask for?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpice Pirates in Space: a Retro RPG does not take itself too seriously. It's a fun story that usually can get a few laughs. I made it myself and it is not a AAA game. It costs less than a beer and hopefully you enjoy it almost as much!",
