    "description": "King's Cup is a drinking game played online with friends. A player pulls a card from the card circle and places it on top of the cup in the center face side up. Based on the card that player or all players must take an action, usually leading to one or more people taking a drink.   It is recommended to have 3 or more players before starting the game and to use a VoIP chatting service like Discord.<br><br><strong>Controls:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Thumbs up: Right Click or Space<br></li><li> Heaven: W or Up-arrow<br></li><li> Date: Left click the heart next to another player's name<br></li><li> Drag a card: Left click and hold, move your mouse to move the card.

This is up to the players in the game.<br></li><li> 9 - Rhyme, the person who pulled the card says a word.  Going in order, everyone must rhyme with this word.

Duplicate words are not allowed. <br></li><li> 10 - Categories, person who pulled the card says a category (e.g. car manufacturers).  Everyone must name something in this category (e.g. Ford, Chevy), starting with the person who pulled the card and going in order according to the player list.  This continues until someone cannot name something in the category (no duplicates).  That person drinks and the game resumes.<br></li><li> J - Rule, the person who pulled the card creates a new rule everyone must follow.  For example, &quot;everyone must speak in a German accent&quot;.  Some players allow multiple rules, some only keep one rule at a time.  This is up to the players.<br></li><li> Q - Questionmaster, anyone who answers (or responds to) a question asked by the Questionmaster must drink.  The Questionmaster should try to trick players by occasionally asking questions like &quot;Whose turn is it?&quot;.  Only one Questionmaster exists at a time.<br></li><li> K - King, when the 1st, 2nd and 3rd King is pulled that person takes a drink.  When the 4th and final King is pulled, that person is crowned King and must take a ceremonial shot.  The game typically ends here, but if you want to keep going until no cards remain you can.</li></ul>",
