    "description": "( Turn ON or OFF this DLC in game OPTIONS )<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you are a business and tycoon games lover you may want to pay additional attention to this DLC. This DLC provides a new great experience to the game – construction of Cooperative Industrialization Project (CIP). CIP can be constructed between two countries. The first (host) country must be part of your alliance and another (partner) country can be either part of your alliance or neutral. You can’t construct CIP with an alliance of your foe or between two neutral countries. One country can participate in one CIP only. You can’t build multiply CIPs in the same country. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCIP provides two major bonuses. The first bonus adds score points by one for each country in the project. And the second bonus is extra free production for your government pool yearly – military, spy or diplomats ( can be chosen upon construction and can’t be changed later in the game ). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt takes two years to construct CIP. The cost of construction is the sum of two scores per turn/month. For example, if you want to build CIP between the UK and Ireland it will be 4+1=5$ per turn/month during 24 turns/months ( 120$ in total ). Think twice before you launch construction because CIP can be costly for the balance of your budget and you can’t stop it once it has started!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf any party in CIP joins your foe alliance CIP dismantles automatically ( therefore extra production ) but the score value stays. Crisis of the Elites event does not affect CIP production.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAI also builds CIP when it thinks it needs to. The decision of what production it should be depends on the current leader. For example Stalin, Truman, Khrushev and Kennedy prefer to build military production. Other leaders mostly prefer diplomats and spies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt cost one political point to start construction. Economic suit for leaders provide 20% discount for CIP construction.",
