    "description": "The earth is under a threat of destruction, and the survival of humanity depends on whether one of the Soviet ships, 'Rodina', can find a new home among the stars. Piloted vehicles - volots - were once used for the peaceful purposes, but now is the time to forge plowshares into swords. You have to lead a detachment of volots, and with their help make forays into completely new unexplored territories. But can technologies, created to bring peace, be a worthy contender in the war of the cosmic races?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1539240/extras/94bc89c0361137bb42a2bf131aea17f2.avif?t=1704954671\" width=600 height=94 /></span><br>Build a combat vehicle that suits your chosen mission best.
