    "description": "(NOT A MOBILE GAME PORT or NOT AN RPG MAKER GAME!!!) <br>You are in the nature and surrounded by different creatures. Every creature tries to survive just like you. You have nothing more than others but one. You have an anomaly. Your anomaly is the ability to talk with the spirit of the nature. The spirit of the nature is trying to get rid of anomalies and create a balanced nature. It decides to utilize you for defeating other anomalies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>About Gameplay</strong>:</h2>Your character has 4 attributes. These are strength, vitality, agility and intelligence. This time you are not going to choose which one will increase, directly. These attributes will increase according to what you do. For example; agility will increase as you walk or as you dodge from a projectile.<br><br>There are weapons that you can equip. You will earn new skills with weapons.<br><br>There are 3 different status which are “Slow”, “Immobilized” and “Poisoned”.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Craft</strong></h2>You have a dream.

Once you have committed to your partner, there is no way back.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Party System</strong></h2>If you beat a living it may choose to obey you, when they do that you can accept or decline their obedience.
