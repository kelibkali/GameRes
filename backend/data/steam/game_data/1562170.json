It's been months since you last saw Theo, and she's incredibly excited to spend the weekend together. <br><br>She invites her roommate Lena to join the group, and Theo extends an invitation to your friend Alec. After parting ways to attend different colleges, it's just the get-together that you need to reconnect. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1562170/extras/55ed3b86eb85b4e3d1e88a9eff784055.avif?t=1614272533\" width=720 height=404 /></span><br><br>Everything seems to be coming together perfectly... until Alec insists on driving by himself. You arrive at the cottage before him, certain that he's ditched the group. A short while later, he calls to announce that he's bringing along an uninvited guest.<br><br>Although Erika may be from the same small-town as most of the group, that's about the only thing you share in common... <br><br>Will you enjoy your night with Theo and wish on a star?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>The Cast:</strong></h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1562170/extras/a198009bd719a699c03a74e57cd5aeaa.avif?t=1614272533\" width=546 height=404 /></span><br><br>Theo is your childhood friend. Although initially shy with strangers, Theo has a great sense of humour and loves to joke around with her friends. She prefers to have a tight-knit group and doesn’t open up to just anyone. She studies photography at the same college as her roommate Lena and loves spending time with her. Theo won a draw for a cottage getaway in the town of Seaside and is your host for the weekend.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1562170/extras/986181723639a2ad8a8ce4060d6dfaa2.avif?t=1614272533\" width=570 height=404 /></span><br><br><br>Lena is Theo’s roommate… and replacement best friend. You don’t know much about her, or even what she’s studying. From what you’ve seen on Friendex, Lena is a vibrant and outgoing person. She’s always dyeing her hair different colours and wearing cute clothes. According to her online bio, in her spare time she enjoys hiking and playing piano.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1562170/extras/65e2379ba2ed91cd3d041dc97a9b5da3.avif?t=1614272533\" width=546 height=404 /></span><br><br><br>Alec is a friend from your hometown who is attending the same college. You both have similar hobbies like gaming, eating out, and playing soccer. Naturally, renting a student house with Alec seemed like a great idea… until he started dating. He jumps from girl to girl, never committing despite constantly whining that he wants a serious relationship. His latest date, Erika, tagged along to the cottage without an invitation. Lately, Alec has been annoying you... more than usual.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1562170/extras/8bb9235f9adf72276b8e3755de7313a1.avif?t=1614272533\" width=536 height=404 /></span><br><br><br>A year younger than you, Erika is from the same hometown.
