    "description": "Download the free demo today and enjoy a sample of midsummer in the heart of Finland! Explore the beautiful lakeside cabin and its surroundings as you search for your friend, as yet unaware of her disappearance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this short demo you'll be able to get a feel for the pace of the gameplay and some of the key narrative features that I developed for the game, like taking photos and posting to social media (in-game, not real life!). For the purposes of the demo most of the areas outside the cabin will be locked. You'll be able to continue the story when the full game is released on the 30th of October!",
