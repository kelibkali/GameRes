Dimensional portals now scar the landscape, bleeding endless waves of monstrous entities into a world on the brink of total collapse. As one of the last defenders standing, you are the only barrier between survival and extinction. Your mission is simple but suicide: contain the invasion, face the escalating horrors, and hold the line against the darkness. With every wave, the threat grows stronger and the portals yield more terrifying secrets. How many rounds can you endure before the void finally claims what remains?</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About Elements Studio</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Mauled</strong> is a passion project developed entirely by a <strong>solo developer</strong> dedicated to creating an evolving and visceral combat experience.
