    "description": "Use your harvester to deforest forests and save humanity! Wait... what?!??! <br><br>After the world has cut away too many forests, something happened... it appeared as if Earth fought back and started accelerating the growth of trees at exponential rates. Within a few years, thousands of cities became engulfed in trees and started eroding back humanity’s land. Humanity put monumental efforts into trying to keep the spread back, but it’s barely holding on.<br><br>Rumors spread that there were supernatural forces at work, fueling this exponential growth, but all efforts thus far to uncover the truth have failed...<br><br>In the last effort to save humanity, several outposts were deployed deep in the woods in an attempt to liberate the remaining cities and uncover something that would give hope back to humanity...  You are in charge of one of these outposts with your trusted harvester... Go now, chop chop!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2069060/extras/23e2143974918dba8a9d6063f3d1ffd9.poster.avif?t=1723699251\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2069060/extras/23e2143974918dba8a9d6063f3d1ffd9.webm?t=1723699251\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2069060/extras/23e2143974918dba8a9d6063f3d1ffd9.mp4?t=1723699251\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>The citizens of various cities have been radioed and made aware that you have the biggest and meanest harvester around, so they count on you to reconnect them with the rest of civilization!<br><br>So, you almost got the role of a hero, but will you justify it?<br><br>Chop your way into the forest, while returning as many logs as you can back to your base to sell for profits.
