Brian tried very hard to find some trace of his father's disappearance in his life, but without success until one day, an unknown man kidnapped Brian and imprisoned him in his father's cabin deep in the woods in a barely accessible terrain. Brian's father used this cabin as a secret workshop in which he worked on all those things that required high secrecy. Brian doesn`t remember how he was kidnapped because he was left unconscious during the kidnapping following a blunt blow to his head by an unknown person who approached him at night while walking in a city park. He also doesn't remember how he found himself in the cabin. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1165840/extras/c7fc05a44cd9b9f679cef60cacba3f3c.avif?t=1762194619\" width=600 height=336 /></span><br><br>He didn`t know that the cabin was owned by his father. He has never heard about that cabin before. He remembered that he read in one of the books his mother wrote about the secret cabin. The cabin from the book and the cabin where Brian is locked had a lot of similarities. He felt that he had been in the cabin before, but it felt like that was a very long time ago, in the past when he was a young boy so, he cannot recall the memories. Brian is locked in the cage in the basement of the cabin and the main goal of this chapter is to escape from the cabin using his creativeness, his mind, the tools that he`s supposed to find and his training by his father.",
