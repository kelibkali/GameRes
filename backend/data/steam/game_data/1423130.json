    "description": "The Demo for Trouble Hunter Chronicles: The Stolen Creed takes place five years before the main game. It offers a brief glance into the world of the main character while giving you a feel for the game style.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs Thomas wakes up in the middle of the day, ready for yet another afternoon spent in the bar, you must make sure he finishes the translation job he started yesterday.<br />\r\nWith his memory not being very helpful can you figure out where he put the file and where what is in his hotel room? Will you even manage to open the door and meet the hotel bellboy who, while probably not so annoying usually, really seems to grate on your nerves?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou won't be battling mysterious enemies or uncovering hidden secrets but you will need to open a drawer! As you can see, great challenges await in the demo!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay the short demo of Trouble Hunter Chronicles: The Stolen Creed to get hooked for the full game!",
