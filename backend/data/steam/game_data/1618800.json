You play as a physically simulated ooze that loots equipment and powers off its enemies. Select from a wide variety of weapons and passive equipment to fine-tune your build. Loot gold throughout your run to earn upgrades before venturing back into the tower to try and reach the top. Explore dank dungeons and discover hidden secrets, unlock new oozes to play as, and take your rightful place at the top of the tower!",
