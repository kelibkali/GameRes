However, please do note that like always, we cannot provide official support on the development or usage of Addons.<br><br><br><br>Note: RPG MAKER UNITE requires the usage of Unity Editor game engine.<br>To use Unity Editor, you must agree to the Terms of Service outlined by Unity Technologies:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >■What is “Maker series”?</h2>The Maker series are game development software that dates as far back to the 1990s. We released multiple engines fitting different developer needs such as RPGs, Visual Novels, Action Games, and so on. While the past Maker titles were standalone software, we believe that with Unity's capabilities and our 30 years of experience in making visually forward engines, we can provide an experience that makes the game development process so much easier!",
