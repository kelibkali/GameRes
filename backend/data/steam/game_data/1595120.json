    "description": "Chain Drop is an action and puzzle game. Your goal is to make matches of four or more drops. Each drop you clear will create bubbles that add an amount of liquid depending on the chain size to the tank. Try to setup chains to help you survive the later levels where liquid will drain quicker. Use the Power Bubbles that are generated from chains when you need an extra boost. There are three modes including a fast paced progressive mode that you must keep making chains to stay alive and increase your score and a puzzle mode in which you must try to clear the drops in the least amount of swaps.",
