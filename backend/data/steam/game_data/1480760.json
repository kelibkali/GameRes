    "description": "With their latest expansion Stairports Sceneries have created another beautiful airport scenery for X-Plane 11. This scenery depicts an extremely detailed recreation of Greater Moncton Roméo LeBlanc International Airport located 4 miles east northeast of downtown Moncton. Moncton is one of the three major urban centers in the Canadian province of New Brunswick.<br><br>The scenery features a highly detailed recreation of the airport with a custom colored orthophoto and seasonal textures. Custom taxiway signage as well as custom approach and taxiway lights provides the final touch.<br><br>Thanks to additional PBR textures for the ground and objects plus custom animations for the jetways and service vehicles (SAM AirportVehicles required), there is nothing left to interface with the realistic simulation flight experience. Additionally, there are also special winter animations like engine covers on the static aircrafts and taxi light flag markers.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1480760/extras/5d75590246c1db446e324a2c5681b379.webp?t=1607009362\" width=616 height=61 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Detailed recreation of the real Greater Moncton Airport<br></li><li>4K PBR textures for objects and ground<br></li><li>Custom approach and taxi lights and signs<br></li><li>Custom static aircrafts reflecting common real-world traffic<br></li><li>Custom colored orthophoto including height effect<br></li><li>Animated jetways (SAM plugin required)<br></li><li>Animated service vehicles (SAM AirportVehicles required)<br></li><li>Custom Follow Me vehicle (SAM FollowMe required)<br></li><li>Seasonal textures (SAM plugin required)<br></li><li>Special winter animations like engine covers on static aircrafts and taxi light flag markers</li></ul>",
