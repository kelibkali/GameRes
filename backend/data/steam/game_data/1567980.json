    "description": "Tachyon Wars is a 4X space strategy game that offers a gameplay experience focused on the tactical management of a space fleet. Tachyon Wars has it all: exploration of open space, large-scale battles against a crafty AI, and powerful space fleet control. Enhanced by innovative real-time gameplay mechanics, it provides a rich and immersive experience.<br><br>Uncover the secret of dark matter and construct fierce space fleets. Reveal enemies' plans with tachyon scanners and sabotage the enemy cargo flows. Test gravity weapons and bomb them away from their home planets!<br><br>As in many good strategy games, in Tachyon Wars you will have to balance between scanning, running diversion missions, defending your own colonies, and bombing pesky AI (or your best friend?) out. A variety of ship modules brings extra to your strategic planning. Decide on where to move next - an invisible naughty spy, heavy tank, or light and fast attacker? Heavy but defenseless fighter carrier or something that rocks the stars? Choose your weapons: fire and runaway rockets, long-range lasers, or shredding to bits cannons? Or maybe induce a gravity wave explosion that crumples everything around including the firing ship?<br><br>Planet management in Tachyon Wars is simplified, revolving around economic triangle (new!). The economy triangle allows to players to easily decide between science-oriented planets, mining operations, or production centers without tedious planet constructions. Make sure your frontline planets have planet defense to sustain bombing.<br><br>Gameplay video<br><br><br>Planet resources are scarce, so you would need to organize and support a chain of supplies from mining to building planets. Destroying supplies will break the economy of even the strongest, so bring a lot of attention to planet scanners, scout patrols, and don't forget spying on your own!<br><br>Tachyon Wars was envisaged as a multi-player experience and runs in real-time, to support simultaneous multiplayer games. Though this is different from typical RTS games, here you can pause the game and plan your next move.<br>You can play games with a mixed set of computer or human players. Cooperative or PvP - it's your choice. Beware, the AI tactics are tailored for clever veteran strategy players and won't keep you bored!<br><br>Tachyon Wars provides skirmish mode (aka Single Player) to toughen yourself against AI, develop new skills to show off in the future multiplayer games.<br><br>Please follow our YouTube channel to watch the latest videos:<br>",
