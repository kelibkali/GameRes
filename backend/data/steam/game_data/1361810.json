    "description": "be you 2 is an interactive story / visual novel where your choices shape the outcome. In this sequel to &quot;be you&quot;, you must raise a child by choosing how to react to different situations - but be warned, life doesn't always go according to plan. Your decisions shape your child's personality, which leads to multiple routes and endings. So what kind of parent are you going to be, and what sort of person will Bonny grow into? As Bonny matures and deals with life's challenges, she will eventually have to face her demons...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nbe you 2 comes from the mind of artist/writer/designer Louis Morel, creator of highly rated &quot;be you&quot;, and features dozens of brand new illustrations and over 15,000 words of story, this time with optional fully-voiced narration by the creator.",
