Join our official &quot;WWII Online&quot; Discord to connect with the &quot;Rats&quot; (Developers) and follow our progress.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Paratroopers and Stormtroopers</h2><br>Strap on your U.S. paratrooper or German Wehrmacht battle dress and get pumped for the adrenaline rush of 36-player PvP action in shell-torn towns and the ravaged battlegrounds of Europe. With purpose-built historical maps designed both for close-quarters action and team-based tactical finesse, this shooter offers a fine balance between playability, authenticity, and realism.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Are you ready to scream for your life?</h2><br>Focusing on the intensity of infantry action, WWII Online: Chokepoint sets a new standard for immersion. Our 3D voice system will make you feel like a real soldier on the Western Front. Not everyone has their own radio, so if you want to reach your teammate, way off in the flooded fields of La Fière, you're going to have to yell. But watch out, because if he can hear you, so can the enemy!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1576780/extras/fbe450faaae0ac0a4778df863cb0fb3b.poster.avif?t=1738970912\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1576780/extras/fbe450faaae0ac0a4778df863cb0fb3b.webm?t=1738970912\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1576780/extras/fbe450faaae0ac0a4778df863cb0fb3b.mp4?t=1738970912\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Make every shot count</h2><br>With no HUD and only your eyes to help you in the foggy night of the Battle of Eglise, sometimes it might be hard to tell if you've hit your mark. Combined with our realistic damage model, your shots can do more than just kill! From shooting the weapon out of your opponent's hands to slowing down a retreating enemy by going for the legs, combat isn't just about hitting your target. But be careful, some shots may knock your enemies down, but there's no guarantee they're down for the count...<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1576780/extras/907d5cfe9ea5d3f4eb8d8c791640c746.poster.avif?t=1738970912\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1576780/extras/907d5cfe9ea5d3f4eb8d8c791640c746.webm?t=1738970912\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1576780/extras/907d5cfe9ea5d3f4eb8d8c791640c746.mp4?t=1738970912\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Immersion to the hilt</h2><br>WWII Online: Chokepoint aims to provide all the ingredients for spectacular and memorable experiences.
