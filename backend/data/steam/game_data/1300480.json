As part of the Cleanup Crew for <strong>&lt;REDACTED&gt;</strong> you are designated to go in after we have detected an entrant dying to an anomaly and retrieve vital components for us. These components will then be re-used on new entrants as part of the <strong>&lt;REDACTED&gt;</strong> Program. For the most part, you should be safe as any anomaly that has killed an entrant will more than likely ignore you. In case of emergencies where an anomaly does attempt to attack you, there are designated safe rooms which are safe against most anomalies. These safe rooms can sometimes contain vital equipment to ensure you continue on through the <strong>&lt;REDACTED&gt;</strong> Rooms, gathering these vital components for <strong>&lt;REDACTED&gt;</strong> Company. In case of injuries, dismemberment, or death: the <strong>&lt;REDACTED&gt;</strong> Company is not to be deemed liable as part of your contract you have officially signed when onboarding into the <strong>&lt;REDACTED&gt;</strong> Company. In case of any one of the above occurring and vital components are lost in the <strong>&lt;REDACTED&gt;</strong> Rooms, a new Cleanup Crew will be sent in to retrieve them.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1300480/extras/04ce4b95a6c1716ed7b9bae7b8f1b37e.avif?t=1754721607\" alt=\"A store image banner stating in full capitalization: Objectives.\" width=800 height=66 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Your job (in your new career) is to enter the<strong> LEVELS</strong> for Cleanup.
