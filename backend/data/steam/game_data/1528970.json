Control two protagonists in parallel as they start to realize they're more than human. Decide who to trust when supernatural and human groups each have their own agendas, and ancient truths about you and your companions start to resurface.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This is a world where magic has mostly been forgotten, but with Ragnarök approaching, strange events are taking shape... especially in the lives of Althea and Farkas, a young woman and man living on the city-ship of New Reykjavík. You control both of them as they face mysterious assassins, their own emerging abilities, and hints of the roles they may choose to play in world-shaking events to come. They can become friends, rivals, or even lovers with a variety of companions—including each other—as they navigate a web of potential allies and enemies... including gods, monsters, governments, corporations, and criminals.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1528970/extras/5347f0b0c4731f64909437acf7818e6f.poster.avif?t=1766362675\" aria-label=\"Animated gif showing characters running and fighting in a cyberpunk city\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1528970/extras/5347f0b0c4731f64909437acf7818e6f.webm?t=1766362675\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1528970/extras/5347f0b0c4731f64909437acf7818e6f.mp4?t=1766362675\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1528970/extras/e4e563ac4264a10f462f0524dacc8abf.webp?t=1766362675\" alt=\"Features\" width=780 height=63 /></span></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Fully voiced dialog!</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Choose how the world ends (hundreds of variables shape your story)!</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Choose which characters will become your allies, enemies, friends, rivals, or lovers.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >An episodic story released over time, where choices carry over between chapters and seasons.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Over 100k words in the demo and first installment of episodic chapters.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1528970/extras/6fc44e1c184040149086c3dff9bab73e.webp?t=1766362675\" alt=\"Characters\" width=780 height=63 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The two player characters encounter companions who can share their journey toward the apocalypse.
