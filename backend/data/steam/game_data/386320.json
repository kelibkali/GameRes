Track him using an A.L.I.F.A. mask and limit his ability to hunt you down. <br><br>Use gates, cubes or mirrors corresponding to the attached rooms. Remember, there are few steps for Naninight to make in each room before he gets you. <br><br>You are going to face 3 rounds consisting of 3 phases each, and 3 rounds on Hardcore to get to the truth. <br><br>Spend power wisely, use the mirror and don’t lose your mind — <strong>it’s night time...</strong><br><br><br>",
