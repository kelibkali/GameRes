Jump, Squeeze, Double Jump, and Shoot to save BlubBlub and his blub friends!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game begins with BlubBlub dancing in a meadow, chasing butterflies and being its Blubby self, when BlubBlub encounters Jennifer, an evil scientist bent on building the world’s greatest cosmetics empire.  Jennifer is out on a hunt to extract cuteness from anything and everything in sight to create the world's finest line of make up. It just so happens, BlubBlub is the cutest blub there ever was...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile BlubBlub is just beginning to warm up to a conversation, evil Jennifer captures an unsuspecting BlubBlub in her syringe (!)  After waking up in a cell-like room, BlubBlub discovers it must now parkour its way out, while rescuing its bestfriend, Blobby, who isn’t doing very well (labs...experiments.. you get the drift)",
