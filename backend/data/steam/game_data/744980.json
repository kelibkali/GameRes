In the first phase, the player in control of the ball will decide what they’re going to do. The player has many options depending where they are on the pitch. If they’re near the goal they can shoot or if they’re out wide they can cross, but they can always dribble and pass.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/extras/3289a092292c1ccea9348cb0426f8418.poster.avif?t=1680343143\" width=480 height=196 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/extras/3289a092292c1ccea9348cb0426f8418.webm?t=1680343143\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/extras/3289a092292c1ccea9348cb0426f8418.mp4?t=1680343143\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>The following phase, phase two, the other users on the team with possession will take their turn.

They’ll likely be trying to attempt to get to the ball before the team in possession by receiving the ball earlier in the pass. If you’ve dribbled they’ll have the opportunity to tackle you if their players are fast enough to keep up with you! If you’ve taken a shot then the goalkeeper will attempt to save it, but be wary as they don’t always hold onto their shots.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/extras/35231f05757bc8e1b31056f208592c99.poster.avif?t=1680343143\" width=480 height=196 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/extras/35231f05757bc8e1b31056f208592c99.webm?t=1680343143\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/extras/35231f05757bc8e1b31056f208592c99.mp4?t=1680343143\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>The final phase is where you see everything played out in front of you on the pitch.

You can either be a player or a manager, but for now we will focus on the player creation.<br><br><br><u><strong>Player Characters </strong></u><br>Every time you create a new player you’ll be given a couple of options. Firstly, you need to decide which position to play. Are you interested in only scoring goals? Do you want to create a tricky winger? Do you prefer to play as the commanding centre back? This is your opportunity to choose. After you pick your position you’re going to need to pick your build. Do you focus more on speed and agility or are you more concerned with having good technique? We provide varied builds for each position based on different playstyles and you can choose one to suit you.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/extras/a4377667e2cc783840eb393b89361a04.poster.avif?t=1680343143\" width=480 height=196 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/extras/a4377667e2cc783840eb393b89361a04.webm?t=1680343143\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/extras/a4377667e2cc783840eb393b89361a04.mp4?t=1680343143\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Once you’ve chosen your position and build, you’re going to be asked how you want your player to develop. You’ll have three options here:<br><br><strong>Early Peak</strong> - You will train better when you’re younger and race to your full potential, but your peak potential will be lower than average. This is best used if you want to dominate at a younger age against players of a similar age.<br><br><strong>Mid Peak</strong> - This is the middle of the road player development, you’ll develop at an average pace and hit an average potential. This build allows you to build your player up to a higher peak than the early peak build without having to wait as long as the late peak build<br><br><strong>Late Peak</strong> - As you get older you train better and your overall potential is the highest, the best build if you want a longer career at the top of the game.<br><br>Once your player is created you need to get yourself a contract. Head over to your player profile and you’ll be able to view the available trial contracts. You can request to sign a trial contract for any team with availability but you’ll probably want to include some information for your prospective manager so he’s more inclined to accept it. You’ll also want to start training your player to increase your attributes, but training is increased when you’re under contract at a club so it’s a good idea to get a contract sorted as soon as you can. You can train every day and you choose which attributes you want to focus on, do you improve your physical attributes or your technical attributes? The choice is yours with over 20 different attributes available and they all affect how you perform on the pitch.<br><br><strong><u>Manager Characters</u></strong><br>If you want to head into the world of management then you’re going to want to create a manager character. The process here is a lot less complicated in terms of creating the character but you’re going to need to create a club as well. We have a kit and badge creator in game, so you are really able to give your club a unique identity. You’ll be in charge of signing players, setting the tactics and selecting the team but that’s not all. The financial side of the club will be in your hands too, where you’ll need to look at upgrading your stadium and training facilities when the time is right.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/extras/3ba303f0074f917e270b13cb24aac54b.poster.avif?t=1680343143\" width=480 height=196 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/extras/3ba303f0074f917e270b13cb24aac54b.webm?t=1680343143\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/extras/3ba303f0074f917e270b13cb24aac54b.mp4?t=1680343143\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Jump into tournaments with your team to take on other teams from around the globe. Currently we are running a European ladder at 8pm UTC and an Americas ladder at 1am UTC. These tournaments let the club choose what days they’d like to play matches and automatically schedules a match against another club looking to play. Can you climb to the top of the ladder? We’re going to be introducing leagues and cups soon too, so the ladder is good practice for the future.",
