Fast-paced with a primary focus on gunplay rather than bullet hell, DreadStar gives you incremental ways of not only pushing through content, but also improving your ship and its loadout (such as experience, leveling and skill points). <br><br>If you’re struggling with a sector, you can warp over to Redbeard’s Burrow to spend credits, upgrade your ship and return to where you failed. From Gauss Cannons to Lazer Beams, Hadron Exploders to weapon cooling - ship improvements are key to not only choosing your playstyle but progressing through harder difficulties. <br><br>With its 4:3 display and CRT mode, to its multiple difficulty settings that offer replayability across its 6 sectors, DreadStar provides an authentic retro experience.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/809820/extras/f7d81f909de71f373918a8edb04be7b0.poster.avif?t=1602326786\" width=600 height=450 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/809820/extras/f7d81f909de71f373918a8edb04be7b0.webm?t=1602326786\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/809820/extras/f7d81f909de71f373918a8edb04be7b0.mp4?t=1602326786\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/809820/extras/2930a66ce604dd004c6d407e4a15125b.avif?t=1602326786\" width=600 height=66 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fast shoot 'em up gameplay with epic boss fights.<br></li><li>4 different ships and 10 different weapons to annihilate your opponents. <br></li><li>Tons of customization options from armors and engines, to shields and special items.<br></li><li>Gain experience, level-ups and skill points to incrementally improve your ship’s strength. <br></li><li>6 replayable sectors filled with unique enemies, bosses and minibosses.<br></li><li>3 difficulty settings for every sector, where you’ll need to improve both your skill and your ship to progress.<br></li><li>Gorgeous pixel art, cutscenes and a kick-ass chiptune soundtrack made on the famed Atari-ST and ZX Spectrum.<br></li><li>A 4:3 display and CRT mode for that authentic retro experience.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/809820/extras/DreadStarUpgrades.gif?t=1602326786\" /></span>",
