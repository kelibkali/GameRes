    "description": "Every year millions of monarch butterflies overwinter in the mountains of Mexico. Dances with Butterflies lets you stand in a clearing in the forest and conduct clouds of monarch butterflies to music. Use your VR controllers as wands to conduct them and the trackpad to draw them closer or push them further away. Conduct to The Monarch Waltz by Cliff Eastabrook - or use the music in your head.<br><br>Take a break from the carnage of other games. Clear your head by standing in a mountain glade and gently conduct wafting clouds of beautiful monarch butterflies. Or start your day with five meditative minutes of peace and tranquility.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/893640/extras/705334ea189f8a90107cd74d57f59c65.avif?t=1555595112\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/893640/extras_big/705334ea189f8a90107cd74d57f59c65.avif?t=1555595112 width=800 height=450 /></span>",
