    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Updated in April with new features!</h2><i>TheGameCreators policy is to keep improving our applications and DLCs.</i><br><br>The <strong>AppGameKit Classic Visual Editor</strong> helps you design your apps faster and easier!

From there you can visually modify the media with controls to re-position, scale, rotate, set properties, duplicate and more.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/650840/extras/2b61193c92233b4e09201d88f3b6aca2.avif?t=1717091576\" width=640 height=360 /></span><br><br><strong>Setting Object Properties</strong><br>Visual Editor provides an easy way for object properties to be set up. You simply click on an object and its current properties will be displayed; you're then able to easily change any of the starting values for that object.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/650840/extras/fe1a87b208bd3ed2a3ba9b6426feb2d6.avif?t=1717091576\" width=266 height=380 /></span><br><br>The sprite properties you can configure are:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Depth<br></li><li>Visible<br></li><li>Flip Vertical<br></li><li>Flip Horizontal<br></li><li>Colour<br></li><li>Alpha<br></li><li>Physics - 9 settings<br></li><li>Collision Shape<br></li><li>Animation<br></li><li>Custom values</li></ul><br>You can also add in Text and Edit Box objects.<br><br><strong>Multiple Scenes</strong><br>Most apps will have more than one game scene (main menu, game play, game over, high score, etc). This is where the Visual Editor scene manager helps you. Simply choose a scene and design the items that need to appear within it.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/650840/extras/6352d45aa462ac4986a3624f213fe4f2.avif?t=1717091576\" width=640 height=360 /></span><br><br><strong>Cross Device Testing</strong><br>With the multiple resolution support you can preview how your app will look on different devices that have varying resolutions and aspect ratios. You choose a base resolution and from that the Visual Editor will re-scale and re-position your sprites across the various, different resolutions. You can also make adjustments in any resolution to ensure your app looks the best on any device.<br><br><strong>Exporting and testing</strong><br>The AppGameKit Classic Visual Editor integrates with the Tier 1 IDE allowing you to instantly test your visual projects. A project file is exported which you can then modify with your own code to bring your game logic to life. For Tier2 C++ developers a template project is provided.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/650840/extras/7093b5d422cdd251e40b17241150167a.avif?t=1717091576\" width=640 height=364 /></span>",
