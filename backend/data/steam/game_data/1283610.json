    "description": "The year is 2113 and through science the world has found peace. There are no more wars- only intense competition in Protoball.<br><br>Protoball is a futuristic sports game with a unique blend of basketball and soccer crossed with high tech futuristic style &amp; competitive FPS gameplay. Players athletically jump, slide, run, and dash their way around the arena trying to pass the Protoball through the opponents goal. <br><br>We are currently still in early development, and our vision for Protoball is grand. In addition to the core sports mode we'll be adding Dodgeball and other fun game modes. Protoball will have cosmetic DLC and customizable outfits &amp; VFX. No paying for loot crates with a <i>chance </i>at the item, you'll always be able to purchase the exact item you want. All purchases will be purely cosmetic and <u><i>never </i></u>affect gameplay. We intend to have a large and ever growing catalog of custom styles so that you can truly make your character your own.<br><br>Protoball will host official leagues and tournaments with high frequency. We're building Protoball from the ground up to be an eSport that hardcore and casual gamers alike can enjoy. We will always listen to, and value, our player base. Together we want to make Protoball the best that it can be.",
