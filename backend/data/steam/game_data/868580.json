As they begin to rebuild their lives in this new home and meet the townsfolk of Haven, they quickly discover that not everything is what it appears to be.

A lifelong interest in video games, pen &amp; paper role playing games, and horror stories compelled us to start our own company, where we make the kind of games we like to play and telling the stories we like to tell. WNG came out of what started as a collaborative effort to write a horror novella.  While iterating and fleshing out the structure of the story, it became apparent this story would lend itself to being told within the medium of an adventure game.  A larger framework was then conceived, which could support an overarching story that could be told through various gaming media, both digital and analog.<br><br><strong><u>A SPECIAL NOTE FROM THE DEVELOPER:</u></strong><br>While there isn't overt gore or on-screen violence in <i>Arkhangel</i>, there is subject matter and imagery that some might find disturbing.  This is a mature game experience.",
