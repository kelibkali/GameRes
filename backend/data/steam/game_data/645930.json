A region once flourishing and vibrant, now devastated and deserted. The day Perunium – a previously unknown, superconductive element ­– was discovered in the area, marked the fast and inevitable collapse of the entire territory. Once the governments and corporations were done extracting this new source of income, they evacuated all civilians and closed the region, declaring it neutral.<br><br>Life abhors a vacuum, however, so it didn't take long for the first illegal miners to appear – and it took even less time for a quiet war between the main economic powers to start. Nothing was going on in the Zone according to the news – no bloodshed, and only a couple of random punks breaking the &quot;keep away&quot; order. Journalists belittled the whole thing reporting &quot;zero killed&quot;. Case closed. Scavengers who remained in the Zone started calling themselves &quot;Zeros&quot;: people whose lives are a dime a dozen, their deaths not even counted as casualties.<br><br>A few years later, only professional Zeros remain in the Zone – people who have abandoned their past and broke any contact with former employers. You take the role of one of them. You are one of the Zeros.",
