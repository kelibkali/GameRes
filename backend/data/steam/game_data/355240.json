    "description": "<strong>TWO FISH ENTER, ONE FISH LEAVES. </strong><br><br>This is a competitive 3D shooting game based on crustaceans.<br><br>Yes, you read that right. <br><br>You get to control unique creatures like lobsters, crabs and barnacles, in a wild water world that exceeds all human sense. <br><br>Experience intense battles that take place in “NEO AQUARIUMS,” dimensionally linked aquariums that promote the evolution of organisms, and use skills that are unique to arthropods, such as “molting” and “self-amputation.” <br><br>You can even customize your own aquarium by placing the small creatures and pieces of terrain you earn in battle. Use your wild nature and your strategic skills to become the King of Crustaceans!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Game Modes </strong></h2><br><strong>- Story Mode </strong><br>In this mode, you battle all kinds of aquatic creatures while enjoying the tantalizing story. <br><br><strong>- Free Battle Mode </strong><br>You can play local competitive multiplayer for up to 4 players using split-screen, or you can battle online via Steam network. <br><br><strong>- Aquarium Edit Mode </strong><br>Here you can use the parts you earned in Story Mode to customize your own stages. The creatures you place will come to your aid during combat.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Message from the creator </strong></h2><br>Have you ever really looked at the crawfish and crabs you eat so casually every day? <br><br>Their hard shells, their sharp claws and spines, their 10 legs that they can amputate in case of emergency, their compound eyes that allow them to see in all directions... <br><br>They are beautiful fighting creatures, shaped by nature to survive with only their bodies in the hostile environment of the deep sea. <br><br>In most video games, human beings shoot lasers and fly through the sky as if it’s nothing, but I asked myself the question: “What if lobsters and crabs had these kinds of powers?” <br><br>Nature’s strategies sometimes far exceed the creativity of humans. <br><br>If you reach a deadlock in the human struggles of your daily life, try turning your eyes towards nature; I’m sure you’ll find quite an unexpected battle for survival there.",
