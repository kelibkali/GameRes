Attempting to trigger an emotional response from our AI Test Subject, in hopes of achieving sentiance. We have found that two of the main pillars for human emotion seem to be Trust and Misery which helps dictate human reactions.<br><br>During the previous experiment, Vectromirror 0, the Test Subject failed to grasp these emotional responses. Thus failing to achieve sentience. Despite these setbacks, we are confident that our goal is still within reach.<br><br>Step 1: Rebuilding the Experiment would come across better than just rebuilding the simulation<br><br>This new simulation, <i>“Vectromirror™”</i>—contains more advanced, rigorous trials than its predecessor experiment. The Test Subject still needs to traverse each course. Optimizing the Test Subject's pre-existing set of &quot;special abilities&quot; (e.g., wall-running, double jumping, parkour, etc.). Also added are a stasis hold/throw ability, which allows the Test Subject to further exercise creativity in puzzle solving and an ability to overcome obstacles.<br><br>At least, our previous experiment successfully proves that creatively implemented logic does correlate with humanlike emotional responses. We are confident that this new simulation will produce an undeniably, humanlike emotional state.<br><br>Vectromirror 0 is free for those in the community who wish to experience the initial experiment. Test Subjects may benefit from additional training in the previous courses if the new obstacles in Vectromirror prove to be more challenging.<br><br><strong>Click Here To Access Vectromirror 0</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1386990/extras/536cb56349eb4dbb9dafcb03e26108f5.avif?t=1685206897\" width=313 height=85 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Advanced Movement and Reflexes</h2>The Test Subject proved capable of moving at breakneck speeds during initial testing. However, this did not optimize our desired mobility capabilities for the Test Subject despite this promising initial result.<br><br>The Test Subject may now traverse surfaces easily while locking securely onto said surfaces.<br><br><i>Additional note: Each time the Test Subject is deployed, a different level of reflexive memory adaptability is produced. This variance should be closely observed. </i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Force Pull, Hold, and Push</h2>Our previous test focused on the Test Subject's ability to remove objects in its path via push and pull manipulation. Unfortunately, this did not advance the AI's response system with enough significance, rendering this method insufficient.<br>However, we decided to keep the Test Subject's ability to create massive blasts of energy intact. Rather than simple object manipulation, as was the case in the previous test, the Test Subject's energy blasts now allow it to hold objects in a suspended state and propel objects in a specific direction.<br><br><i>This allows the Test Subject to advance through the simulation and deactivates barriers in a far less...forceful manner than before (more surgically).</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Accelerated Jumping</h2>Further optimization includes its accelerated jump ability—more commonly known as a &quot;double jump.&quot; We have increased the accessibility of this ability by allowing the &quot;double jump&quot; to activate so long as the Test Subject's first jump initiates from a solid surface.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Instant Memory Recall Upon Destruction</h2>We have also continued to allow for the Test Subject to &quot;reload&quot; its scenario progress to an earlier point (a &quot;checkpoint&quot;) should it meet its demise. Besides, this instant recall ability will allow us to determine the effectiveness of the Test Subject's emotional stimuli.",
