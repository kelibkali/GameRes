Our goal is to make learning abstract concepts simple and easy for anyone, anywhere.<br><br>Current Problem:  According to the largest international study on student achievement (TIMSS), the majority of students report that they do not enjoy learning mathematics and science by the 8th grade. Unfortunately, while most industries have modernized over time, the traditional classroom has remained largely unchanged.<br><br>Our Model: We believe students learn best when they learn by experience. Our exploration-based interactive VR is designed to augment education beyond the traditional classroom.<br><br>Visit: codonvr (dot) com",
