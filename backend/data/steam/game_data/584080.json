    "description": "Stay focused and aim well to win against the aggressive and vicious Proton Ball! How many mistakes you make will determine who wins and who loses.<br><br>Proton Ball is a VR sports game, kind of a mix between a game of Dodge-ball and a Shooting Range.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Multiplayer on LAN only</h2><br>The Proton Ball really likes to hit players on the head. If it hits you, your adversary earns one point. Use your Proton-Gun to shoot the ball so it becomes your ally and to boost its aggressivity, but beware, nothing is stopping the other player from doing the same. Protect yourself by using your shield and by dodging. First to reach ten points wins the game.<br><br><strong><u>This game is available for commercial use only. (VR Arcades)</u></strong>",
