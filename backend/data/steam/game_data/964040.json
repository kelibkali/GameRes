    "description": "Snood is one of the most popular puzzle games of all time.<br />\r\nSnood is a fun puzzle game that tests your intellect rather than your reflexes.<br />\r\nThe gameplay is identical to Snood you know from the 90's.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour goal is to save all the trapped Snoods by launching other Snoods at them.<br />\r\nIf you connect three or more identical Snoods, they will disappear.<br />\r\nIf that leaves any Snoods not connected to the top of the playing field, they will fall to safety.<br />\r\nDon't take too long, though - every Snood you launch increases the danger level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSnood is simple to learn but difficult to master and therefore great for ages 2 - 102!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nForget Life, Play SNOOD!",
