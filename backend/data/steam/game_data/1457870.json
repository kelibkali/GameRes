    "description": "Peasants is a city builder for players who like to spend hours on making the best looking city they can yet still have to that element of micro management. In this game, you will have the ability to 'jump off grid' and build a city reminiscent of old medieval villages with natural flowing organic growth, adapting to the terrain instead of controlling it. Start of at the basic level, a small camp in an unexplored land and spend your time building it up to a bustling town full of peasants for you to please..<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeasants also puts a focus on building up your villagers, keeping them happy, improving their skills and utilizing them as best you can. Implementing a soft RPG system into each peasant allows them to have traits and skills that make them better or worse at tasks, jobs or just living. Do you keep the old woman with warts? She might be good at brewing potions but nobody wants to live anywhere near her! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nJump in, get lost in the world and spend hours adding the little details that make 'Your village YOUR village'.",
