    "description": "<strong>Spirit is a casual animal simulator. Join with your friends to socialize and live the life of an animal. Hunt for your food, adapt to the changing environment, find your mate and produce the next generation to continue the search for paradise. Help them grow and they will be stronger, faster and more resilient than ever. But do be warned, mutations can be a good or a bad thing. </strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1137980/extras/Hunt3.png?t=1612897483\" /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Multiplayer Servers</h2>Spirit is meant to be played with friends and a big community. We are aiming to have servers perform well with upwards of 150 players online at once. We will host multiple official servers with different game modes around the world. We will also release the server files to community leaders who wish to host their own private server with custom rules. Realism and Roleplaying is very popular among this genre and we will provide many tools to assist with server management.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Different Game Modes</h2>Our final vision for our game is multiple game modes to suit a variety of gameplay styles. Sandbox, you can play whatever and do whatever here. Survival, you will grow over time and require food and water to survive. You will have to find a grazing spot or hunt another animal. Once you grow up, you can find a mate and reproduce. Each time you reproduce successfully, you have a chance to collect a mutation. More on mutations below. Ascension will be about going from the bottom of the food chain to the top. You start out as a small animal like a rat and end up as an apex predator. You are reincarnated into a higher being when you grow old, have enough karma points and die. We will add more game modes as we reach out to the community for more feedback<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Collectables</h2>We are planning to have many skins for each animal and to acquire those skins, we will enable drops on official servers. The more time you spend on the servers, the better chance of getting your favorite skins. We are also adding collectable mutations. Mutations can be colors, ability and visual. Want an albino skin? Better go start procreating and hope you are lucky!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story Mode</h2>Don't like the competitive multiplayer atmosphere? Then story mode is for you. Each animal will have a unique story mode to play through at your own pace. There will be different maps for each animal, fitting to their natural habitat. You will encounter challenges, puzzles and enemies to fight or avoid. You will raise babies and teach them the skills necessary to survive the relentless fury of mother nature. After completing each story, you will be rewarded with a variety of skins.",
