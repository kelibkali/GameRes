Find out!).<br>Make sure that your guests are always taken care of by a well-chosen staff, maintain high standards of torture and remember that each purified soul leaves its sins with your wallet – it is in your best interest to develop the greatest resort in your corner of hell!<br><br>DEVELOP <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1222960/extras/8473c70308357ca27cf3fc48a355aa10.poster.avif?t=1653992127\" width=576 height=180 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1222960/extras/8473c70308357ca27cf3fc48a355aa10.webm?t=1653992127\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1222960/extras/8473c70308357ca27cf3fc48a355aa10.mp4?t=1653992127\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>You have been selected to manage Afterlife hotels!
