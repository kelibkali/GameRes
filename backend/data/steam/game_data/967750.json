Fly at blisteringly high speeds in all directions. Unreal Tournament and Quake have inspired the fast respawn times, weapon drops throughout the maps, and the need to keep moving at all times.<br><br>We have designed 20+ unique weapons and power-ups that will explore every aspect of aerial combat, and six different Aerobots with varying armor and speed stats. Play on 10+ maps featuring a diverse style of futuristic settings and landscapes in game modes such as Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and Gun Game.<br>​<br>Multiplayer: The online interface focuses around a public lobby system on dedicated servers. People can create games, and populate them with AI bots. Players can then easily drop in and out of matches, replacing AI bots when they join, and spawning AI bots when they leave. This casual, fast-paced method of joining games is meant to make finding an online match as easy and quick as possible. We have put a lot of effort into making the AI bots as player-like as possible, with very solid AI already implemented in our online matches.<br>​<br>Single-player/Co-op: The single-player/co-op gameplay will be non-linear, replayable missions that can be played with AI or human teammates. They can be played offline or loaded up in the same lobby as competitive multiplayer. Inspired by Crimson Skies, Rogue Squadron, and Star Fox, dialog and story elements will play out over the comms channels, as players work together to take over territory, protect cargo ships, and defend against waves of enemies.",
