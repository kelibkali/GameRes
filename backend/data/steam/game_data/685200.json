    "description": "Have you ever been bored on your desktop drawing selection boxes with no real purpose, but found it fun? Seconds to Square is a momentum-based action-platformer that takes this motion and turns it into a time manipulation mechanic!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDrawing boxes in Seconds to Square works exactly like selecting folders on your desktop! Draw a fast box by left clicking to augment your run speed and jump height or draw a slow box by right clicking to dodge projectiles!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe goal of Seconds to Square is to race against the clock as you draw boxes using left and right clicks to speed up or slow down time.",
