You will experience a grand adventure through 4 kingdoms wherein you can use mysterious creatures as both allies or weapons! It's entirely up to you how you will travel through this world, defeating the Ancient Gods and discovering the universe's mysteries as you do.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Action RPG + Turn RPG at same time!</strong></h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2017510/extras/62ee5022ee4847f3c24e7d95ef9dd3e9.poster.avif?t=1755277411\" width=400 height=224 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2017510/extras/62ee5022ee4847f3c24e7d95ef9dd3e9.webm?t=1755277411\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2017510/extras/62ee5022ee4847f3c24e7d95ef9dd3e9.mp4?t=1755277411\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Essentures mixes Action and Turn RPG combat systems in a unique system that encapsulates strategic thinking of RPGs and the thrill of real-time combat! To achieve this, the mechanics of both genres were blended in such a way so as to limit the weaknesses of both while exemplifying their strengths. This, mixed with many new mechanics, the reimagining of existing mechanics, a unique battle system, and an epic story creates a unique experience only Essentures can offer!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Over 250 creatures!</strong></h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2017510/extras/54589d364ca77b9b34282ce5522690bd.avif?t=1755277411\" width=616 height=496 /></span><br><br>In Essentures each creature has an infant stage and an adult stage.
