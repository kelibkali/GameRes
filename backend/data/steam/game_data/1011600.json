    "description": "Dungeon Cleaning Express is a 2D action platformer in which you play as a professional dungeon cleaner which uses bombs and dynamite to destroy monsters and other hostile creatures in dungeons and cellars - not that easy but almost always effective and generally lots of fun for a pro! The story is rather simple, like in any action game or movie (because let's be honest  - who needs a complicated and entangled story when you have more than enough action?) and it goes like this: you accept a contract from a new owner of an old mansion to clean the underground beneath the building. Previous owner, quite an eccentric fellow, conducted under his house some really weird experiments and some other things of which we rather wouldn't talk to children... Hmmm... He had a hobby... and now someone has to clean it up... and it looks like it is your job now... So how do You like it? Are you ready for a new adventure?",
