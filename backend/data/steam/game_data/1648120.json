    "description": "<strong>Disgraced</strong><br><br><strong>Trailblazer Expansion DLC:</strong><br><br>The Trailblazer Expansion for Disgraced adds a travel event system for extra replayability and for creating unique playthroughs. The system will randomly select an event and then a unique variation from a list of 15 different travel events - which each have multiple outcomes and variations of their own - every so often while traveling on the world map and add a narrative for it. The idea is to make the journey in between quests and important locations more eventful and unique. Most of these have some kind of action you can take or choose to ignore the event altogether.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Traveling Healer - 3 Variations<br></li><li>Hidden Supply Stash - 25 Variations<br></li><li>Ambush - 24 Variations<br></li><li>Traveling Cook - 3 Variations<br></li><li>Lost Coin Pouch - 5 Variations<br></li><li>Sudden Calm / Heavy Storm - 3 Variations<br></li><li>Wandering Merchant - 2 Variations<br></li><li>Bandits - 2 Variations<br></li><li>Shogun Retaliation - 3 Variations<br></li><li>Diseased Peasants - 5 Variations<br></li><li>Roadside Shrine - 2 Variations<br></li><li>Hungry Wolves - 5 Variations<br></li><li>Samurai Assassins<br></li><li>Bad Omen - 3 Variations<br></li><li>Battle Aftermath - 7 Variations</li></ul><br>Each of the above events have multiple outcomes and many of which have different variations to make each encounter unique.<br><br>*For those of you who have played our fourth game, Lawless Lands, this is an expansion to add the same type of travel event system which Lawless Lands had. This was a popular feature in that game, so it has also been added to Disgraced.*<br><br><strong>PLEASE NOTE: IN ORDER <u>TO ACTIVATE THIS PACK, YOU MUST ACCESS THE SUPPLY CACHE IN YOUR HEAD QUARTERS IN <i>KIBO</i> OR BEGIN A NEW GAME.
