The bosses of the Towers are ruthless, and will stop at nothing to bring Lewis down.<br><br>- Wield the Wrenchblade in intense, real-time combat<br>- Execute numerous combos that require careful stamina management<br>- Whittle down bosses little by little in a simple yet innovative health system<br>- Rejoice when Lewis is victorious, and persist when he falls in battle<br>- Fight alongside heroic music composed by Liam Wofford and Nathan Symes<br><br>Trial of the Towers is <strong><i>completely free</i></strong> and made with Unreal Engine 4. This game is a pure passion project made by us two creative minds wanting to share our skill and creativity with the world. It was originally intended to be a much larger game but neither time nor money relented. The project was shrunk down and cut clean into this final product.",
