Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished former student, decides to murder an old pawnbroker, justifying his act with his own theory of the “right” of a strong individual to break the moral law. But the moment he crosses the threshold of her apartment, he suddenly loses his grip on reality and falls into a waking nightmare—one in which he must pass through the darkness of his own choices.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Guide the protagonist through the foggy streets of Saint Petersburg, through fear, pursuit, and the torment of guilt—and decide where this path will lead him: to downfall, confession, or an attempt at redemption.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4310290/extras/1080583529c1e752f13117dbe1d757c8.poster.avif?t=1770623576\" width=500 height=282 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4310290/extras/1080583529c1e752f13117dbe1d757c8.webm?t=1770623576\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4310290/extras/1080583529c1e752f13117dbe1d757c8.mp4?t=1770623576\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A 2D adventure with elements of horror and survival, immersing you in the atmosphere of the latter half of the 19th century.

Keep an eye on your anxiety level: when it reaches its limit, reality begins to warp, and the city turns into its dark, nightmarish version.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Creatures appear in the streets—embodiments of fear, memory, and the city itself. Survive in whatever way you choose: fight, hide, evade pursuit, or neutralize monsters by other means—using items and the opportunities the environment provides. And sometimes a persistent, haunting shadow begins to trail the protagonist—something that knows too much and won’t let go, no matter which way you turn.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The geography of the locations is based on period maps, but adapted to suit the game’s pacing.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Multiple endings: the finale depends on your choices, actions, and how you cope with pressure.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A grim atmosphere, enhanced by an instrumental soundtrack.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Hand-drawn 2D characters with detailed animation.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Hand-drawn cutscenes that reveal the story and the protagonist’s state of mind.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The game is inspired by Fyodor Dostoevsky’s <i>Crime and Punishment</i> and presents an author’s interpretation built around the images and emotions the novel leaves behind.
