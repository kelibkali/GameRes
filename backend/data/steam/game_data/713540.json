    "description": "It is a platformer without points, coins and lives. If Donut dies you should to start level again. Short and really hard levels. Hard sound (heavy metal, grunge, punk ...). The game is not long about 2-3 hours. Simple control just jump, move forward and back.  Donut moves through a wormhole from the Earth to the Neptune. He attempts to find a way to the Earth. You can help him to come back. Beware of sharks, barrels, UFO, hard sound and hard levels!",
