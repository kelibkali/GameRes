    "description": "[h1]DEMO VERSION[/h1]<br>The demo version is designed to give you a small sample of the type of quality and gameplay that will come with the full game when it eventually launches.<br>The demo will currently feature 6 super fun, and challenging mini-games out of the 30 mini-games Metal Heads will eventually launch with, with more unlocking as the game gets closer to it's release date.<br>You can either choose to play the mini-games by selecting what one you would like to play, or run a continuous random loop.<br><br>This demo does not contain all features, (it is just a handful of mini-games) but will still give you plenty of entertainment when you feel like playing a party game alone or with friends.<br>Most of the mini-games in the demo are crazy survival mini-games, and are a challenge even to play in solo mode, with additional modes for survival mini-games so you are not limited by a timer, but can see how long you survive for.<br>While there are no leaderboards yet, do not hesitate to brag about your survival skills in the forums and compete with the community to see who is the ultimate metal head.<br><br>An added note is that in the gameplay menu, there is a feature to enable melee which allows players to slap one another using LB and RB. While the game wasn't designed with this in mind, and generally becomes infuriating to play, some people enjoy this style of gameplay, and what kind of developer would I be to deny that opportunity.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPER</h2>Metal Heads is made by one person with a day job and busy life, so please bear with me with any bugs and issues, as well as content updates.<br>I am working around the clock to give you guys something super fun and exciting to play, and hope that you can understand that sometimes it will take a few days to resolve certain issues if I cannot immediately fix them.<br>I cannot wait to keep adding content to the demo so you guys can try something new every now and then, this is my passion and I enjoy that others enjoy my creation.<br><br>Thank you all for playing, you guys are awesome! Rock on!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >NOT ALL FEATURES BELOW ARE PART OF THE DEMO</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1215330/extras/d988688b5bffd40a49b6eb3ba5e32134.avif?t=1615732206\" width=480 height=108 /></span><br><br>Metal Heads is a crazy, action packed party game where up to 8 of you and your friends go head to head in a series of challenging, but fun mini-games.<br>Featuring over 30 mini-games, multiple board game modes, character customization, mini-game and board game level editors, with much more content to come post-launch.<br>Metal Heads aims to give you an all round party game experience that will never leave you wanting more and make you want to come back to it for years to come.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1215330/extras/InfoTitle_Multiplayer.png?t=1615732206\" /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >8 PLAYERS LOCAL</h2>Are you tired of looking for party games to play and finding that they only support 4 players?
