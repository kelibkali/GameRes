What's inside? Who lives there? What's your target day schedule? Find out when the house is empty and does it have nosy neighbours. Choose from lots of possible approaches to prepare the best plan. Many modern devices available in Thief Simulator might come in handy with gathering intel about your target and it's neighbourhood.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1019550/extras/a0af99d075a0bb32be8fc88279c09bdf.poster.avif?t=1767348577\" width=590 height=170 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1019550/extras/a0af99d075a0bb32be8fc88279c09bdf.webm?t=1767348577\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1019550/extras/a0af99d075a0bb32be8fc88279c09bdf.mp4?t=1767348577\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>The faster, the better. Find and steal as many valuables as possible in the shortest time possible. Remember that infinite backpacks don't exist. When it's about time you have to maintain cold blood. In every house you'll find tons of useless stuff, which can really slow you down. If you're not sure that you can take some serious money for it, maybe a good idea would be to leave it behind and save space for some expensive goods. If you fill your backpack with worthless items, you may have to waste your time to throw stuff out just to make space for other things. Be careful, cause some things can draw police attention to you!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1019550/extras/897c090e1c5258ad5b56e4b5b1705f25.poster.avif?t=1767348577\" width=590 height=170 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1019550/extras/897c090e1c5258ad5b56e4b5b1705f25.webm?t=1767348577\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1019550/extras/897c090e1c5258ad5b56e4b5b1705f25.mp4?t=1767348577\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>A real, experienced thief can spot places where there's most probability of finding some valuables on the fly.
