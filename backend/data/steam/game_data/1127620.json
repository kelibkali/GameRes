    "description": "ByLo is a quick horror game experience in which you’re given no background story, and you soon realize things are not what they seem. You must explore the asylum to find fragments of a picture, giving clues on how to proceed and of a clearer picture. However, you must be careful not to go completely insane as each action and choice you make has its consequences. You must navigate through all obstacles while trying to find the truth but also trying to remain sane.<br />\r\nFirst attempt on a project",
