    "description": "Action packed strategy game where the goal is to defend a silo in the middle of a wheat field from very hungry crows. Funny little beeps and boops make the game even more enjoyable then the cartoon look. Collect all sorts of power-ups from a crow nuke to a shield of spinning pitchforks. At this farm their is more than one type of crow ranging from slow big ones to small ones with lightning speed. Once you reach a high score of 20 in any session before winter you can unlock the one proceeding it. Have fun and good luck stopping those crazy crows!",
