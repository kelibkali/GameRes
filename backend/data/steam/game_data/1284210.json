Check your content guide for suggestions when you set out on your adventures, consult your compass to find interesting landmarks…or just pick your favorite direction to travel in and let adventure find you. Tyria is full of characters with their own stories and goals, and you'll be rewarded for helping them out—or thwarting their plans—by completing renown hearts and dynamic events. Read our new player guide for more tips!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1284210/extras/fbdf474fbe91421c210a3dba473237c3.poster.avif?t=1769556226\" width=624 height=150 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1284210/extras/fbdf474fbe91421c210a3dba473237c3.webm?t=1769556226\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1284210/extras/fbdf474fbe91421c210a3dba473237c3.mp4?t=1769556226\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>When you meet other players in the open world, you don't need to join their party to lend a helping hand, investigate a secret jumping puzzle, or team up against a deadly world boss. Don't grind; play the way you want to play! Whether you're reviving defeated players, rescuing soldiers from a Risen onslaught, or gathering herbs, you'll earn experience points. <br><br>Arm your character with an arsenal of new weapons as you play. Every profession wields them differently, and each type has its own playstyle, which you can refine and customize by unlocking and equipping hundreds of skills and traits. If you want to jump straight into structured PvP, go for it—every player competes at the same level, with access to the max-level gear and build options you need to make your mark. <br><br>If you love fashion, express yourself with the perfect character design! When you equip new weapons and armor, you'll unlock their skins in your wardrobe. Make them truly yours with thousands of possible combinations and a massive selection of collectible dyes. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1284210/extras/1cb86e3e958a26e8b9b2eb638aa83526.poster.avif?t=1769556226\" width=624 height=150 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1284210/extras/1cb86e3e958a26e8b9b2eb638aa83526.webm?t=1769556226\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1284210/extras/1cb86e3e958a26e8b9b2eb638aa83526.mp4?t=1769556226\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Upgrade your free account with a Guild Wars 2 expansion and get access to log-in rewards, additional character and bag slots, expanded chat features, and more.
