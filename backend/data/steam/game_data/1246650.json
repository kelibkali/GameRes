    "description": "This package contains two games for the price of one :<br><br><br><strong><u>Opus 1 : Utopia - RPG</u></strong><br><br>Welcome to the world capital, flying and futuristic technopole Utopia.<br><br>Investigation / investigation game where you have to find the terrorist who laid the bomb in the lab where the Eternity500 was designed.<br><br>Investigate, travel by shuttle train via the statioport or by flying car through the city. Interrogate passers-by, cybernetic droids, robots or zonards by defeating the traps of the Mafia and its abuses.<br><br>Visit incredible parallel worlds in Real / Semi-Real / Semi-Virtual or Full Virtual mode to restore the matrix variations from which the Matrix suffers.<br><br><strong><u>Opus 2 : The Era of Renewal </u></strong><br><br>Welcome to Utopia (one and the same nation &quot;the<br><br>cited &quot;world&quot;, with only one is the same capital<br><br>&quot;Utopia&quot; international market<br><br>major cities of the five continents.),<br><br>vast flying technopole.<br><br><br>In the distant future, we are in the era of<br><br>Renewal, which follows the Cyberpunk era (which<br><br>takes place in the near future) where the first happens<br><br>opus from the game &quot;Utopia-RPG.&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br>During the Cyber-punk era, the world sinks into a<br><br>terrible decay (overcrowding, disasters<br><br>ecological, natural and energy resources<br><br>almost exhausted, malnutrition, ill-distributed wealth,<br><br>gaps in social disparities, civil revolution,<br><br>armed conflicts, etc.) and at the same time, the<br><br>technology makes a giant leap in all<br><br>areas of human knowledge (I-a, IT,<br><br>medicine, cyborg, robotization, etc.)<br><br><br>Following this, during the Renewal era, the world<br><br>slowly rises from the ashes.<br><br>Little by little, technological progress is such<br><br>that ecological solutions are found for<br><br>improve the lot of the earthly population.<br><br>The world is slowly emerging from the deep coma in which<br><br>he was immersed.<br><br><br>Under the effect of global warming,<br><br>most of the globe is fled underwater.<br><br>(It is for this reason, moreover, that you can<br><br>find that the adventure card contains<br><br>many islets in the middle of the ocean ...)<br><br><br>What is more, there is more or less in all<br><br>fields, whether artistic, architectural,<br><br>scientific, technological, etc. A return to style<br><br>artistic ancient (future-ancient) or middle age<br><br>fantastic (medieval-futuristic.)<br><br><br>It is not necessarily yet very visible to our<br><br>present time or even in the near future ...<br><br>But in the more or less long term, we will get there.<br><br><br><strong><u>Some examples ... </u></strong><br><br>- The first electric cars no longer make<br><br>noises.<br><br>- Cars are flying and therefore less cars<br><br>in the streets (see not at all.)<br><br>- We are now designing farm buildings,<br><br>several floors, to use fewer areas<br><br>terrestrial, which leaves more room for trees and<br><br>to vegetation.<br><br>- Technologies are becoming more and more<br><br>miniature, therefore invisible and soundproof, which makes<br><br>think a little bit about techno-magic.<br><br>- Dress fashion sometimes reminds us of a comeback<br><br>in the past.<br><br>- Energy resources have also changed<br><br>(fossil fuels are becoming scarce, giving way<br><br>to more ecological energies ...)<br><br>- The buildings are becoming greener, asking<br><br>building materials closer to the<br><br>nature (wood-based building, building with walls<br><br>floral, etc.)<br><br>- Etc. Etc. These are just a few examples ...<br><br><br><br>Between two attitudes, sometimes ravaged, sometimes<br><br>rising from the ashes, the world has come to<br><br>the era of Renewal and it is in this universe that<br><br>play your game.<br><br><br><strong><u>Virtual Worlds </u></strong><br><br>In the near future, computers have been replaced<br><br>by projection headsets which allow<br><br>reconstruct everything the five senses can<br><br>pretend to control machines remotely and<br><br>project in a matrix in semi real, semi mode<br><br>virtual or full virtual.<br><br>Sometimes the virtual has implications for the world<br><br>real and vice versa, so that it can<br><br>cause disruption.<br><br>It is therefore possible to walk in worlds<br><br>virtual. The most common of them is a world<br><br>fantastic medieval, which you can access<br><br>to accomplish your mission.<br><br><br><br><strong><u>Some game tips :</u></strong><br><br>- Regularly save your game.<br><br>- At level 1 some &quot;big monsters&quot; are too difficult<br><br>to fight. We must therefore flee (key 0 to return<br><br>basic menu) while waiting to get stronger.<br><br>- Bring a notebook and a pencil to take notes.<br><br>Note which places have already been visited, etc.<br><br><br><br><br><br><strong><u>Content of the two games :</u></strong><br><br>- Over 100 Monsters<br><br>- Several hundred objects, weapons and armor<br><br>- About ten career levels<br><br>- Many maps very well done<br><br>- Forty puzzles<br><br>- 4 Game Modes (Real, Semi-Real, Semi-Virtual, Virtual)<br><br>- A hectic story, many hours of play.<br><br><br>Designer: Christophe Vanhille",
