    "description": "For too long have we relied on cogs and gears to control our lives. Welcome to a new age, the age of steam!<br><br>The simple valve, which controls the flow of steam based on the pressure on it's control ports, is the only component that is needed to revolutionise our control over machines. From simple switches, to adders, tabulators, and eventually entire computers. Your companions will guide you through the discovery of steam based computation. A word of warning though. This game is hard. One can not discover an entire new field of science alone. Which is why an Academy of steam engineers (Discord) is available to you. A friendly community who are happy to assist you and share their latest steam innovations. Each solved challenge yields another useful element that can be used in future designs. Poor solutions in previous stages make poor components to use further on, so you will be coming back to old designs, tuning and optimising them with things you have learned.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Game</h2>The following is a quick walkthrough the game dynamics.<br>It all starts with pipes. Left click to start a pipe and click each time to extend it in the direction of the mouse pointer.
