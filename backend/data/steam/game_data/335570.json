    "description": "The journey of the small beneficial cell reaches its final chapter, through various wonderful microscopic worlds with one goal: to bring life to the surrounding environment by constructing and combining together beneficial bubbles to fill the whole visible fabric. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this last journey, the small cell will cross several biological worlds that represent various states of matter: Solid, Ice, Water, Gas, Plasma. <br />\r\nDuring the adventure, the cell will encounter multiple enemies, random barriers and obstacles of all kinds and with different features, harmless or lethal. <br />\r\nOur protagonist will find while traveling various bonuses that will facilitate the journey. <br />\r\nEach level is procedurally generated, so any game scenario is always unpredictable! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nObjectives of the game<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo revitalize and fill the tissue underneath the small cell will use a method entirely new: the modular bubbles! <br />\r\nBy drawing, closing and joining together the microscopic filaments, the small cell will create a kind of wonderful, colorful and beneficial structure, with which it will be able to overcome the various levels. <br />\r\nThe aim of the game is to fill with organic filaments a certain percentage of the playing field. <br />\r\nThese organic filaments will create bubbles that can be joined together by means of the vertices. <br />\r\nTo pass each level you have to fill the required percentage within a time limit, paying attention to the barriers, obstacles and enemies present. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nComposable Bubbles Engine (CBE):<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis engine allows you to create multiple beneficial bubbles using vertices of existing ones. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMAIN FEATURES:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPROCEDURAL LEVEL GENERATION <br />\r\nLOAD/SAVE CURRENT LEVEL AND GAME STATS <br />\r\nGAME RANKINGS AND HIGH SCORES <br />\r\nON-SCREEN MAP <br />\r\nCOMPOSABLE BUBBLES <br />\r\nORGANIC SCENARIO <br />\r\n500 PROCEDURAL LEVELS <br />\r\nFIVE WORLDS<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore features:<br />\r\nFive camera modes ( normal, dynamic ,‘map’, perspective and dynamic perspective ) <br />\r\nTwo game speeds <br />\r\nTwo game difficulties <br />\r\nTwo enemies speeds<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnemies<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGeneric cell: only stops the creation of bubbles. <br />\r\nBacterium: if touched, it decreases the time available. <br />\r\nVirus: if touched, it increases the filling percentage <br />\r\nSpeed viruses: if touched, it decreases the speed of the protagonist. <br />\r\nParasite “length”: if touched, it lowers the length of the design of the bubble. <br />\r\nParasite “range”: if touched, lowers the lock range with neighboring nodes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBonuses<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTime bonus: increases the time available. <br />\r\nPower up bonus: decreases the rate of filling necessary to pass the level. <br />\r\nSpeed bonus: increases the speed of the protagonist. <br />\r\nLength Bonus: increases the length of the drawing of the bubble. <br />\r\nRange Bonus: increases the range of coupling with the neighboring nodes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWorlds<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWorld 1 - Solid state of matter: ROCK <br />\r\nWorld 2 - Frozen state of matter: ICE <br />\r\nWorld 3 - Liquid state of matter: WATER <br />\r\nWorld 4 - Gaseous state of matter: GAS <br />\r\nWorld 5 - Fluid state of matter: PLASMA",
