    "description": "The smell of tree resin is in the air when Woodcutter Simulator 2011 is started. Here the player is the master of a modern wood processing plant and is allowed to take over pithy tasks – feel as if you were in Canada's forests yourself. <br>In the elaborately staged simulation, the player takes care of all aspects of logging and wood processing and experiences an even more intense game depth through new missions, a larger vehicle fleet and as well new tutorial levels.<br><br>But all fans of the predecessor won't miss out either! Expanded mission landscapes and new tasks are waiting! You can also use the new fully functional harvester. As soon as a task has been completed, the mission landscape can be played as often as desired in free play mode.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The player takes care of a complete woodworking plant<br></li><li>New harvester<br></li><li>Weather effects, light and glare effects<br></li><li>Completely redesigned 3D landscape<br></li><li>New tutorial levels<br></li><li>Numerous new tasks<br></li><li>Whole stumps or logs must be delivered<br></li><li>Profile management for multiple players</li></ul>",
