Similar to trading card packs, you have a chance of getting what you want when you open one. If a player runs out of boxes and still hasn’t gotten what they wanted, additional loot boxes are usually available for purchase. Almost every major game last year included them, blurring the line between games and gambling. Certain forms of loot boxes are now illegal in Belgium and the Netherlands.",
