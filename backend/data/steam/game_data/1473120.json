    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >   Pathfinder RPG - Campaign Setting: Occult Mysteries</h2>The Terrible Truth!<br>Every civilization has its big questions, those mysteries that have plagued generations of scholars. How did humanity rise from barbarism? Why did the gnomes leave the First World? Who are the string-pulling veiled masters? What is the Aucturn Enigma, and what strange powers did it grant the rulers of Osirion? What secret could be so great that it led to the suppression of volume five of the Pathfinder Chronicles?
