    "description": "The game is a few different labyrinths, in which, which may seem strange, you do not need to look for a way out. And you only need to collect polygons, representing the energy for the ship. You have to find orange polygons in the most diverse and hidden corners of the labyrinth. If you do not manage alone, you can call your friend or family member so that you find them together.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures<br />\r\n- Pleasant music<br />\r\n- Meditative gameplay<br />\r\n- Game for two<br />\r\n- Several labyrinths<br />\r\n- Stylish graphics",
