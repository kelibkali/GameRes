    "description": "Trimmer Tycoon is a fast survival game. You’re the new owner of a beard-trimming salon - Shavy. Customers start flowing in with absurd wishes for their beards. Can you satisfy their beardy dreams and keep up with the ever-increasing rent? With only an electric shaver and a pair of scissors as your tools, you dream of one day becoming the best trimmer millionaire in the pixel world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrimmer Tycoon is a shop management game with simulator elements. You start off with an empty shop which you can later expand to a bigger and better one.  Customers find you quickly and your job is to satisfy their beardy dreams to the best of your abilities. Attract more customers by decorating your shop and handle rush hours with skilled employees. The customers expect accurate shaves and colors, but you can’t take too long; the clock is ticking —  you need to make enough money to pay rent!",
