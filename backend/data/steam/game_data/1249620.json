Find the Serpent Empress who keeps the &quot;Golden Buddha&quot;.  JQ Jones must survive going through different mazes not only dodging booby traps and solving to get out of the maze but our hero must also be aware of dangers that protects the Serpent Empress at each level.   Roaming around the maze are the Serpent's minion, guards, archers and the Serpent Warrior that you will need to fight and kill before getting to her.  Each level is full of action and will definitely keep your legs moving!",
