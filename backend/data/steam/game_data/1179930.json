    "description": "<strong>Legends of Aria</strong> is a full loot sandbox MMORPG with a living, breathing world defined and shaped by its player community. It is a world of dangers, where bonds are forged - and broken - by players writing their own stories.<br><br>Explore a persistent, massive open world with thousands of other players and experience the freedom to pursue your own destiny. Master the magical art of music, tame mighty beasts to follow your every command, ascend the ranks of a powerful guild, build an economic empire, or put your skills to the test - and on the line - to hunt other players.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Keep more of your hard earned loot</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1179930/extras/f415ce95280d196b794d02ff03b68ea5.avif?t=1662054906\" width=600 height=200 /></span><br><br>Even though free players can experience all the content Legends of Aria has to offer, citizenship comes with a number of perks, including having more room to store your valuables. Purchasing a Citizen Pass unlocks your bank’s full capacity, allowing you to store more cash and more items from your adventures.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Carve out your place in the world</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1179930/extras/e46fe64a780608b1af496b342074f71d.avif?t=1662054906\" width=600 height=200 /></span><br><br>Citizens of Celador can claim a plot, expand their land, and build a home or run a shop to profit off items they’ve crafted or found during their travels. Home ownership in Celador is reserved for Citizen’s Pass holders.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Form and lead a powerful syndicate</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1179930/extras/7ef06f6563f4f249dfa771e8677fd02a.avif?t=1662054906\" width=600 height=200 /></span><br><br>While free players are able to join a guild, players need to be Citizens in order to form one of their own. Establish and name your guild, recruit fellow players, wage war against opposing guilds, and set out on an adventure based on shared principles, whether you’re a group of dungeoneers or are a ruthless group of outlaws on a quest to establish dominance over your rivals.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Play a different way on Community Servers</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1179930/extras/86049f96a6d833668ead6442c926ec79.avif?t=1662054906\" width=600 height=200 /></span><br><br>Legends of Aria is the first MMORPG to fully support player-run servers.
