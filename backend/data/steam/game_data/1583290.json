We love when players create awesome drama, suspense, and sneaky plays. Our goal with <i>Which Wizard</i> is to take what we like about social deduction, reimagine some elements, and give players the tools to craft a personal strategy around new gameplay layers like subclass spells and map-wide ghost haunts.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >We’re a small team that has been working hard to make something that we (and hopefully you) enjoy playing! Which Wizard began with a humble game jam shortly after the pandemic hit, and it gave us all a creative, communal outlet through hard times that followed. We hope that it brings you closer to new or old friends the same way it brought us together as a team! Nothing says &quot;I care about you&quot; like a little magic murder between friends.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Spread the magic! We have a Discord if you'd like to join for play sessions, devlogs, updates, and more!</p>",
