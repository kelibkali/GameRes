    "description": "Dream's Official Soundtrack, composed by Norman Legies, contains more than 2 hours of music from Dream! It comprises 23 tracks from the game, 18 additional bonus tracks and 2 piano music sheets for everybody interested in the 3 year development of Dream, and the work process of our composer. <br><br><i>Working on Dream was a blast for me. With Dream being my first full video game project, I tried my best to compose music that is moody, melancholic and always a bit wondrous and mystic. I hope you like the O.S.T. and are interested as well in the Bonus content, containing many prototypes, alternate versions and musical studies that I've done during the development. I wanted to present you a complete image of the game's development music-wise, and hope you're having fun comparing versions, seeing similarities, or just enjoy the original soundtrack.<br><br>Thank you very much for listening!<br><br>All the best, Norman.</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >DREAM Official O.S.T.</h2><br>Track List (1:39:47)<br><br>1.
