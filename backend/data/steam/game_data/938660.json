    "description": "A local multiplayer action game where skills and tactics decide who wins.<br>Each player controls of a &quot;kurve&quot;, a curve that always moves forward and is only stopped when crashing into another object. Whenever an opponent crashes while you're still in the game, you score a point. Get to the score limit first to win the game!<br><br>Achtung die Kugel re-imagines the old classic &quot;Achtung die Kurve&quot;. Achtung die Kugel bends achtung-space to kugel-space (sphere-space) and brings the same classic action and skillful gameplay you would expect from an achtung game.<br><br><br>Here's what's in the package:<br><br>- <strong>Action packed gameplay</strong>: one small mistake and you're out for the round!<br><br>- Achtung die Kugel is played on a <strong>Sphere!!</strong><br><br>- <strong>Jumps!</strong> Get out of tight situations or get right in front of an opponent with this skill-intensive feature.<br><br>- <strong>Easy to learn - hard to master</strong>: you can only go left, right or jump. But it takes lots of skill and tactics if you want to win the round!<br><br>- Play <strong>up to 4 players</strong> in two teams or free for all.<br><br>- Different <strong>maps</strong> to choose from.<br><br>- <strong>Xbox controller support</strong>. Definitely plays best with controllers!<br><br>- <strong>Party mode</strong>. Hate waiting for the end of each round? In party mode you respawn immediately!<br><br>- Many <strong>settings</strong> for your ultimate achtung-on-a-sphere experience!<br><br><br><br>We really hope you like it!<br>Konec hry!",
