    "description": "Keeper 2119 is about the experience of a character that after being completely controlled by a mysterious force, they enter a reality completely different to the known, with the assistance of a technological alien-type device called “Translocator Device” the character must overcome a certain number of challenges to escape using the teleportation provided from the &quot;Translocator Device&quot;, while this mysterious force causes an internal doubt as to what the character believes as reality. Within the game we will be able  to complement the use of teleportation with 3 new sub-mechanics within each game space that will provide a new  gameplay so that the player can progress trougthout the game. The entire game takes place inside a spaceship, therefore each game space is represented by a specific area within the ship.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n*This game demo was developed with the assistance of teachers and developers at Toulouse Lautrec as part of our main career final project team.",
