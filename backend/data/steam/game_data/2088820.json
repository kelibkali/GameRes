However, the academy's benefactor, J Dacilane, has recently heard rumors from his students of seven strange phenomena manifesting on campus. Despite his doubts that these are simply the imaginings of students raised on Pathfinder tales, J has called in a favor with the Pathfinder Society to investigate--both to put his students' minds at ease and for the good learning opportunity a Society report about the school would provide.
