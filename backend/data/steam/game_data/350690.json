    "description": "V16 engines are the largest capacity engine configuration available in Automation, with a capacity range of 1.1L - 21.7L. While it is not giving players any direct advantage, it offers a nuanced alternative to V12 engines for very-high-end cars.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBack before Steam Early Access was a thing, we did sell an early version of Automation via our own website. From 2012 to 2014, potential buyers had the choice between base version ($25), and a premium version ($35) of the game for players who wanted to support development a little extra. The latter promised the inclusion of exclusive V16 engines as soon as they are done. Now, after almost a year of V16 exclusivity for those early premium version buyers, we offer the upgrade to anyone who missed out back then and still wants to support us today.",
