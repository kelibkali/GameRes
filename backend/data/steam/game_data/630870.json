Fruitbat Factory is bringing Chuusotsu! to fans all over the world in dual language (English and Japanese text, characters fully voiced in Japanese).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Story</strong></h2>Under the P3 law enacted under the Global People's Federation, citizens are ranked according to the Authorization Seals issued by the world government. <br><br>As spring arrives, the manga lover Marisugawa Arue, set back by a long-lasting illness, finds herself having to live her life as a &quot;chuusotsu&quot; - a person with no education beyond middle school. <br><br>The chuusotsu are not in possession of any Seals, and are considered to be failures at life. As such, their Authorized Power level is only 5 - young Arue's future is already looking mighty bleak. <br><br><i>&quot;How will I be able to accomplish my goals now...&quot;</i><br><br>In order to break free of her grim situation, and reach her true goal in life, Arue applies for a government relief program where she will... <br><br>Share a room with other chuusotsu!? <br><br>Her two roommates are overwhelmingly unique: a taciturn girl in a souvenir jacket and a crazy chuuni girl. <br><br>And then the three girls are given group challenges to clear. <br><br>What makes a wonderful life? <br><br>Synchronize your minds and philosophize on this proposition. <br><br><i>&quot;There's no way incompetents like us can do philosophy...&quot;</i><br><br>Their time is limited, and failure means that they will immediately get kicked out of the apartment! <br><br>Will Arue manage to successfully complete the philosophical challenges and achieve a happy, steady-going life...!? <br><br>This is a philosophical story of how the three girls considered lame ducks by the society spend their unusual youth in a world where Authorization Seals decide the lives of all people.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Characters</h2></strong><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/630870/extras/054cd54e5606488fffb5adb232378387.avif?t=1743588536\" width=680 height=220 /></span><br><br><strong>Marisugawa Arue</strong> (Voice: Takeda Eruru)<br><br>The protagonist. A manga lover with delicate health.<br><br>Arue’s mental fortitude is also on the weak side, and because of those issues, her academic performance was so poor that she has ended up a chuusotsu (a person with no education beyond middle school).
