We were a two-man team with big dreams and a lack of initial planning. You can still play the somehow-functional version with your friends by hosting the game on your own machine. Your friends can join by clicking on a button next to your name in the main menu.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>About Chunkers</strong></h2>Chunkers is a <strong>casual, multiplayer, voxel-based first-person shooter</strong>. Set during a war on a far-away exoplanet where two sides, a corporation and a cult, fight over a mysterious element. Pick a side and destroy your enemies using a variety of weapons, or use your pickaxe to dig tunnels, build bridges and re-make the entire map to your liking.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574420/extras/9d38c02579e36090a0b675c21c7ca970.avif?t=1670409033\" width=600 height=160 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Control point</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The goal is to capture a deposit of the rare element and hold it for a longer period of time than the enemy team</li><li>Preceeding the main gameplay is a short building phase where the teams are separated by a barrier and can build defenses, start digging tunnels before meeting the enemy team head on</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Team deathmatch</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>No real objective, the teams attack each other and the team with the largest amount of kills wins</li></ul><br>As the game comes closer to release, we're planning on adding a zombies mode as well as many other different gameplay modes.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574420/extras/042b72893d19e81be68ea41bb0123817.avif?t=1670409033\" width=600 height=160 /></span><br>Chunkers was designed to allow for easy map creation and sharing. There are two ways of making a map for Chunkers:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Design the map in-game and save it from the menu</strong>. As a server admin, you can use the 'creative' command to give yourself every block there is and design the map from within the engine. You can also self-host a server and design the map with your friends. And yes, you can save how the map currently looks from any server you're currently connected to as well.</li><li><strong>Use a voxel editor</strong>. Chunkers maps are saved in a voxel format that's usually used for voxel art. Any editor supporting this format can be used to edit the map. To learn more about this, check out our documentation.</li></ul><br>Chunkers also features many interesting blocks that interact with their surroundings. For example:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Lava</strong> gives damage to any player walking over it</li><li><strong>The Piston</strong> bounces the player high into the air when stepped on</li><li><strong>The Explosive</strong> ignites when shot and explodes in a little while after</li></ul>",
