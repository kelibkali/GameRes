Also, &quot;Arizona Derby&quot; is specific since it has realistic off-road terrains, not flatten like in most of the other racing games, so you need to make good decisions, to choose the right ways, to brake on time, and to evade some parts of the roads, to jump at a right angle and to participate incoming off-road paths, with more realism and real off-road experience than other games, but require more skills, it's not almost driving and steering experience, but require training, skills, and devotion at all levels. Mastering different levels, weather conditions and all different off-roads, you will become skilled and able to compete at the higher AI settings and at night races.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/661290/extras/b751a4c3acf310edd34c026ce9c918bc.avif?t=1710446332\" width=686 height=442 /></span><br>One of the unique features is that 'Arizona Derby' has custom created soundtrack, inspired by insane racing styles, created by Houstoun Texas rap musician TxMic, which you can buy as DLC. And for those who prefer other genres, there are 120 licensed upbeat racing tracks for all preferences, from rock, dance, electronic, classical songs to jazz, smooth jazz, instrumentals, etc.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/661290/extras/c0e5849614d18d5c4577fda88f6c160e.avif?t=1710446332\" width=686 height=66 /></span><br>The driving impression is authentic and realistic, at the same time arcade and simulation-like, physics is very complex, featuring tons of high-end algorithms that controlling interactive aspects of vehicles and they are carefully improved over years of research and extended design of &quot;Arizona Derby&quot; to make it utterly fun, and some aspects of the physics may see as arcade and it's intended to be since the game is not a fully accurate off-road simulation, but having most of those aspects since it's an arcade racer. Gameplayhighly recreating the spirit of the real off-road racing experience with that glimpse of arcade racing, to make it more fan and enable players to do more exciting stunts. Ai opponents are ultimately smart, skilled for the off-roads drive, so you need to reach a unique set of skills needed for realistic off-road terrains. You need to take care of how fast and at which angle going over jumps and bumpy roads, sometimes shortcuts ain't the best path to lead the race and you can rollover. Every track, from the current 31 tracks is specific and needs training, a strategy that works on one level is different on another, the same is with an approach to win. Training is most important and over time you can increase the difficulty and achieve more XP/AD$ rewards. You can play dirty and hit out racers aside, and score more as of that, but you will risk they hit you harder and even more intrusive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Check why over 50 curators highly recommending 'Arizona Derby'.</h2><strong>What are players saying?</strong><br><br><i>&quot;The terrain is one of my favorite parts of the game.<br>I grew up in an off-road family &amp; drove my first dune buggy at 10 with just a 50cc engine in a small dunes track area learning the hard way about Speed vs traction, gravel patches, dips, holes, sand, etc. This game brought back those memories forcing me to think the same &amp; now I am hooked on which other off-road games couldn't deliver so Bravo Falcon Interactive.<br>I started playing under the Insane madness difficulty &amp; I absolutely love the AI aggression level it really adds to the fun&quot;.</i><br><br><br><i>&quot;A must-have for anybody interested in motorsport. The game runs well even on my old budget pc. The game allows you to pick from a wide array of cars and tracks and gives you the option to change each car's setup to your liking. Fantastic feeling game. With a good force feedback wheel, the cars feel great and with some adjustment, there is a lot of feedback through the wheel. 95/100&quot;</i><br><br><i>&quot;The graphics and stylized look are actually quite decent. The totally overblown design of the menus? Sure, why not… no issues with that - it's an interesting style choice. 4x4 supercars… great. Cheesy-campish hoists and commentary… yes. This game seems to have sooooo much potential to actually be a cheesy, overblown, stylized, fun racing game… some potential to be an cult classic….&quot;</i><br><br>Note: AMD setups may have optimizations issues as reported by the players with AMD rigs since Unreal Engine didn't work as perfectly as on Intel/Nvidia setups.<br>Sorry for that, but it's impossible to fix these engine issues, optimisations are well addressed through the last 2 years in over hundreds of patches:<br> and achieved dramatic lowering in file sizes from 65GB to 26GB (the game has over 32 tracks, the story plays, almost 100 cars, tons of customizations..), then FPS was more than doubled in previous 2 years, RAM usage cut from 12-16GB to about 2-4GB.<br>It is all high-end content with realistic open worlds and ultimate car shaders and advanced ultra-realistic physics calculations on real off-road (not flatten, textured surfaces), it has even more content than some average AAA games, so please have in mind that graphics requirements are higher as of that.",
