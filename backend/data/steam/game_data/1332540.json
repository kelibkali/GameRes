Dan, the main protagonist, feels as if he was cursed by this being and tries to find a way to bring him down. He will travel alongside a few companions, all with similar stories of loss like his. He never thought actually of having a group or even a family, but he will find something greater than vengeance to fight for: love. In the meantime, while trying to gather the support of every nation of this world, Dan must protect those he love and also himself, not knowing that perhaps this evil instinct may be within... Follow the path of an ordinary man who can overcome extraordinary things.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Order from Caos is strongly inspired by the true JRPG classics.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >+30 hours to finish the whole game with 100% completion.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >+50 quests between the main ones and sidequests </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >+200 NPCs to interact</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >+200 items (weapons, armors and items)</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >+100 skills</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >+100 enemies</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >+10 locations</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >So, fight your way into discovering what it means to live with the curse of CAOS.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1332540/extras/5645084a8c34bf979ec8ae69019cfc4e.avif?t=1738284139\" width=616 height=166 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1332540/extras/29106fe5fd0a86be2306fff7b1a075eb.avif?t=1738284139\" width=145 height=166 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>A </strong>= OK</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>B </strong>= Cancel</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>X</strong> = Shift</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Y </strong>= Menu</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>LB </strong>= Page up</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>RB </strong>= Page down</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>D-pad up</strong> = Up</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>D-pad down </strong>= Down</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>D-pad left </strong>= Left</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>D-pad right </strong>= Right</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1332540/extras/afc013630c1f97ea8767606f55d599d5.avif?t=1738284139\" width=145 height=166 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Tab </strong>= Tab</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Enter </strong>= Ok</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Shift </strong>= Shift</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Control </strong>= Control</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Alt </strong>= Control</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Escape </strong>= Escape</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Space </strong>= Ok</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Page up </strong>= Page up</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Page Down </strong>= Page Down</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Left Arrow </strong>= Left</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Right Arrow </strong>= Right</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Up Arrow</strong> = Up</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Down Arrow </strong>- Down</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Insert </strong>= Escape</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Q </strong>= Page Up</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>W</strong> = Page Down</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>X </strong>= Escape</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Z</strong> = Ok</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1332540/extras/d222598ded7e404bbceb36969816a7be.avif?t=1738284139\" width=616 height=166 /></span>[/img]</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >DAN</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1332540/extras/2cc376901faacd3a1fd2353a5ea9f674.avif?t=1738284139\" width=145 height=166 /></span>Protagonist of the game.
