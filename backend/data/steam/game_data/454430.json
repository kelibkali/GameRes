    "description": "A fast puzzle platformer where the goal is to &quot;optimize&quot; a computer full of redundant parts (who put them there?).<br><br>Taking place within a crammed and hopelessly messy computer, the game follows a good spirit in his fight for restoring balance.<br><br>Includes five polarity based worlds (ten levels each) plus a tutorial. Each room usually has an &quot;optimal&quot; solution but there are multiple solutions to each puzzle. Upon beating the last room in each level, the next world unlocks. The progress is saved automatically.<br><br>Controls (ingame):<br>Joypad is autodetected.<br>Keyboard (customizable): cursor keys to move, &quot;X&quot; to select / jump, &quot;space&quot; for &quot;Start&quot;.<br><br>Controls (system):<br>Esc to exit game.<br>Tab+Space resets the game to opening.<br>F4 to switch between windowed / fullscreen.<br>Redefine the controls in the windowed mode (menu &quot;Settings&quot;).<br><br>Please see about.txt for additional information.<br><br>This game requires DirectX9.0c (Windows 10 usually has it). In case it is not already installed, it can be obtained from the Microsoft page:<br><br>more info here:<br>",
