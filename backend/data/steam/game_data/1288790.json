Digital Fusion Inc., my development company, brought you the hugely successful BH2K game series on both PCs and in arcades worldwide. With a background in comics and a natural inclination for storytelling, I embarked on the journey of crafting BeachHead, originally conceived as a world. However, during that era, the simplicity of games and the constraints of arcade technology limited its potential.<br><br>The new iteration of BeachHead has transcended those limitations. It's not just a one-shot deal; it's a fully immersive VR game and a living experience within an expansive, ever-growing game world. This world exists in a parallel dimension to our own, complete with a social structure and economy—essentially, an RPG-like turret defense shooter. While our initial plan during the early access period was to develop the full game and its features, including the vast scope of the BeachHead world, including BH City, we decided to embrace a progressive implementation approach toward achieving the complete BeachHead World experience—one battle at a time. We believe this approach will allow us to gradually unveil the richness and depth of the BeachHead universe, ensuring a captivating and thoroughly developed gaming experience for our players.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >GAME MODES</h2><br><strong>BH Battles</strong><br><br>Beachhead Battles aims to bring new environments and scenarios to the world of BeachHead. Every battle is unique and will feature new defense positions and weapon turrets to defend against smarter and progressively more difficult new enemy troops and weapons.

The level editor interface is very graphical and quite easy to use, and you can test the levels and battles as you program them. The idea is that users will be able to publish their battles for others to play and vice versa and for the battles to be rated to be included into the official game.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1288790/extras/07b227b05fb0013302848a574858f9c2.avif?t=1714691709\" width=616 height=288 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >MAIN FEATURES</h2><br>BH Graphics<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Graphics Enhancements</strong>: Significant improvements in graphics and lighting create a more immersive and true-to-life experience.
