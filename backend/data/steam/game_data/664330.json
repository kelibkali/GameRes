    "description": "Requires Trainz Route: Niddertalbahn (Free)<br><br>If you get hot and cold sensations running through you even without having flu, then perhaps it’s already the case that you’re the proud owner of our Shmmns coil wagon. Because whether red hot or ice cold, you can transport hot or cold-rolled steel from the rolling mills to industrial sites with this spectacular technological marvel. Introduced in 2016, the wagon has state-of -the-art technology as well as the highest possible transport performance: fitted with “whisper brakes”, it ensures minimum noise emissions.<br><br>When designing this coil wagon, we attached great importance to keeping its modern look, while at the same time also showing signs of wear. Detailed labelling and a suitable “winter outfit” round off the overall impression. We have thus once again optimised the well-known “winter clothing” of previous wagons: an even more realistic look is now ensured by elaborately produced icicles and piles of snow.<br><br>Different cargoes can be shown, as the fancy takes you. A realistic wagon sound, animated brakes (with icicles!) and the tail panel are the final touches to round off this unique wagon.<br> <br>Two sessions for the free route &quot;Niddertalbahn&quot; are included in this package. Get on board and extend your vehicle fleet with this highly detailed wagon.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Shmmns-Coilwagon, high resolution<br></li><li>Coilsize 800mm, 1400mm, 1800mm und 2200mm can be selected<br></li><li>All wagons can be loaded individually<br></li><li>Empty wagon usable (different weights)<br></li><li>Animated brakes<br></li><li>Wagon recognizes if it is loaded or empty and changes small details on it’s own<br></li><li>Highly detailed car models and sophisticated lettering including more than 100 selectable UIC<br></li><li>Realistic sound<br></li><li>Winter support including icicles (visible in January and February)<br></li><li>Different coil types with different specularity can be chosen<br></li><li>Two sessions for Niddertalbahn ( free route )<br></li><li>Visible European UIC coupling<br></li><li>Taillights<br></li><li>Trainz industry support</li></ul>",
