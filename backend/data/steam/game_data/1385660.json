    "description": "Are you sitting at home, browsing your video game library not sure what to play? Well now you can get that same rush of apathy that you've been craving while also letting your friends know you're bored and don't know what to do about it!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVideo Game Library Simulator is a simulation of a video game digital library. You can browse the store, make purchases, and play around with them before deciding that looking through your library was the more interesting part of the experience. If you're the type of person who wastes time just browsing your library anyway, why not do the same thing but in a game?",
