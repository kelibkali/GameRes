    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Scramble: Battle of Britain</strong> is a tactical dogfighting game that thrusts players into the High-Octane chaos of the 1940 summer skies. Set in a dynamic 3D airspace, this simultaneous-turn-based game embraces the intricate details of aerodynamics and physics-based simulation unique to the piloting experience while minimizing time and reflex demands. Players lead their squadrons through intense aerial battles as Luftwaffe and RAF fighters clash over the English Channel. Through each gameplay phase—Planning, Simulation, and Review—players strategize and command aerial maneuvers, witness simulation outcomes in real-time, and rewind the action to analyze battle damage using detailed camera tools.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1530450/extras/17c153501791ee5429e37f1743c6ee49.poster.avif?t=1770212709\" width=1170 height=658 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1530450/extras/17c153501791ee5429e37f1743c6ee49.webm?t=1770212709\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1530450/extras/17c153501791ee5429e37f1743c6ee49.mp4?t=1770212709\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Turn-based Tactical Dogfighting</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Scramble: Battle of Britain breaks the chaos of a dogfight into short, thrilling chunks of action. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Explore the heart-pounding tactical space of a dogfight within a digestible turn-based environment.

Squadron pilots will have unique identities and each pilot will have a collection of traits characterizing their strengths and weaknesses in combat. Pilots will tire, injure, and die throughout the battle, and as leader you must balance the health and well being of your squadron with your total attrition rate. Squadron Leader is the proving ground for current and future mechanics that will form the foundation of the full Channel Defense Campaign.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Dogfight Generator pitches you straight into the action, letting you design and jump into missions instantly, choosing to fight for either the RAF or the Luftwaffe in furballs of up to twelve aircraft. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >With saveable match replays and cinematic tools that allow you to capture the action from every angle, you can relive and share your greatest victories.
