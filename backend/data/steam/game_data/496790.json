If you are in possession of the ball, you can throw it down the court to move. You’ll automatically teleport and rotate to face the ball so that you can catch it. Beware though! A savvy enough opponent can teleport in front of you to snag the ball. To keep the game moving at a fast pace, you can only hold the ball for up to two consecutive seconds. If you’re running out of power, consider dribbling the ball while you decide your next move. <br><br>Speed-Ball is only available in in online multiplayer with 2 players.<br><br>Note: This mode has been highly immersive in our play tests.

In Team Speed-Ball, you and one other friend will pair up to compete against another team. First team to score 20 points wins! There's no traveling down the court when holding the ball, so you'll need to quickly and strategically plan your moves with your teammate.<br><br>Team Speed-Ball is only available in online multiplayer with 4 players.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Knockout</h2>Complete against your friends to see who can make a shot the quickest, or risk being eliminated! <br><br>In Knockout, each player will line up at the free throw line. The first player in line will have one chance to make a basket. If they miss, the second player in line will begin shooting. The goal is to score a basket before the other player does! If the first player in line scores, they are safe and move to the back of the line. However, if the second player in line scores, the first player is eliminated. Each round begins the same, with new players in the first and second positions.

If made, everyone else will need to take the exact same shot. Anyone who misses the shot will gain a letter. Once they gain all letters for the word, they will be eliminated. The last player standing wins! Offline games are played against Kevin, who has varying difficulties. <br><br>H-O-R-S-E can be played single player against Kevin or online with 2-4 players.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Rapid Fire</h2>Rapid Fire tests your ability to shoot without having much time to aim your shot. <br><br>Score as many points possible in the time given. Shoot fast or your ball will disappear! You can either challenge your friends in real time or play by yourself and see how you rank against the global leaderboards.<br><br>Rapid Fire can be played single player or online with 2-4 players.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Mix-Up and Power Shot</h2>Both Mix-Up and Power Shot will have you rapidly teleporting around the entire gymnasium while you try to make shots as quickly as possible.
