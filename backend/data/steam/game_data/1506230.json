    "description": "Bigfoot Forest - a first-person indie horror game. While traveling in your car, you run out of gas and find yourself far away from any civilized locations at night, with only woods and a small town nearby. A very dangerous creature, described as similar to a yeti, is said to live there, and it wouldn’t welcome any unbidden guests. Your objective is to kill the creature to be able to continue your journey, and to avoid becoming a victim yourself. Luckily, you’ve got a gun.",
