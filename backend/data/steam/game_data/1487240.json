Fight your way through five bandit fortresses, collect weapons and treasure to increase your power, and take on the bandit leaders! With randomly generated: levels, enemies, and loot. Every playthrough will provide it's own unique challenges and opportunities. No two post-apocalyptic adventures will be the same. The journey will be a dangerous one but don't worry, defeat is simply a bad dream. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Story</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Many years after the big one, the event that ended the world. Society rebuilt the best they could, and as such welcome to the new old-west. Take on the role of a lone cowpoke arriving at a small town in the post-apocalyptic frontier. Unfortunately for you and the local citizens, a group of despicable bandits control the surrounding area. The Mayor seeks your help in dealing with these villains, so with nothing but your trusty old revolver and wits you set out to be a cowpoke of legends in this lawless land.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Devious Bandits and their Bosses</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Local ruffians, led by the nefarious Baron Von Bandit, have taken over the countryside murdering and robbing anyone they come across.
