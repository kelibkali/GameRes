    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Synopsis</h2>It is rumored that there are several proofs of friendship between humans and monsters.<br>What is it like?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Let's capture the dungeon with many gimmicks</h2>The player controls the human race “Ryuto” and seeks deep inside the dungeon to find proof of friendship.<br>Various gimmicks are set in the dungeon, making it difficult to reach the back. A wide variety of gimmicks are blocking intruders, such as high steps out of reach, narrow airborne scaffolding, strong waterways, dark rooms with no light, and things like that. There will be gimmicks that cannot be captured by Ryuto alone. In such a case, you can call the monster girl with &quot;Monster Girl Action&quot; to help with the gimmick strategy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Call the monster girl with &quot;Monster Girl Action'&quot;</h2>Like humans, not humans ... Monster girls have their own unique characteristics. A slime girl has a viscous body, a harpy can fly with her winged arms, and a centaur can run as fast as a horse.<br>Those features will help the dungeon strategy. If you have a trampoline-shaped slime girl jump up, you can go over a high step, and if you carry it to a harpy that can fly in the sky, it does not matter if you have a huge hole that cannot be seen at the bottom.<br>Call the appropriate monster girl for the gimmick.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Let's talk to characters</h2>The dungeon is not just a charter. Some characters are also interested in dungeon strategy.<br>If you meet such a character on the way, let's talk without being shy. There may be a lot of public talk, but it may give you an unexpected hint of dungeon strategy.<br>There are no worries about being attacked by the monster girl so far, so let's talk actively.",
