Bannermen features 15 unique units (characters) available to recruit when your base meets certain requirements.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >GAMEMODES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Singleplayer Campaign; take on the role of the fallen Lord Berrian in his quest to save Valtoria and become one of the mightiest in the realm.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >AI Skirmish; battle it out with an AI and fight for humanity.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >STORY &amp; CAMPAIGN</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Having suffered a crushing defeat in the Battle of Beckron, you, Lord Berrian must now regain former bannermen that have surrendered to Lord Karthor. The days of chasing glory are over, as terror spreads and forces ever greater sacrifices to hold Lord Karthor’s men at bay. Without a home and much time to spare, you must travel the vast lands of Valtoria to obtain supplies and convert soldiers to your righteous cause.<br>Bannermen features a full-length singleplayer campaign that lets you dive into the realm of Valtoria as its upcoming hero. Command troops, free prisoners, infiltrate strongholds, manage resources and construct buildings in order to achieve victory in the great war. Learn to fight in many vastly different environments; use sandstorms to hide your advance, set up traps against incoming attacks or why not blow up your enemies with an explosive barrel? With creativity, you must use your surroundings to gain an advantage.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >GAMEPLAY</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Take manual control over each unit and use its abilities wisely. To become a successful commander, you need to manage your resources well and construct new bases when the timing is right. The balance between economy and army as well as transitioning to more advanced units when it is possible is a big part of the strategic depth in Bannermen. But there are also unique mechanics, like the Temples which you can build to gain Nature Powers. These powers can have devastating effects on your enemies and varies for each map as well as their available building locations. After a Temple has been erected your enemies will be notified and a publicly visible timer begins that counts down to when it is available. <br>In an AI skirmish, you can choose to recruit one out of three heroes (Lord Berrian, Lord Karthor or Lady Vanya) that can be levelled up throughout the match to become more powerful. Levels are gained by killing neutral creeps, or by defeating enemy units.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/699740/extras/3b51e20efd8987a799ebbd0949ae4753.poster.avif?t=1759937712\" width=680 height=382 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/699740/extras/3b51e20efd8987a799ebbd0949ae4753.webm?t=1759937712\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/699740/extras/3b51e20efd8987a799ebbd0949ae4753.mp4?t=1759937712\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p>",
