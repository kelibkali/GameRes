    "description": "<strong>Last Blossom</strong> it's a short game scene, based on one well-known tabletop roleplaying game. I tried to reproduce the game rules with some accuracy, so it contains, if I may say, only a few &quot;home rules&quot;. So this scene may help to understand some of the basic rules of roleplaying tabletop games.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1604690/extras/4785821c26fb97099f4f066e3f31f5c5.avif?t=1621545016\" width=632 height=446 /></span><br><br> If you are a lonely adventurer that standing on a crossroad with grey, boring and empty life on one way and creative, unbelievable and full of discoveries life of a roleplayer in another hand - i hope Last Blossom will help you to choose the right road.<br> And if you will not be quite inspired about all of this - just be sure that real roleplaying games with the right people are way better, so please don't give up!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1604690/extras/f47f0485d955d8dc589b929ac30e25d5.avif?t=1621545016\" width=632 height=192 /></span><br><br> This scene is pretty short, so if you don't want to have more spoilers - you may consider just to try it first. But if you need a features list, well...<br><strong>Features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Dice rolls - cruel but honest random and its deadly consequences!<br></li><li>Tense conversation<br></li><li>Turn-based battle<br></li><li>3 playable characters<br></li><li>Different ways to achieve the goal<br></li><li>Fantasy adventure atmosphere, made of Low poly, patchy animation, 8-bit sounds, and Unreal Engine 4 features</li></ul><br>I tried to put in this scene more or less full tutorial and <strong>detailed &quot;Help&quot;</strong> section, so if you are a beginner in this kind of genre, or maybe you not quite often playing in videogames at all - you still have a chance to figure out how it works.<br> If you will have some trouble in understanding of what's happening in the game, or what you need to do - i would be grateful if you let me know about you're problem.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1604690/extras/bc1d8118a6a458800b8a08cc9d32d492.avif?t=1621545016\" width=632 height=400 /></span><br><br> OGL notice:<br> This game contains some of the Open Game Content that  used under and in terms of Open Gaming License Version 1.0a.",
