    "description": "1890, Santiago, Chile. A powerful warlock has fallen into a deep sleep. His nightmares are becoming real, and his monsters now emanate from an abyss into the world above. It will take a special warrior to enter the abyss, and a special composer to score that journey. Patricio Meneses is that composer. A veteran that's worked with developer ACE Team on each of their games (Zeno Clash, Zeno Clash II, and Rock of Ages), he offers yet another mesmerizing musical score, amplifying the dangerous and spectacular world below the surface. This soundtrack includes 27 tracks comprising more than 60 minutes of music.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Track List</h2><br>01 - Opening<br>02 - The Abyss' Theme<br>03 - Return to the Abyss<br>04 - The Awakening<br>05 - Prologue<br>06 - Santa Lucia<br>07 - The Descent Begins<br>08 - The Cavern<br>09 - Evil Nearby<br>10 - The Spirit<br>11 - Pincoya's Well<br>12 - Pocuro Plaza<br>13 - Underground Rainforest<br>14 - Into the Wild<br>15 - Witch's Child<br>16 - Sacramentinos<br>17 - Frozen Caves<br>18 - Crystal Adventure<br>19 - The Phantom Zone<br>20 - Verbum Dei<br>21 - Living Creature<br>22 - The Abyss' Dark Theme<br>23 - Grim Descent<br>24 - Final Confrontation<br>25 - The Ascent<br>26 - Training Room<br>27 - Credits",
