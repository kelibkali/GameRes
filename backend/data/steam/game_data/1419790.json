    "description": "Pro Trainz®: TEE Rheingold<br><br>The introduction of the Trans Europe Express (TEE) set completely new benchmarks for travels within the European Economic Area. This new train type was distinguished by numerous exclusive special features, such as First Class, a galley, customs areas and more. The most striking of all, however, was the train's uniform painting in wine-red and beige.<br> <br>Even the then newly produced Rheingold received this enhancement so that the cobalt blue flagship got its world-famous wine-red livery within a short period of time.<br> <br>In order to complete the Rheingold series and by popular request, we have now developed this train: the Rheingold 'Trans Europe Express' TEE.<br> <br>As with the earlier Rheingold 1962 add-on, we have designed all coaches in detail, replaced the old paint scheme and labelled them precisely.
