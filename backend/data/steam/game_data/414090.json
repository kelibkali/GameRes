    "description": "<strong>“The Warden”</strong> is a first-person psychological-horror game with puzzles .<br>Ephram Elias Barkley is a landowner who , after losing his family , lives his life in a alcoholic loneliness .<br>His life is interspersed with moments of lucidity and states of trance that seem to leave, as  only trace, mysterious drawings of dark landscapes in which stands a big figure with deers horns…<br><br><br><i> &quot;Was always the same picture... a landscape with a river and a forest. The only difference was that the black figure seemed to be getting closer.<br>Each time it was as if it had been drawed closer. Its outlines became lighter, and I glimpsed some horns, that I thought looked like deer's horns, on its head... <br>From then on my memories fade and my mind starts to waver.&quot; </i><br><br><br><br><u>Black Mist Studios Developer Team.</u>",
