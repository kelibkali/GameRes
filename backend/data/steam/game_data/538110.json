It tells the story of a small sea creature named Delila and her struggle to understand belonging, ownership, fear, othering, and the darkness surrounding her.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy using Tilt Brush and using these paintings to create a particle simulation, Delila's Gift lets the users literally *step* into the paintings, playing and pulling on them in an inherently physical fashion.",
