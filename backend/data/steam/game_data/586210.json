    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >OVRdrop is a Utility Application for SteamVR that can mirror a Desktop Window, an entire Monitor, or a WebCam into a Cross Game SteamVR Overlay. OVRdrop works on SteamVR and should be fully compatible with any SteamVR headset, though you will need tracked controllers for many of the features. It is known to work for the HTC Vive as well as the Oculus Rift, though <strong>some games may not be compatible with the Rift</strong>. The only major downside is that Cross Game Overlays will always draw on top of game geometry because Depth information is not fed to the Compositor by SteamVR games.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >If you have any issues getting started, be sure to check the FAQ on our GitHub which I'll try to keep updated with the most common questions.

However some games will override the SteamVR SDK when using an Oculus Rift or an OSVR HMD, and prevent SteamVR from drawing to the headset. <strong>In this case, OVRdrop will not work with those games.</strong> Please check our Compatibility guide on our GitHub for more information. Please report Oculus Rift/OSVR success or failure on our GitHub Issue Tracker.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Certain Oculus Rift games can be fixed and made to work with SteamVR/OVRdrop!
