    "description": "<strong> First of two adventures included in the Keeper's Screen for Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition.</strong><br>In Blackwater Creek, three or more investigators travel to the rural town of Cade's Rest to investigate the disappearance of an archaeological professor from Miskatonic University, only to discover that something sinister is taking over both the town and the wilderness.<br>In Blackwater Creek, two alternate introductions are provided to entice investigators into the town; that of associates of the university, and as criminal bootleggers. The module is suitable for new or seasoned investigators but is weighted towards new groups.<br>This module has been streamlined for easy play in Fantasy Grounds, including all Story elements, NPCs, Creatures, Images, and Maps.<br>Blackwater Creek is the first converted module from the Keeper's Screen for use with Fantasy Grounds. Missed Dues will be converted in the future, and sold separately. Each module is a stand-alone module.<br>By Mike Mason, Scott Dorward, and Paul Fricker. Screen art by Ardila; scenario art by Pat Loboyko, Chris Huth, and Chris Lackey.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Brian Hill</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Call of Cthulhu 7E ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
