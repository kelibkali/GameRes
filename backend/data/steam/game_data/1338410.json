However, the Emperor of the Elves and the most vile of his vassals managed to outwit you: your army was weakened, your brother was killed, and you managed to escape only by a miracle, after a fierce battle for the capital. Many years have passed, and finally you have the opportunity to return what is yours by right, recapture every fortress of western Kiltmer and end the rule of the cunning elves!<br><br>Having examined the sketch of the fortress walls from your scouts, having analyzed the enemy's defenses, you lined up your army in the correct formation, putting each troop in its place. All troops have special abilities and their own specialization. It is necessary to correctly combine units with their abilities to overcome the enemy's defense.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1338410/extras/8dc6de50530e9fc7fcbc552744d41214.poster.avif?t=1603459228\" width=616 height=346 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1338410/extras/8dc6de50530e9fc7fcbc552744d41214.webm?t=1603459228\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1338410/extras/8dc6de50530e9fc7fcbc552744d41214.mp4?t=1603459228\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>However, it doesn't end there! You have to personally lead the assault, opening up the potential of each troop on each of the five attacking lines simultaneously.

You are free to choose the troops and their formation by yourself. To line up a turtle bristling with shields so that no enemy arrow reaches the target, or opposite, to shower the defenders with heavy fire of their own arrows, so that they are afraid to even look towards your impending army - the choice is yours! Most importantly, do not forget that to counter the enemy's defenses on each of the attacking lines, you need to select the appropriate units in your own army.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1338410/extras/749c43ff75cf64359c782c2460f3ceba.avif?t=1603459228\" width=612 height=72 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Para Bellum is characterized by high dynamics of what is happening, any mistake or delay can cost you dearly.<br><br></li><li>You will need to collect a unique army, to successfully complete the level.
