    "description": "<i>Why blow up an enemy vehicle when you can steal it? <br>Why stay in 1 vehicle when you can pilot a small fleet?</i><br><br>Hijack Overdrive is a fast-paced action game where you steal enemy vehicles mid-combat to fight back. You'll have to jump from vehicle to vehicle in order to pilot your self-acquired-fleet through the enemy forces. <br>It's a unique genre-mix of Platformer, Shootemup, and a bit of Towerdefense. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1594160/extras/hijackscene4.gif?t=1734360650\" /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Demo Features</h2>The demo showcases the main gameplay concept by providing a tutorial and 3 missions for you to tackle, and takes about 15 minutes to complete. <br>The garage and related features are currently absent in this demo.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Full Game Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Innovative new game concept<br></li><li>3+ hours of action-heavy gameplay<br></li><li>20 different vehicle-types to acquire<br></li><li>Bring acquired vehicles to the garage to dismantle them or built new ones, and take them to other missions<br></li><li>Grow your own personal fleet to lead assaults into the monster realm!<br></li><li>Defeat big boss-monsters<br></li><li>Unique scoring system by breakdancing on vehicles</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1594160/extras/story.png?t=1734360650\" /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story</h2>You’re part of a small resistance fighting against a tyrant set on world domination. His quest for power has led him to look beyond our world in search of the elusive monster-realm and the power it contains. <br>He must be stopped before it is too late, but his forces vastly outnumber the resistance's. In a last effort, &quot;operation Hijack Overdrive&quot; has been set in motion.<br>Now all hope rests on your shoulders, as you’ve been trained and equipped to turn the enemies’ numbers against them!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1594160/extras/gameplay.png?t=1734360650\" /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay</h2>At it's core Hijack Overdrive is a side-scrolling platformer. Staying in 1 vehicle will often mean the death of you, so you’re constantly on the move, stealing different vehicles, creating a small fleet on the fly, all while dodging enemy fire. <br>Depending on what you decide to do, a vehicle can be an enemy, an ally, a platform, or a shield.<br>You decide how you want to tackle each situation, but you’ll have to think fast.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1594160/extras/garage2.png?t=1734360650\" /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Garage</h2>You’re stationed in a base near the front line, from there you will start each mission. <br>After completing a mission, the vehicles you acquired get added to the garage in your base. <br>You can use any vehicle from your base to start a mission with, and even summon one when in a pickle. <br>There’s also a unique challenge for each vehicle type in your garage, so try to collect them all! <br>Grow your own personal fleet and use them on special missions where you’ll need every last one of them! <br>You can redo missions at any time to get more vehicles in your garage. (and get the ones you missed)<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1594160/extras/breakdanceSmall3.gif?t=1734360650\" /></span>",
