Run, jump, hang, climb, roll, and shoot your way through mysterious alien ruins, a flying penitentiary, a high-tech megalopolis, and a majestic forest.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1528500/extras/e06b3f9aeb6c6c47dafda883d829a8da.poster.avif?t=1697049490\" width=616 height=616 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1528500/extras/e06b3f9aeb6c6c47dafda883d829a8da.webm?t=1697049490\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1528500/extras/e06b3f9aeb6c6c47dafda883d829a8da.mp4?t=1697049490\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>As Earth became inhospitable, Noah, an AI whose sole purpose was to preserve humanity, was created. Noah chose the Moon as humanity's Ark - renamed Lunark - using it as a ship to evacuate a handful of chosen ones to the nearest superhabitable planet. Unfortunately, whether the planet was inhabited or not wasn't part of Noah’s programming.<br><br>Centuries later, you play as Leo, an orphan rejected for being… different. You'll retrace your origins in the midst of a rebellion against the totalitarian regime of Lunark, and meet a wide cast of colorful characters, stuck on either side of the escalating conflict. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1528500/extras/ed9f671c2e16bdd0ba7cf9a0b532615c.webp?t=1697049490\"><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1528500/extras/ed9f671c2e16bdd0ba7cf9a0b532615c.poster.avif?t=1697049490\" class=\"bb_img\" width=616 height=112 /></picture></span><br><br>I've designed Lunark as a homage to cinematic platformers while bringing modernity to a lot of the core aspects: The controls are responsive and intuitive and the progression system generous. The game is meant to feel fresh while being nostalgic. Lunark is also an adventure focused on delivering a thrilling narrative with explosive moments.<br><br><br><strong>THE GENRE</strong><br><br>You have no idea what a 2D cinematic platformer is?<br>“Cinematic platformers are action-adventure platformers with a strong emphasis on realism, cinematic presentation, detailed character animations, [...] and a minimalistic approach to storytelling”.
