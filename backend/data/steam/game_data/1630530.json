    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Four years have passed</strong>, and looking back, <i>Universe999999</i> has always been closer to a personal experiment than a conventional game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >I started with an ambitious idea: to simulate the universe from a Big Bang, letting the four fundamental forces define everything that followed. Matter, energy, stars, and structures were meant to emerge on their own, guided only by underlying rules. During that period, I was deeply focused on one thing—whether the theory could be recreated, whether the system <i>made sense</i>.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >For a long time, I convinced myself that this was enough. Watching a universe slowly take shape felt meaningful. But eventually, a quiet discomfort set in. There was beauty in the simulation, yet there was distance. Players weren’t shaping the universe—they were waiting for it. Observing instead of deciding. Understanding instead of acting.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >That discomfort led to a difficult question I couldn’t avoid anymore: <i>Was I trying to simulate a universe, or was I trying to make a game?</i><br>No matter how intricate a system is, if it doesn’t allow players to feel present—if it doesn’t let their choices matter—then something essential is missing.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Admitting that wasn’t easy. It meant accepting that years of work, while not wasted, weren’t pointing in the right direction as a game. But it also opened a new path forward.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The direction began to change. I kept the ideas of cosmic formation and structural evolution, but moved them beneath the surface. What came forward instead were decisions, trade-offs, management, and expansion. The universe stopped being something that merely <i>happens</i>—it became something that asks something of the player. Responsibility, involvement, and consequence became part of the design, along with a few philosophical questions I still don’t have clear answers to.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The current version of <i>Universe999999</i> is undeniably different from what I first imagined. Yet for the first time, it feels like it’s asking the right questions: <i>Is this engaging? Is this meaningful? What does the player take away after playing?</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This update is only a moment along a much longer path. It includes early in-development visuals, and many systems are still evolving. To everyone who believed in this project early on and chose to support it—thank you for giving me the time and space to find what this universe was truly meant to become.</p>",
