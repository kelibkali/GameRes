    "description": "At Spearhead Games, we believe that e-sports are the next step in international competition. We believe that this growing trend is on the verge of becoming mainstream globally and will play a significant role in defining the future of sports.<br><br>Arena: Cyber Evolution is the result of our passion for this phenomenon and what it can become.  <br>We know that creating a game that is significant and meaningful on the e-sport scene is no small task and this is why that we have involved the player community since the very beginning of the development, when there were no menus, options, or even textures! <br><br><br>Arena: Cyber Evolution (ACE) is a futuristic physics-based sports game in which players confront each other in 3 vs 3 matches of wits and twitch reflexes.<br>By featuring a MOBA-like champion logic, ACE brings an unprecedented twist to the sports genre by allowing players to choose from a variety of super-powered heroes and what style of gameplay they prefer to build their own team strategies.<br><br>Designed from the ground up around the mouse &amp; keyboard, ACE was not envisioned only as a sport game, but really as a new sport. <br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/285580/extras/Innovative.JPG?t=1539975727\" /></span><br>ACE’s ultra-precise control scheme allows players to analogically manipulate the disk using simple mouse gestures.<br><br>Just like in real sports, this gameplay allows for super intuitive gameplay while proposing nearly infinite depth &amp; skill cap.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/285580/extras/Keyfeatures.JPG?t=1539975727\" /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>An unique blend of action games, sports games and MOBA.<br></li><li>The closest experience to playing a traditional sport in a video game.<br></li><li>Dynamic physics-based gameplay that is both deep and accessible.<br></li><li>Innovative mouse gesture control allows for fluid and natural actions (passes, shots, intercepts and jukes).<br></li><li>Having all human players makes positioning meaningful and allow for infinite team strategies.<br></li><li>Several characters each with unique powers and play styles<br></li><li>Unlock implants (to improve and customize your characters), team boosts, upgrades, and special abilities.<br></li><li>Very fun to watch as a spectator - even without prior knowledge of the game.<br></li><li>New characters, implants, custom arenas, events, challenges, and much more coming soon! New updates regularly!</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/285580/extras/ac1d5232d1f7a995f94b590fc78fe68e.avif?t=1539975727\" width=600 height=308 /></span><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/285580/extras/d48f23ccd428289a9dca5c5c7094605d.avif?t=1539975727\" width=600 height=76 /></span><br><br>Arena: Cyber Evolution is free to play and we want it to stay this way forever. We believe that it should be at the core of any sport to be accessible for everyone to play and practice no matter what.<br>As an independent game studio, we however need some money to keep developing the game and improving it.  <br><br>This is why we integrated monetization features in the game with the possibility to buy skins, hats and other customizations with real money (but never pay to win mechanics!).  For us, this is a simple way to allow players who really enjoy and believe in the game to support its continued development by ‘’donating’’ and receiving rewards for it.<br><br>In addition to the items available in-game, the following great packages are available as DLC:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Supporters Pack DLC</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Founders Pack DLC</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/285580/extras/FoundersPack_EX.JPG?t=1539975727\" /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Champions Pack DLC</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/285580/extras/ChampionPack.JPG?t=1539975727\" /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Pillar Pack DLC</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >More</h2>For more opportunities to support us, please visite our web page!",
