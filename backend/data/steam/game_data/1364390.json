The three people currently building Animaze have been pioneers in this space, and have been in service of this community for a very long time. Whether working on FaceRig or Animaze, the tech built by us and our former colleagues since 2014 has brought to life and inspired many features used across the VTubing world in many apps today. <br><br>A recent example is Multiplayer Rooms with high-quality full-body motion and filming camera controls, for avatar concerts. This is a feature that many VTubers still think does not yet exist for free anywhere in the world, (not even on apps powered by corporate engines), when it has been available here, on the free tier, starting with March 2023. <br><br>Aside from FaceRig, Animaze remains, as far as we know,  the only indie-engine VTubing app worldwide that propelled some of its users who were using the included stock avatars, to millions of followers. Whether we are talking about Obit or MagLobao on YouTube, or PuffPuff on TikTok, we are proud of opening this path in a truly independent fashion, without the help of any large commercial game engine, and organically with no marketing help from talent management agencies. <br><br>If you are a long-time supporter, thank you!<br>If you are finding us now for the first time, we hope you will join us on this ride.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364390/extras/e887977f4546063819cb7c6764232d73.avif?t=1760624465\" width=600 height=263 /></span>",
