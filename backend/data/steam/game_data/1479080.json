The deep sea needs your help pulling Mother Ocean from her depression spiral for the water ritual to be complete. You must collect and deliver life energy pearls to the Nucleoid Portal to awaken her. You’ll receive mysterious messages, learn how to astral project and meditate with consciousness warriors as you navigate a fantastic deep sea world full of weird, alien underwater creatures. Will you be around long enough to experience universal oneness? </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Astrologically, on December 21, 2020 a great cosmic conjunction will occur: the two largest planetary bodies in our solar system, Saturn and Jupiter, line up in the same sign at the same degree. This event, which astrologers call The Great Conjunction, happens every twenty years—but 2020's event is extra special since Jupiter and Saturn haven't been this close since 1623! We hope this piece of art, released on and about this alignment, helps us all prepare to receive the blessings of change, unity and evolution.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Features</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Conquer gravity with a unique movement system as you navigate a fantastic deep sea galaxy full of alien species.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Receive mysterious messages and entertain dialogues with your future self.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Learn how to astral project and become comfortable with out-of-body experiences.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Bring the worlds to life as you solve puzzles that open pathways between long lost planets.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Credits</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Concept and art direction | Paloma Dawkins @Palomadawkins </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Programming and game design | Kas Ghobadi @theStaticMan </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Narrative and writing | Ashley Obscura @hologramrainbow </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Promotional manager | Camille Verreault @CamilleVerreau1</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Sound Effects | Margo</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Music |  :3lON, Margo, Caila Thompson-Hannat, Devon Hansen</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Special thanks to | Ruben Farrus, Flan, Sean Lee, Laura Hirsh, Ken Perlin, Marie Foulston, Aya Avalon, Cody Walker, Kyler Kelly, Michael Johnson, Zach Xavier, Clement Shimizu, BabyCastles </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >With support from | Canada Council for the Arts, Victoria and Albert Museum</p>",
