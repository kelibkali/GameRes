    "description": "Have you wondered what it's like to be a brave monk in Middle Ages' China? In this game you can become one, and you have to defend yourself from the incoming<br />\r\nclay soldiers. Take your bow and arrow and shoot as many enemies as possible. The astonishing view and landscape is breath-taking even at first glance so that the player gets emerged immediately into the world of Middle Ages. You can also move and explore the map freely. The game gets increasingly harder with more and more enemies attacking you.",
