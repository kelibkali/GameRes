IT <strong>IS</strong> ALSO KNOWN AS THE SEWAGE SYSTEM! ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING AND UNKNOWN PLACES OF THE CITY. DON’T WORRY, IT ISN’T <strong>DANGEROUS</strong>. <strong>AND</strong> IT MAY SMELL DOWN THERE A BIT BUT IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF THE WASTE FROM OUR <strong>BODIES</strong> AND OTHER STUFF OF THE SORT. THERE <strong>ARE</strong> SOMETIMES RODENTS <strong>KEPT DOWN THERE.</strong> THERE CAN EVEN BE <strong>FISH</strong> IN THE SEWERS. AND REMEMBER THERE <strong>IS</strong> NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF.

Don't lose sight of the walls around you, and never forget why you left the world above. You are armed with a cheap flashlight and a pair of legs that don't like to run for too long. As quiet as the sewage system could get, you must remember that you aren't alone and have never been before.",
