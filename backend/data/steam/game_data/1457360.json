    "description": "A feudal era turn-based tactics game. Explore a procedurally generated open world set in a dark fantasy realm. Interact with the world and its inhabitants in order to survive. Defeat your adversaries via intense turn-based tactical combat. Unravel the grand conspiracy that threatens humanity!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBegin your adventure somewhere on a massive island continent filled with a variety of landscapes, biomes, settlements and ever-present threats. The rulers of this land are imposing a strict class system to govern society. Due to your mysterious origin you have no place among these upper classes and thus become a member of the lowest class; the underbelly of society; The Outcaste. Gain the trust of your fellow Outcaste and invite others to join your party as you venture out on your journey to unfold a devious conspiracy. As your party's strength grows so too will your team's inventory of weapons, armor, supplies and other resources. Equip your personnel with deadly gear and decide how their abilities develop as they level up. Manage a vast amount of main and side missions using your log and the world map. Kick back for some R&amp;R at the local tea house, go shopping at the market, have a campout away from civilization and so much more. Encounter military patrols, bandits and supernatural beings that cross your path as you travel. Nearly any encounter can turn into a battle at a moments notice. Place your teammates on the battlefield and fight to achieve your objectives. Move your units into position to attack enemies, use abilities and items or to defend innocents caught in the fray. With a diverse character class-system including ronin, ninja, priests and bandits, as well as a collection of ally npc and enemy classes, combat will always keep you on your toes. Build your team for brutal destruction or for control of the battlefield using evasion and status ailments. There are many paths to travel, which ones will you choose for your Agents of the Outcaste?",
