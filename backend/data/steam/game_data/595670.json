    "description": "Dehoarder 2 is a Life Simulator where you take control of the life of Harry the Hilldale Hoarder. You must help Harry to get his life in order before the building inspector fines him into oblivion and forecloses on the family home. But change comes hard for Harry, and at first he will only be willing to part with the simplest of things and do a minimum of work.<br><br>As he gains confidence and willpower from cleaning up his life, he will be able to dispose of progressively more significant items. In addition to parting with more of his hoard, Harry's increased willpower will allow him to gradually face other challenges in life, like making healthy meals, establishing a career in order to secure a steady income, and confronting a boorish and bullying neighbor.<br><br>Harry doesn't have to do it all alone, though. His best friend Joe is concerned about Harry's well-being, and is willing to lend help if Harry is willing to accept that help.<br><br>With a steady income, healthier body, and cleaner home, Harry will be able to begin the long-overdue task of remodeling and redecorating the house, though the struggle against Harry's hoarding impulses continues.<br><br>&quot;Dehoarder 2&quot; expands on the concept of the first Dehoarder game with a full 2-bedroom house set on a beautiful suburban lane, and a story about a personal quest for healing, growth, and self-realization. In addition to having to sort through all of the junk he has hoarded, Harry must also face and overcome an onslaught of problems both self-inflicted and externally imposed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🎭Dripping With Parody, Sarcasm, and Humor🎭</h2>Through the casual intermixing of existing Smiling Cat game worlds, a new world called &quot;Parallodia&quot; was accidentally created during the development of Dehoarder 2. The whole world seems to exist as a parody to our world. There are some anachronistic tendencies, and it appears to be our world as seen through the fun house mirror, you know, the mirror that makes us look silly and ridiculous. Jokes hide everywhere, even in the names of simple things.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🏡Full House and Yard to Dehoard🏡</h2>A two bedroom, one bath single family home set on a lot spanning over half an acre provides the perfect setting for your dehoarding adventures. Similar neighboring houses stretch on as far as the eye can see, and wooded hills back up to every lot. Cars drive by, birds soar, and occasionally a plane from the local airport passes overhead. At night, bask in the chorus of crickets under the full moon.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🧹Clear an Uncanny Variety of Junk🧹</h2>In addition to the classic set of items included in the first Dehoarder game, there are hundreds of new varieties of junk to dispose of, from traffic control devices, to toys, to catalogs and books, and much, much more. Junk containers hold even more junk that needs to be disposed of. Thought you were done with this room? What about that drawer over there?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >💰Sell Junk in an Interactive Market💰</h2>Sell your junk on eJunk, the premier auction site for hoards of stuff. Post judiciously, though, because if you oversaturate the market, bid prices will plummet. Play the market to your advantage by selling the hottest items.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🍳Cook for Healthy Eating - Or Just Order Pizza🍕</h2>Combine ingredients in the kitchen to create nourishing meals. Or if you don't have the time and energy for all of that fuss (or if the kitchen is an unsanitary mess), just order out for pizza. But remember - choices matter!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🚧Mend Fences with Neighbors🚧</h2>Harry's neighbors are understandably frustrated with Harry's behavior up until now, and some of them handle it better than others. Some will still try to help Harry, but others may be downright hostile and assaultive. It's up to you to set things right so that the neighborhood can live in harmony.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🚑Life Happens Whether We Want It To Or Not🚒</h2>You must be prepared for anything - alien invasions, neighborhood bullies, overzealous investigators, malicious pranksters, lycanthropy, extreme inclement weather, and fire, to name a few.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🪑Buy Custom Furnishings, Redecorate Your Way🪑</h2>Grab one of your hundreds of furniture catalogs that are laying around and order some furniture. Need furnishings to keep our hero entertained, happy, and healthy? Interactive furnishings allow you to rest, take leisure, and perform other activities. Place furnishings anywhere you can find a clear spot - provided you can find a clear spot.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🔨Remodel the Entire House🔧</h2>As part of your quest for renewal, you can refinish and replace various aspects of the house to reflect your personal taste. Want bright yellow siding with purple trim? You got it. Wood panel walls from the 1970's? Sure, why not. But what will the judges from &quot;Nicer Homes (than yours)&quot; magazine have to say about it?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >📈Get a Job, Advance Your Career📉</h2>The daily newspaper's help wanted section can help you find an entry level job of your choice. Find hours and pay that are suitable for you and go to work! If you perform well at your job, special things may happen. You may even get to save the world or become a Movietown legend!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🌷Tend Gardens for More Beauty🌷</h2>Transform your gardens from weed-choked tangles to beautiful floral presentations. Nurture desirable plants with water and fertilizer, and kill off weeds with herbicide.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🐀Rid Your Home of Vermin🦟</h2>The cockroaches from the first Dehoarder game are back, and they have evolved! In addition there are also flies, mosquitoes, mice, and rats to contend with. Ridding the house of vermin will go a long way toward making a healthier environment to live in, though eradication is only temporary if the mess that drew the vermin remains.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🧰Make it Your Own With Modding🧰</h2>Using the Unity 3D Editor, create mods using the game's increasingly-well documented modding and scripting system, using the same interfaces used by the developer to build the game. Then, share your creations with the world!",
