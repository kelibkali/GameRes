Players will have to strike a balance between upgrading their base structures, weapons and skills while holding and pushing back the invaders. After turning back the enemy hordes, players will have to face their ultimate commander : an Ancient of unknown skill and Power… are you brave enough to join?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Choose the Braver that speaks to your soul!</strong></h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1198020/extras/a14b4be719e68b25376d9cd4b19fe38b.poster.avif?t=1579025866\" width=640 height=172 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1198020/extras/a14b4be719e68b25376d9cd4b19fe38b.webm?t=1579025866\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1198020/extras/a14b4be719e68b25376d9cd4b19fe38b.mp4?t=1579025866\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Each Braver has unique skills and abilities that will affect how you play.
