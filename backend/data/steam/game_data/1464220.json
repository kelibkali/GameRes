This game will be finished as long as I'm physically able to work on it.<br>I'm doing everything in my power to combat this risk - for example, marketing and getting to a certain number of wishlists before release should prevent it from ever occurring - but I think it's still important to be honest about risks like this before release.<br>If you want Netherguild to reach its full potential, you can help by letting your friends, favorite streamer or gaming news site know about it! (:</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > <strong>Plans:</strong> Updates will happen over time; I usually post weekly updates on Netherguild's Discord (unless I'm just about to release a massive update or recovering from one!).</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > <strong>Expectations:</strong> Expect progress to be slow and steady- being a solo dev means I can't finish the game in a year, and big updates will take time. Also, expect me to always be active on the Netherguild discord during Early Access, listening to your feedback.</p></li></ul>",
