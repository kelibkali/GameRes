    "description": "IN THE DARK is an exploration-action metroidvania taking inspiration from modern indie games like Celeste, Hollow Knight, and Undertale. It involves various segments of platforming and combat as you explore deeper into a dark and unknown world full of friends, enemies, and everything in between. As you progress through the game, you will find and unlock new abilities for yourself that allow you to more greatly traverse and explore the world around you. Made by a single guy, IN THE DARK is about confronting change and dealing with uncertainty in a mysterious world.",
