    "description": "Pecaminosa blends the charm of a pixel art ARPG with the stifling atmosphere of film noir. It’s like mixing The Legend of Zelda with Touch of Evil — you haven’t seen and played anything like it! Interrogate suspects, explore a city dominated by crime and sin, and never hesitate to use your fists and guns. These are hard times in Pecaminosa.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1366770/extras/151bb1fa3eeff5333bf85ff33ed7d31d.poster.avif?t=1709853033\" width=618 height=299 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1366770/extras/151bb1fa3eeff5333bf85ff33ed7d31d.webm?t=1709853033\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>Customize your character's equipment and improve your skill set by distributing experience points among the four parameters of the L.I.F.E. system: Luck, Intelligence, Force and Endurance.
