    "description": "Glide, swoop, tuck, dive, magnetize, grind, walldrive, and burn your way through rings to advance the difficulty of the vast, procedurally-generated environment while avoiding the fog and getting stranded!<br><br>stratO is a demanding game that requires a lot of dedication and determination but rewards you with the ability to make a friction-fueled rocket-glider pull off stunts that surpass anything you've seen in a movie. But forget everything you know about other flight sims and flying games. IT CAN'T HELP YOU HERE!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/341680/extras/fdf0c985fe1bdb3f461a945b946c4fc5.avif?t=1452543516\" width=540 height=304 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><br>- Rather than telling your plane to go up/down/left/right, you control INDIVIDUAL air deflectors, and the sum of their generated torque is the result.<br>- This means that although the controls are harder to learn, a master pilot can pull off very tight aerobatic stunts and emergency recovery manoeuvres.<br>- Procedurally-generated world that gets more difficult as you collect more rings.<br>- Interwoven and deep game mechanics -- slide to boost, boost through rings or slide during a boost to refuel, tuck to magnetize wings and slide easier and double engine thrust and decrease drag, and that's just the start!<br>- Tight controls are simple to learn, but challenging to master. Being good at stratO is something to be _proud_ of.<br>- PC Version supports keyboard controls, XBOX Controllers (with vibration) and generic gamepads/flight sticks<br>- All controls are remappable (including menu &amp; interface navigation)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Other Features</h2><br>- Flightstick users can press+hold on the main control menu button(The one with the star on it for 3 sec) to toggle the game to pitch/yaw/roll controls<br>- Alternate colour scheme for airplane &amp; orientation indicators for players with Deuteranopia",
