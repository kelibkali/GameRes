    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Do you remember how, as a child, you used to holiday with your parents, traveling in an old camper? It's still in the garage, wasting away. The the neighborhood kids used it to paint graffiti on it; it is eaten by rust, and the furnishings and equipment are just scrap at this point. Renovate it, equip it and go on holiday to a selected location! Have adventures at the campsite - although it may not be an idyll, with a troublemaker son and a grumpy wife. If, at the end of your holiday, you find a buyer for your camper - sell it, and use the money to buy another, larger camper. And since you've done so well and had a great time to boot, expand the business of renovating campers to earn money and organize your next holiday in new places.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1339490/extras/3ef94b298923ee18ba36001de57e11ca.poster.avif?t=1755529482\" width=616 height=240 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1339490/extras/3ef94b298923ee18ba36001de57e11ca.webm?t=1755529482\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1339490/extras/3ef94b298923ee18ba36001de57e11ca.mp4?t=1755529482\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Get rid of graffiti and rust, repair the most important elements, weld, cut sheet metal, tighten, invest in new parts.

During your camping trips you will meet many new and well-known people. Sometimes you might get the impression that some of them are stalking you, because they always pop up wherever you go with a new camper for sale. Some may simply be mean. Others may surprise you. Camper camping adventures maybe a greater challenge than renovations of old campings.</p>",
