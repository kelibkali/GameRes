    "description": "A weird and cozy time with ambiant and dreamy music from the game LAVALAMP.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLAVALAMP is a free game. If you want to help us, this OST is a way to do so!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll the music has been composed and produced by the game creator, Gabriel Ledoux, in his bedroom. Inspired by electronic music, movie-like strings sounds and music from ending credits of Saturday-morning cartoons, this soundscape will send you in a familiar but strange after-noon.",
