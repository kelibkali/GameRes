The UHD image captures the original illustration in great detail and you will be able to observe even the finest of details exactly as the artist has painted them on the canvas. The puzzle as such is of moderate difficulty, presenting many distinct areas to concentrate upon while also having certain elements that would aim to trick your eye. The border of the illustration will also provide a significant challenge, especially on higher puzzle tilesets, so it might not be the wisest move to start from it.",
