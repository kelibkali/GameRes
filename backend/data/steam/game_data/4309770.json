    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Cluster Truck</h2>  For centuries the Truckers have kept the worlds of the Estuary Cluster connected. Long years, hard years, but proud years. Trucking is a way of life, even if it ends with a Trucker's Wake. <br><br> <br> Now the corporate shipping lines want to take over the spacelanes. Canaveral Station is under blockade, rigs impounded and crews in the slammer. The only thing left to do is hold a wake for a way of life.<br><br> <br> Unless...<br><br> <br>  'This is Angry Bird to Slicksilver. The Smokeys have bought your diversion. Starting my run.'<br><br> <br>  'Hardhat to Angry Bird. I'm on your six.'<br><br> <br>  'Rocket Jockey here. Commencing... that thing I'm about to do.'<br><br> <br>  'Don't die, you hear me? Darksky, you there? We're kickin' the door open for ya. Seeya on the other side.'<br><br> <br> Cluster Truck is a complete campaign that will see your Travellers take command of their own small craft, hauling cargo across a system. They will steal potatoes, get covered in frozen beer in deep space, take part in a history-making riot, uncover corporate skullduggery, and smash a blockade while confounding local law enforcement!<br><br>&quot;<i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>James Lillard</strong><br><br><br><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Traveller 2E (Mongoose) ruleset.<br><br><br><br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extensions and ruleset you have loaded.<br><br><br>",
