Initially, it's a home-collaboration kind of project developed for my daughter to get her interested in VR but it's gradually evolved into a casual/party game that many of us enjoyed with.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPress the trigger alongside music beats to unleash devastating power to the enemies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour enemies are little virus bits trying to reach the heart, and you are the last line of defence!",
