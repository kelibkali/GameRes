It has strong roots in established classics but adds its own individual twist to the well-known formula.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1153730/extras/4bbae014572897db0142073d3d9444ec.avif?t=1597934251\" width=800 height=358 /></span><br><br><strong>You can control many characters, from brave Rose Militia members who have taken up arms against the evil Yamagami Corporation, to powerful steam robots, renegade enemy soldiers, and even the main heroes of the game. Use the skill tree to level up characters and assemble your army for each battle.<br>Once you select a character, you can command them to move, run, look around, place a sentry, or open fire on the enemy - the choice is yours.<br>However, be wary that your opponent is a skilled strategist, and they’ll be looking at every opportunity to exploit your mistakes, flank you, and take the upper hand in battles.</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1153730/extras/7435ad0698b477b06309c58278b90065.avif?t=1597934251\" width=600 height=296 /></span><br><br>STRATEGIES<br>To counter this, make sure to approach each battle with a well-planned strategy in mind.<br>Since the game isn’t hex or square-based, use the extra freedom to position your troops in just the right place to get the upper hand on the enemy, and crush them.<br>You can also exploit the endless possibilities offered by the terrain and quickly gain a strategic advantage by taking control of the high ground or using buildings for cover. In fact, that’s one of the best ways to level the playing field and fight back against Yamagami’s superior numbers. <br>Remember, you’re part of a desperate rebellion… leverage the surprising power of guerilla tactics. Just make sure you always cover your back because the Yamagami will often send in reinforcements to overpower you. Don’t let them - this is your fight to win!<br><br><strong>WILL YOU JOIN US AGAINST THE EVIL?</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1153730/extras/94a60dd9eb1c86b494f9fa24bd7bb582.avif?t=1597934251\" width=600 height=234 /></span>",
