    "description": "The 58th year of Shouwa, early summer.<br>It’s June, and the summer heat has arrived earlier than it does most years. <br>By day there are crickets, and by night there are cicadas. <br><br>We’re in Hinamizawa, a small village in the countryside. <br>There are fewer than two thousand people here. But every year, there is an event. <br><br>This event is a mysterious death. <br><br>On a certain day in June, someone dies, and someone else goes missing. <br>The series of deaths is connected to the upheaval surrounding the dam construction project. <br>A murder case that was covered up is being reenacted. <br>Is it a conspiracy? A coincidence? Or perhaps a curse? <br><br>Someone who was supposed to be there isn’t. <br>Someone who wasn’t supposed to be there is. <br><br>Someone who was alive last night is dead now. <br>And someone who is here right now isn’t alive. <br><br>So, there is no way to avert tragedy. There is no choice but to give up. <br><strong>But don’t give up. </strong><br><br>Only you can stand up to this.",
