    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This is a trial &amp; error item combination game with a light automation layer.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >It is inspired by 'Alchemy' genre games (ex: 'Doodle God', etc) where you experiment to see which items combine together, then rig up some conveyor belts to make a bunch of them.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >WARNING:  This is a small, experimental game we made in 2015.  It was intended as a short experiment to mash up two very different genres and see how it would turn out.  <strong>&gt;&gt; This game is only an hour long. &lt;&lt; </strong> Please do not buy it if you are not comfortable with a short game or are not interested in casual games.  It has conveyor belts but does not play like 'Factorio' or other deep automation games.  Only buy it if you are interested in an hour or so of meme-y trial &amp; error item combination with conveyor belts. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Step 1: Craft weapons</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Create products by combining the natural resources of our glorious country.  Refine those products to make weapons!  How about... vodka + exercise machine = Vladimir Putin's gym shorts?  Its manly odor is both powerful and deadly. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Step 2: Automate your factory</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Now that you've figured out how to build one weapon, can you make hundreds of them?  Build out your factory for mass production with conveyor belts, barriers, pushers, black holes... wait... why did you put a black hole in the factory?!  Nooooo </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Step 3: EXTREME CAPITALISM!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Now that we're mass producing weapons, we can sell those off and upgrade the factory to build more profitable (and complex) weapons.  Discover new technology phases like Sand Age, Copper Age, Iron Age, and the most advanced technology: Potato Age. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > Craft weapons &amp; create factories</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > New Game+ mode</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > Cross-device cloud saving</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > Create your own resources &amp; weapons in the Blueprint DB -- plus share your mods easily with the world via cloud mod sync</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > Full game included, no microtransactions</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Limited replayability warning</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >As mentioned above, the game lasts about an hour.  As a short experimental game, it doesn't have a ton of replay potential, but after you beat the game the first time, you can new game+ to get an additional factory tool on your next playthrough (with there being new six tools you can get this way.)  Since the items and objectives are otherwise the same, this is also a good time to go to the blueprints system and download some custom weapons and build those to give you some variety.  You can also try to earn the achievements.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Note for cloud features:  I am doing my best to keep the blueprint servers online, but given its advanced age at this point I cannot guarantee those will be up forever.  (The game does function offline without the cloud features.)</p>",
