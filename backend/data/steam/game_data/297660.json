    "description": "It is the year 198X. Big hair is hot, and the war with the Soviets is colder than a refreshing glass of New Coke. RAD RAYGUN must travel the world fighting communist robots, and save the 1980′s by shooting his way through the decade in a totally fresh, expanded version of the original XBLIG game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSUPER RAD RAYGUN pits Rad against a whole new wave of deadly enemies and locations – from the Communist strongholds of the Far East to strategically insignificant islands off the South American coast. But chill out, because Rad has gnarly new weapons, upgrades, and a revamped gameplay engine to help him out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUltra sharp 144p resolution graphics and 4 unique shades of monochrome off-green bring Rad Raygun to life, as only 80′s mobile technology can.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nComing November 2016 for PC, Mac, and Linux.",
