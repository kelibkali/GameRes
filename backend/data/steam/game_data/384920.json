    "description": "To view our F2P Military Veteran program, please visit our Website (www.GagAMaggotEnt.com) for details. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nABD is a franchise behind the failed, ABD: A Beautiful Day, a MMORTS which ran from March 2015 to January 2016.  ABD is back and better than ever Q1 2017, with ABD: 1851 C.E. a MMOFPSRPG from GAM Entertainment!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nABD: 1851 C.E. takes place in the Utah Territory, during a fictional drought, where you and your fellow patrons brave the frontier life from one of two towns.  The American Gold Rush ran from 1848-1956, which was a very brutal and iconic undertaking that defined the 18th century.  This era has been romanticized in Television and Film for the better half of the 20th century, easily carving its way into the hearts and minds of all of us.  Unfortunately, most of the participants in the Gold Rush either ended up dead, or ultimately were forced to head home with little more than they came with.  In Q1 2017, I certainly expect you to follow suit and take part in the epic journey however you see fit.  Just take it easy on the Liquor, Poker, and Gunplay ;p.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n•Anticipated Rating: M for Mature.<br />\r\n•24 hour, 7 days a week continuous game area.<br />\r\n•Large Desert Playfield<br />\r\n•Holiday Events.<br />\r\n•Men, Women, and Children. <br />\r\n•Historical accuracy.<br />\r\n•Unique Technology system.<br />\r\n•Unique Crafting and Equipment system.<br />\r\n•Diverse Economy.<br />\r\n•Full Dismemberment.
