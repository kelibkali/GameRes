It is full of dragons! And it is totally insane! It used to be a world where dragons lived together in peace and harmony. But one day an evil wizard cast a spell that turned most of the dragons into evil minions. He also reduced the amount of mana in the air. The mana enabled the dragons to fly and spit fire. Without it the resistance against the wizard died quickly. All hope was lost until one day a dragon was gifted with the power to see the few remaining mana hotspots in the air and use them to his advantage.",
