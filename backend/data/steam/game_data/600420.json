    "description": "<strong>Welcome to 1930′s America. Thanks in a large part to Prohibition, organized crime is on the rise and a number of criminal families are fighting for national control of the illicit markets – booze, prostitution, numbers, you name it – it’s all sprouting up like weeds through Johnny Law’s clenched fist!</strong><br><br>This is a dog-eat dog world of corruption, murder and sex – and as the new kid on the block you’re looking a little like ‘milk on the bone’!<br><br>Mob Rule is a Real-Time Strategy game that simulates an underworld grab for power, wealth and real estate. You’ll start off as a small time thug and you’ll have just enough assets to build a soup kitchen. Choose a tenant and start working the ‘hood’.<br><br>Slowly but surely you’ll build up an empire and drive away your competition. You’ll conscript a loyal workforce, fix things with the cops, make the right pay-offs and succeed in your quest for total control.<br><br>Alternatively, you might just screw up completely and end up sleeping with the fishes!<br><br><strong>Game Features</strong><br><br>Over 40 unique and upgradable buildings!<br><br>Three kinds of troops: Thugs, Repairmen and Gangsters!<br><br>Ten quirky tenants!<br><br>Multiple resources to manage and use to construct your empire!",
