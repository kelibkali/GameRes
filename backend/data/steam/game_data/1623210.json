    "description": "Bored of playing the protagonist that saves the world? Remember the times when it was good to be evil? In Soulash you'll be able to unleash your Berserker rage at annoying NPC characters and butcher them for meat. You will torture mortals with fire and electricity as a powerful Warlock. Summon an unlimited army of zombies and skeletons and rot everything in your path as a Lich Necromancer. And if you prefer the unexpected, you can't go wrong with a Goblin Inquisitor!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623210/extras/dfd2110f79c4b40fb5239adc1ed85a87.avif?t=1682328764\" width=616 height=332 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >This world is yours for the taking</h2><br>A forgotten god versus the whole world.
