    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Deadlands Reloaded: Knights With No Armor</strong></h2>Knights With No Armor by Matthew Cutter is a Savage Tale for Deadlands: The Weird West, designed for buckaroos whove traveled its twisted trails long enough to achieve at least Veteran Rank. The story nominally begins in southern Cochise County, Arizona Territory, but the Marshal can transplant it to any spot on the Mexican border without too much fuss. Its a one-two punch of a story: What starts out as a simple rescue soon turns into a peek into the machinations of one of the Weird Wests most wicked and corrupt villains.<br><i>Fantasy Grounds Conversion:</i> <strong>Kevin Doswell</strong><br>Requires Savage Worlds core rules and the Deadlands Reloaded setting books to play.<br>Knights With No Armor was originally published in the print edition of the Savage Worlds Explorer, available at our website or your favorite local game store.<br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Savage Worlds ruleset.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Kevin Doswell</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
