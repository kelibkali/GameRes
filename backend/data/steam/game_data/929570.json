    "description": "This game was created to help others feel the frustration of having dyslexia.<br />\r\nYou play as a small fox a fairytale story with Kings, Queens, and witches.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is a text-based adventure created with the intention of allowing the user to experience the frustration of being dyslexic. <br />\r\nSentences and words are made intentionally hard to read through different rules of how they are constructed change with every chapter, ranging from a flickering background, jittery letters and PQBS's being swapped around.<br />\r\nChoices must be made in a quick time which leads to even more frustration. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMuch like a book, you could skip to the end of this game thought the chapter select menu but this is supposed to simulate the fact that you can do this but don't get any satisfaction from doing so. You can re-read chapters to see if you can get a better outcome.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are a bunch of options to try to make the game easier to play based on people's common conceptions on what fixes dyslexia.<br />\r\nThere is an option to add a colored overlay and remove the flicker in an attempt to combat &quot;Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome/ Irlen Syndrome&quot;.<br />\r\nAnd there is an option to change the font to Open Dyslexic which in my opinion is harder to read.<br />\r\nThere are options which allow you to play the game in non-dyslexic mode if you want, but wheres the fun in that. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game includes a range of accessibility settings.<br />\r\nColor Overlays<br />\r\nPage Flicker Off<br />\r\nOpen Dyslexia Font<br />\r\nText To Speech<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe don't claim to be actually like what a dyslexic persons sees, but merely a simulation of the frustration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReview by John Walker:<br />\r\nhttps://buried-treasure.org/2019/11/19/a-familiar-fairytale/?fbclid=IwAR0yg4mFoclDV89ZTHamhMm2kV1MoiFitAAgzyNXuV-2qR2DjNyw1FVl5_U",
