    "description": "The Bloodbound are mortal warriors who have sworn themselves to Khorne, god of carnage and slaughter. Blinded by battle madness, lost to the exultant sensations of combat, they care for nothing but the kill. The warband led by the brutal killer known as Garrek Gorebeard, are frenzied cannibals, mortals whose dark excesses have drawn them ever further into the thrall of the Blood God. They eschew heavy armour, preferring to feel the blood spatter across their chests, and chase their prey as tirelessly as hunting wolves. <br><br>Unlock this warband and play as <strong>Garrek's Reavers</strong> in <i>Warhammer Underworlds: Online</i> now.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >THE WARBAND</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> This warband consists of 5 fighters, who can outnumber and outmaneuver most warbands!<br></li><li> Bloodreavers become Inspired when a certain amount of warriors have been taken out of the game. Note that both enemies and allies count towards this total, so losing a few of your own warriors is not necessarily a fatal blow.<br></li><li> Garrek and his fighters possess a varied and lethal selection of abilities and weapons that can deal with any foe. </li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >TIPS &amp; TRICKS</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The key to a successful Bloodreaver strategy is recognising which of your warriors to sacrifice, and when.<br></li><li> Ideally, you will want to score plenty of fast-scoring, aggressive objectives early on, accepting the deaths of your weaker fighters while stashing up as many glory points as possible.<br></li><li> Purchase upgrades for your heavy-hitters, such as Garrek Gorebeard and Blooded Saek because once these champions are fully equipped and Inspired, there are few enemy fighters that can stand against them.<br></li><li> Objectives that reward you for an aggressive, mobile playstyle are well suited to the Bloodreavers, particularly those that can be scored out quickly – don’t overlook the Hold Objective cards, as these can be a great way to score points early on.</li></ul>",
