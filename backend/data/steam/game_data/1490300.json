    "description": "Do you remember hearing Zia's beautiful voice cut through the Calamity when first setting foot in Prosper Bluff? Or confronting Sybil on the stage of the Empty Set as everything around you, including the song &quot;In Circles&quot;, seemed to fall apart?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe music of Supergiant Games has always been vital to the experience. Now, the most memorable songs from each of the games we created in our first 10 years are brought to life like never before in The Songs of Supergiant Games: 10th Anniversary Orchestral Collection.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe traveled from our San Francisco headquarters to the world-famous Studio Two at Abbey Road Studios in London to record the unique orchestral arrangements found on this album. Our composer and audio director Darren Korb carefully supervised every detail of this production, while providing vocals and guitar on the album; longtime collaborator Ashley Barrett also sings for each piece, all to the accompaniment of an orchestra conducted by Austin Wintory.",
