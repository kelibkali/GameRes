I hope Davey’s next venture is as bold and soul-baring as An IOU, the visual novel medium welcomes (needs) it.&quot; - GRIMOIRE OF HORROR<br><br>&quot;<strong>AN IOU</strong> is the highly anticipated debut game by Davey Cadaver.     <br>Taking cues from beloved visual novels like<i> Doki Doki Literature Club</i>, <i>The House in Fata Morgana</i>, and <i>Higurashi: When they Cry</i>, and weaving it with masterful storytelling, and a cinematic flair, he has created something truly memorable.  <br>A visual artist by profession, he set out to create a graphic novel with acclaimed illustrator, Trevin Wyant. During this ambitious foray, Cadaver decided to go even bigger and the graphic novel also evolved into an interactive experience that is sure to engage audiences worldwide.     <br><br>Davey believes that story and character are two of the most important elements to an enjoyable game and it's apparent with <strong>AN IOU</strong> because the two protagonists are not only relatable, they feel like real people that you've known your entire life. <br>My only complaint is that I wish the game were longer because I'm not ready to say goodbye to Trevor &amp; Mallory!  <br>  <br><strong>AN IOU</strong> is the culmination of years of work and is obviously filled to the brim with passion, dedication, and creativity. This is one of the best games I have ever played by a solo game developer and Davey Cadaver has definitely left his mark on the visual novel community. <br>I can't wait to see what the future holds for him &amp; for those of us eager to play his next release.&quot;  -Scott Elster<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2052140/extras/5f223a94a974c394011ce0017a42283a.avif?t=1688779356\" width=616 height=352 /></span><br><br><strong>Content is generally suitable for ages 17 and up. <br>May contain intense violence, blood and gore, sexual content and/or strong language.</strong>",
