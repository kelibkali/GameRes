    "description": "<p><i>Stalin vs. Martians</i>, as the name suggests, is a game both masterfully trashy and absolutely over-the-top. Fun and accessible, it takes a simple arcade-like approach to the genre of real-time strategy. The player controls the Red Army, as it defends Earth from the Martian Invasion of 1942, that highly classified military operation which even today remains a closely guarded state secret. Stalin himself conducts the mission briefings, and later even becomes a playable unit. The bold leader is duly serious, even as he faces the most ridiculous threat the world has ever known.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The game itself is far from standard RTS fare: this is no realistic and deeply strategic war simulation, but a straightforward, fun and light-hearted arcade-style game - complete with power-ups falling from conquered foes in the form of bright shiny coins.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Unique concept and design.</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Fast-paced and lighthearted arcade-style real-time strategy, with power-ups, coin-collection and speedy reinforcements.</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Accessible and fun, well suited even for people who don't normally play strategy games.</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>A single-player campaign of 12 missions.</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Incredible Russian soundtrack and wild music-video intermissions.</li>\n\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t",
