    "description": "Check out this special edition of 3DCoat for modding in-game items, such as weapon skins and more. At this moment we’ve implemented support for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive only, but expect support for modding World of Tanks vehicles and other games soon.<br><br>The application enables fast downloading of archives from the game client into the program<br>distributive and unpacking the weapon model files. Create your own textures or apply<br>ready-made ones onto the weapon models. Bump technology, i.e. creating surface relief<br>imitation, is featured among the program's tools.<br><br>We have been able to simplify the process of creating weapon skins as much as it’s possible.<br>Now you do not need to install a bunch of various software to work with one model. All the<br>processes starting from loading the model and up to designing and publishing it into Steam<br>workshop can be done with 3DCoat only. Watch the trailer above to get familiar with the program's features<br>and the process of publishing the ready-made files into Workshop_Workbench.<br><br>Note: On purchasing this software you will automatically receive a unique registration key that will be linked to your account. No extra action is required from you to be able to use the program.<br><br>Enjoy and feel free to leave us your comments and feedback on <strong>3DCoat Modding Tool</strong>.",
