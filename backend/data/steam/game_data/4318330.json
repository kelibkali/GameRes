The enemy is relentless, adaptive, and always advancing. You don’t have the luxury of time.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Each run begins on a <strong>procedurally generated strategic map</strong> made up of contested nodes divided by a living frontline. Both sides deploy generals, fortify positions, and decide where to push next. However, each turn you can personally command <strong>only one battle</strong>. Every other conflict is <strong>simulated</strong>, with victories, defeats, and retreats dynamically reshaping the frontline and the future of your campaign.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4318330/extras/a53c638ac882ceea7bfe5f4b96da7159.poster.avif?t=1769009170\" width=1170 height=658 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4318330/extras/a53c638ac882ceea7bfe5f4b96da7159.webm?t=1769009170\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4318330/extras/a53c638ac882ceea7bfe5f4b96da7159.mp4?t=1769009170\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >When you choose a battle to fight, you <strong>crash-land on a contested planet</strong> and enter a short, intense real-time encounter. You must mine resources, build automation chains, and feed your weapons while under constant attack.
