    "description": "HOW LONG CAN YOU SURVIVE? Lord Pain has summoned his infernal minions once again to wreak havoc on the realms of men... As one of the last of the Bowmen, a long forgotten but elite Elven race that once guarded the living against this malevolent evil, you must conjure up your courage and venture forth toward the portal of doom to save mankind once again. With a bit of skill, a dash of luck, and the help of unusual accomplices, you may hold these demons off just long enough for the living to be saved and mankind to emerge victorious once again!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1241810/extras/76a550f107ef2719bd654c37f519b93e.avif?t=1689003564\" width=525 height=109 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1241810/extras/4fb249eec109aa5d5b702ef60411e599.poster.avif?t=1689003564\" width=588 height=293 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1241810/extras/4fb249eec109aa5d5b702ef60411e599.webm?t=1689003564\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br>Fight against Lord Pain's relentless armies in a single game mode called &quot;onslaught&quot;, whereby enemies spawn in progressively more and more difficult waves the longer you stay alive. To succeed, you'll need to call upon allies for aid, equip unique items, use health potions, and decimate your foes by detonating powerful explosives. <br><br>Leveling up your character after each encounter will allow you to invest in player attributes that will improve your character's damage throughput and survivability, slowly allowing you to progress into more daunting and brow-sweating difficulties. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1241810/extras/68bdf9dc1f7c68fcdc951d2ee56c2045.avif?t=1689003564\" width=525 height=109 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1241810/extras/fcdfb275d136bfbe4f40e30321307e04.avif?t=1689003564\" width=588 height=251 /></span><br><br><i>Bowmen</i> comes &quot;equipped&quot; (heh, see what I did there?) with a plethora of items that drop from enemies that have succumbed to your inescapable wrath.
