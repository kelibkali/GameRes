    "description": "AppGameKit Tier 1 offers an amazing set of powerful commands embedded within a variation of the BASIC programming language. But if you already know C++, there is always going to be the desire to move on to Tier 2 and use C++'s object-oriented features to increase your programming efficiency.<br><br>Until now, there hasn’t been much in the way of training material to help you make the transition from Tier 1’s BASIC to Tier 2’s C++. However, finally, we’ve corrected that omission with the release of The Official AppGameKit Tier 2 Starter’s Guide.<br><br>This short book will show you how to get started with Tier 2 programming in both Windows (using Visual Studio Community 2015) and Android (using Android Studio). <br><br>You’ll find out:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>How to use the free templates supplied by TheGameCreators to create your first Tier 2 app.<br></li><li>How to modify the existing templates<br></li><li>How to create more effective templates<br></li><li>How to add new classes to a project<br></li><li>How to build a static library that can be reused in multiple projects</li></ul><br>As usual, the book contains many activities (with solutions) to help you gain practical experience while working through the text<br><br><i>Please note that this book does not attempt to teach C++ or AppGameKit statements.</i><br><br>The guide was written and designed by author Alistair Stewart of Digital Skills.
