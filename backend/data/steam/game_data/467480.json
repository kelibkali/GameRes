    "description": "COSM Worlds is a viewer that lets you zoom into any object down to the molecular level and explore the tiny alien worlds within. COSM Worlds offers both VR and non-VR experiences, for OSX and Windows.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Explore structures based on real datasets</h2>Real 3D structure data is used to visualize large molecules, DNA, and cells. We plan to add MRI, CT scans, additional cell types, and much more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Watch real-time simulations</h2>See molecules scan DNA to express genes, or carry sacs of molecular cargo through the cell. We’ll be adding more simulation features to pack the worlds with action.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Learn more about what you see</h2>Worlds are annotated with descriptions so you can learn more about the processes happening around you or write your own tours and use COSM to teach others.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Connect tiny worlds to build a multiscale simulation of the universe</h2>As more worlds are built, they can be connected through zooming. Together we could build a model of the entire universe!</h2>",
