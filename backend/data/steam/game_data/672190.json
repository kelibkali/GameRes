    "description": "A unique artistic First Person Narrative experience. This game got 3RD in GMC JAM 8. This is a simple game which loosely tries to capture how I feel during sleep paralysis. This game has simplistic the simplistic controls of just WASD for movement and mouse-aim for looking around. But it presents the player with visuals which can be scenic and sometimes intense. This is a short narrative which aims to wisp the player away from reality toward an vibrant yet strange fantasy world which goes away before the viewer can even begin to figure out what's going on.",
