She created all the gods: Maritros, Noctarion, Ankarum, Maeve, Terraflora, Fulguris, Temporos, Tempestor, Sapiara, Phantamos and many others.  In Eo, the gods are watching you, and they want to be worshipped to be more powerful. So, choose a race, find others, survive, explore, build and change the world. We are trying a new concept where the players will take part in adventures that will actually shape the world and change it - maybe you will destroy and entire village for your god Murder or because Terraflora fears their advances will destroy a sacred forest. Find a way to communicate with the gods and they will help you with what you desire. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Playable races:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2075340/extras/f777091f557f1fba15590cc64d3c8627.avif?t=1752929193\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2075340/extras_big/f777091f557f1fba15590cc64d3c8627.avif?t=1752929193 width=800 height=450 /></span>- Humans - We are the most common race on Eo. We are also called The First Sons, because we were the first people created by the goddess. We are hard workers and we can learn any skills with ease.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2075340/extras/89c7e602b9dcd0fa61e9117b508211d0.avif?t=1752929193\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2075340/extras_big/89c7e602b9dcd0fa61e9117b508211d0.avif?t=1752929193 width=800 height=450 /></span>- Elves - We were the Second Sons of Eo. Upset with all the flaws she saw in Humans, Eo created us to be faster, lighter, more intelligent and able to brighten the dark with our inner light.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2075340/extras/9328d4204e324236233799b1c32425d8.avif?t=1752929193\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2075340/extras_big/9328d4204e324236233799b1c32425d8.avif?t=1752929193 width=800 height=450 /></span>- Orcs - We were not created by Eo. We are born from curses cast on elves and humans by in the Divine Wars. Our deformed shape is part of the trauma of that time.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2075340/extras/35e5c7b1a613696a0ee73396a751a316.avif?t=1752929193\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2075340/extras_big/35e5c7b1a613696a0ee73396a751a316.avif?t=1752929193 width=800 height=450 /></span>- Fey - When Eo created Terraflora, she immediately spawned us, the Fey. We are Terraflora's little helpers, her Archdruids. We protect the forests from devastation, plant trees and even defensive vegetation that help keep men and ravenfolk away. Unfortunately, some of us are dissevered from this way, falling in love with humans, even corrupting animals with orcs and ravenfolk. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2075340/extras/4d7d6749f13a391c11c088a7ed097ea9.avif?t=1752929193\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2075340/extras_big/4d7d6749f13a391c11c088a7ed097ea9.avif?t=1752929193 width=800 height=450 /></span>- Catfolk - When Noctarion fell, he created Demons and us. We were born to follow the Dark Prince and eradicate all evil. The Prince created all felines to be agile, fast and precise in our fight for Justice. We are the superior mortal beings, in service of the Prince that Brings Light, Noctarion, as well as Murder and Chaos. We will bring torture and damnation to all those who are weak and fall to the pleasures of the flesh. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2075340/extras/08bccbabf55a02305e3f0b18a1c5b474.avif?t=1752929193\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2075340/extras_big/08bccbabf55a02305e3f0b18a1c5b474.avif?t=1752929193 width=800 height=450 /></span>- Ravenfolk - We were not created by the goddess Eo. We were born from the mockery of Phantamos and Maeve. Defiants, they looked at the humans and elves, their beauty and perfection, and created us to laugh at Eo. However, we became wise, centered and in many aspects, superior.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2075340/extras/bd6ec6aab55fdfcd217943eeae255920.avif?t=1752929193\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2075340/extras_big/bd6ec6aab55fdfcd217943eeae255920.avif?t=1752929193 width=800 height=450 /></span>- Demon - We are also called Children of Noctarion. Men follow Eo because she forgives. We don't. We don't forgive murderers, thieves and traitors. Men are evil and these men will find only torture when they meet us. We are the true Warriors for what's good and pure. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2075340/extras/a64c0b9e416012df7db5a3374031d7cc.avif?t=1752929193\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2075340/extras_big/a64c0b9e416012df7db5a3374031d7cc.avif?t=1752929193 width=800 height=450 /></span>- Dark Elves - Disgusted by the weakness of elves, our people devoted themselves to Murder. Our Lord Murder purges the world of evil and in his trail of blood leaves only the honest and good behind. That is the true meaning of Good. In murder, we found strength, not weakness. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2075340/extras/5c1b67c8435875ce63e315a691642f4e.avif?t=1752929193\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2075340/extras_big/5c1b67c8435875ce63e315a691642f4e.avif?t=1752929193 width=800 height=450 /></span>- Maritrian - We were created by Maritros, Lord of the Seas. We were tasked by Him to create Maritros, a mighty underwater city. But some of us gave up the Ocean to live among humans, even using magical means to breathe out of the water, which was impossible before. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2075340/extras/b2da727a9ebd8e8bceec82c57328a804.avif?t=1752929193\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2075340/extras_big/b2da727a9ebd8e8bceec82c57328a804.avif?t=1752929193 width=800 height=450 /></span>- Goblin - We are the true children of Maeve. In the darkness, we do his bidding and from sunlight we hide. We trick, we lie and we find precious things for our Lord. She hates us and she loves us. Our existence makes as much sense as she wills it. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p>",
