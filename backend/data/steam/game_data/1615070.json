    "description": "Space Marmalade is a turn-based strategy game about piloting a starship, outfitted with a sophisticated weapons computer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game alternates geometry from grid to polar geometry, which is used to measure distances in a solar system environment. Ship are presented in a polar grid format, with a star or planet in the centre. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen firing, the game switches to a flat-grid. By drawing a straight line on the grid, the game converts this into a curved line in polar geometry. This twist on traditional grid-based mechanics creates an aesthetically unique experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers dispatch levels of procedurally-generated enemies, exploring luminous nebulas and slowly unravelling the mystery of what these starships are fighting over. The music continuously adapts on the fly, so that the feel of the game is always shifting.",
