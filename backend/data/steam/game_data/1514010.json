You are Diogo Álvares, shipwrecked off the Brazilian coast.<br>You have been betrayed by your crew members and handed to the cannibalistic Tupinambá natives.<br><br>You have freed yourself and now you must find a way to head back to Europe.<br>Will you get revenge on your crew, head back to civilisation<br>Or will you succumb to the wicked ways of the Cannibal Coast?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Tips</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> If you become a cannibal, your max health will increase, but each enemy will give you less energy<br></li><li> You always eat dead enemies when you touch them. You can shoot their corpses to make them disappear if you're going for a &quot;human-free diet&quot;<br></li><li> Every six levels, you will have a chance to collect ammo. But over time, there will be less ammo to collect<br></li><li> There are three different endings. Did you find them all?<br></li><li> The game saves automatically on every ammo gathering stage. So you can continue your game from the last ammo stage you visited.</li></ul><br><i>Please note:</i> This game is loosely based on the legend of Caramuru, but it doesn't follow the story too closely",
