    "description": "Party Crashers is a last-car-standing combat racer for one to four players! Following in the footsteps of Party Golf, it aims to provide the same fast-paced crazy customisable competitive couchplay, with options for everything our player community can think of, combined together however they can.<br><br><strong>Inspired by the classics such as Wrecked, Mashed, and (classic) Micro Machines,</strong> players must fight to survive. Crash off the track, fall too far behind, or take too much damage and you'll explode.<br><br><strong>Wreak havoc on our preset tracks,</strong> or try your luck with a limitless set of procedurally generated tracks to keep things fresh.<br><br><strong>Crash your way through over 60 game modes (and growing...)</strong> ranging from manic vehicular carnage in battle mode, to precise, skillful driving in time trial mode. Blast your way through a barrage of giant bananas, or pit a bunch of school buses against each other in a battle royale. <br><br>Build your own game modes that suit you or your friends, from hundreds of provided settings, e.g.:<br>▹ change the car model, top speed, acceleration, steering<br>▹ select powerups including turbo, cow catchers, railguns, homing missiles, and mines<br>▹ double the speed of the game, play in Top-Down mode, or even switch any mode into Split-Screen mode.<br><br>Participate in our community to make Party Crashers into the game YOU want. Use the discord to communicate directly with the developers with ideas for features and things you want to see in the game.<br><br>(8 Player mode coming soon, and game provides basic AI for playing solo)",
