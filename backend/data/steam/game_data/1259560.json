    "description": "Step aboard the <i>HMHS Britannic</i>, the third ship in the Olympic Class trio, who, like her older sister the <i>Titanic</i>, was cheated of a promising career. This ship has never been properly recreated before, and no one has seen her in this state since she sailed the Mediterranean. Now, as the result of extensive research by our team and leading <i>Britannic </i>historians, you can explore her and learn about her like never before.<br><br>BRITANNIC: PATRONESS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN is a virtual museum-like experience, where the user can explore the ship at their own pace and discover details about its story, architecture, and contributions to the First World War. This is primarily a learning environment, packed full of history.",
