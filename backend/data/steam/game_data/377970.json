    "description": "<i>&quot;One step closer to the blur&quot; she thought as she poured herself one last shot of whiskey, for the road. &quot;Sleeping pills and alcohol, perfect cocktail to forget memories you don't even have. How funny.<br>One last drop, close your eyes. A dreamless sleep, and the hope, the curse of being alive in the morning, with the certitude that everyday is exactly the same.<br>Shouldn't it be time for me to finally chase the past I gave up a long time ago? What a strange last thought, but it's getting dark, too dark to think... Maybe... Maybe tomorrow will bring more answers...&quot;<br>She fell in the majestic nothingness of the night while the singer on the old radio player was whispering his quiet prayer: &quot;I'll take the fate the daylight brings&quot;.</i><br><br><strong>Fragments and details, rainy nights and blurry lights are all VOID&amp;MEDDLER focuses on. A single night intrusion into Fyn's life and hopes. Tired of the last two years she spent wandering without a goal and without memories, among disenchanted strangers, and pitiless scavengers, Fyn decided to put an end to all of this. She’ll have a few hours to make things right, and seek strong, pure and substantial memories. In a city where genders and species melt into each other, maybe she’ll find the long lost touch of humanity missing from her life.</strong><br><br>The idea behind Void &amp; Meddler was to create a game that looks like its creators, two musicians nurtured by noise rock from the 80's, synthwave, road trips and cyberpunk literature. Together, we conjured the narration, we created No Wave, we tamed the weird, we fucked in an orgy of wires, neons and white noise. Distance doesn’t corrupt anything. Amps were set aside for a while, and we dived head first into another sphere we loved, full of code, textures and pixel art.<br><br>Enjoy Void &amp; Meddler, an indie adventure game full of fuzz literature, pixel music and analog dreams.<br><strong><br>EPISODE 2 NOW AVAILABLE WITH THE SEASON PASS DLC.<br>EPISODE 3 WILL BE AVAILABLE IN 2022.</strong>",
