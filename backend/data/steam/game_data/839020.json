Find his deadbeat brother Dixon, the man Willard hates, before someone even worse does.<br><br></li><li> The story centers around a fully lived-in, explorable starship — hand crafted by an artist — in the style of classic science-fiction vehicles like the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> or the <i>Serenity</i>.<br><br></li><li> Built For VR<br>Designed from the ground-up for a VR experience. Interact with objects and your surroundings in a realistic way, and try not to break anything. Pull levels and panels, command your spaceship, and communicate with a number of friendly or not-so-friendly characters, all without leaving your living room.<br><br></li><li> Play at your own pace. This is a game about exploration, about story and atmosphere. <br><br></li><li> Fully Voice-acted<br>Features a diverse cast of talented and professional voice actors for an immersive experience with branching, narrative dialog. Are you tough-as-nails, no time to argue? Or easy-going and just down on your luck? Optional subtitles can aid in the experience.</li></ul>",
