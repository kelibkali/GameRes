It’s all about the tactics: deploy your metallic players (yes, every one of them with the giant chainsaw and the shield!), destroy enemy turrets and mines to open the way forward, advance on the battlefield, and capture the bases of other players. The announcer will comment on your every step while the professional setting of the match will make every game even more exciting!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1503160/extras/4862eb757b44886fb86682ea3bf20520.poster.avif?t=1715279505\" width=610 height=236 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1503160/extras/4862eb757b44886fb86682ea3bf20520.webm?t=1715279505\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1503160/extras/4862eb757b44886fb86682ea3bf20520.mp4?t=1715279505\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Space Grid Tournament is the new generation of RTS games, where careful and fast team management leads the way to victory.
