You will be swapping paint and speeding through laps on a selection of unique tracks packed with obstacles and hidden shortcuts. Use either two-handed melee weapons to whack other players or sneakily shoot down their karts, all while trying to cross the finish line in first place.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159860/extras/2fe6bf3fcf820ff2200ef2f74cf6f93a.poster.avif?t=1667500070\" width=616 height=254 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159860/extras/2fe6bf3fcf820ff2200ef2f74cf6f93a.webm?t=1667500070\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159860/extras/2fe6bf3fcf820ff2200ef2f74cf6f93a.mp4?t=1667500070\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Wide Range Of Control Options</h2>Enjoy a next-level racing experience with Super Immersive control. You can grab the wheel in one hand and a weapon in the other, or even wield two weapons at the same time! Steering Wheel Support steps up the immersion factor with force feedback, letting you feel every bump, turn, and obstacle. If your hand gets tired from smashing opponents we also have a simpler Rest Mode control option for casual play and a great way to play in tight space.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159860/extras/533fa6154d6d92511b78014804541883.poster.avif?t=1667500070\" width=616 height=332 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159860/extras/533fa6154d6d92511b78014804541883.webm?t=1667500070\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159860/extras/533fa6154d6d92511b78014804541883.mp4?t=1667500070\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Full hand Weapons &amp; Power-ups</h2>From machine guns to frying pans, Dash Dash World has an awesome selection of weapons that you can use to get ahead of the competition. But it is not so straightforward with counterplay, where you can blind your opponents with Face Blaster as well as their minions such as Angry Crimson and more. Nothing is certain until you reach that finish line.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159860/extras/744da4850c90e70b2e8be833de9b39ed.avif?t=1667500070\" width=616 height=92 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Step into the World Of Speed</h2>Racers can drift around tight corners and charge their nitro and boost chain to reach max speeds during those tight finish line sprints. Pro players can use drafting to increase their speed sticking closely behind your competitors, gaining a slipstream effect. Better yet, use your speed off big ramps to start gliding over those spectacular views and clench a victorious landing.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159860/extras/4a158d90f683fd6c4d6eb72892921817.poster.avif?t=1667500070\" width=616 height=348 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159860/extras/4a158d90f683fd6c4d6eb72892921817.webm?t=1667500070\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159860/extras/4a158d90f683fd6c4d6eb72892921817.mp4?t=1667500070\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Racing Modes For Everyone</h2>Dash Dash World is great for players of all skill levels.
