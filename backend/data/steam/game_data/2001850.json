The player controls an above-average-intelligence raccoon searching for snack foods after the local government has banned them. Stumbling across a budding black market of cakes &amp; chips, players will have to steal phones &amp; other items to engage in a series of deals that will take them all over town to trade their way up to a coveted box of their favorite treats.",
