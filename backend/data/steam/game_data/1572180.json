Reefs around the world have been invaded by lionfish and unfortunately they feed on the local reef fish. Patrol the reef and remove as many lionfish as possible to help save the reef fish. In fact, for every lionfish you remove you save 25 reef fish, but be careful – there are sharks in these waters and capturing lionfish attracts them - and they will attack!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Lionfish Game Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">* Real life sounds of the ocean, breathing and bubbles</ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\">* Real life action of scuba diving</ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\">* Aggressive Shark that patrols these waters</ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\">* Most realistic lionfish hunting video game ever!</ul>",
