    "description": "Cyberganked is a CGA CRPG blobber and text adventure. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Internet is out. You just woke up one day to find it broken. Nothing works.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsually, when the Internet dies, you just sit and take it. Go for a hike, play with the dogs, drink that awful Chilean wine the Grundersons brought over, much to your chagrin.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut there's another choice you can make. Another way you can go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat if you took to the streets with your friends? To investigate why the net was down. To find out who was responsible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd what if you decided to break the face of every single person that got in your way? What if every single garbage human -- normally tucked safely away in the blanket of anonymity the Internet provides -- was also wandering around outside?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's time for everyone to get what's been coming to them.",
