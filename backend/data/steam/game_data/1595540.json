Sam is in charge of programming maintenance robotic units (MaRUs) to clean and maintain the robotics factory.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >But Is Everything As It Seems?</h2><br>Sam must use the MaRUs to prepare the old, unused parts of the factory for Project Asimov: an exciting, new, top secret robotics project. While taking on this task, Sam begins to notice many odd things about the new robot: it is supposedly designed for automating household chores, but there seems to be an odd amount of destruction related to its production.<br><br>While solving the puzzles of the game requires programming, it does not require you to have any prior programming knowledge. Your first foray into programming the MaRUs will involve simple tasks such as moving the MaRUs around a room. As you build your skills, you will encounter more difficult challenges such as using your robot’s sensors to navigate unknown paths or even exploiting the security holes in other robots to use them for your own purpose. Players with more programming experience will find extra challenges in how they go about completing each task.",
