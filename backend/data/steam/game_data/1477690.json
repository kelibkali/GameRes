    "description": "For your enjoyment, we introduce <strong>Autumn Fuji</strong> - high-quality photography made by our partnering artist, King Wong. The picture captures the Fuji mountain from a unique perspective and emphasizes its beauty.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1477690/extras/048ea4baf17f88bdd29c2922c0fc398b.avif?t=1606458446\" width=616 height=79 /></span><br>Contains <i>one</i> new puzzle box for Masters of Puzzle playable in variations of <i>250</i>, <i>500</i>, <i>750</i>, <i>1000</i>, <i>1500</i>, <i>2000</i>, and <i>2500</i> puzzle tiles. The photography offers an interesting mix of challenging sections - the leaves, the ocean, and the large area of mist. Since these areas are clearly defined, though, the overall assembly should not be too challenging for most of our fans. Make sure to rate the puzzle box once you finish it and leave feedback on whether you want to see more puzzles like this one or not.",
