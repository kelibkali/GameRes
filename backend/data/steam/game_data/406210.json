    "description": "The International, a legendary tournament, which had already become an annual celebration for all Dota 2 fans and spectators, came back in July of 2015. This time four teams from CIS were honored to prove themselves in a battle for 18 million dollars. But our story is about only one team – Virtus.pro. However, The International is not only about teams. Anton &quot;Mob5ter&quot; Erohin, who didn’t even know what Dota 2 was several years ago, had already become one of very few Russian &quot;voices&quot; of game broadcasting and was set out to get to TI. But The International didn't feel like a celebration for everyone. Dread, who gave over 5 years of his life for this game, once again had to visit TI not as a player, but as an analyst. What are his feelings and emotions? What goals do Virtus.pro pursue? How does Mob5ter imagine working in Seattle? And the main question: what does The International mean for these guys? You'll see in a new documentary by Ivan Demkin – «Over the dream».",
