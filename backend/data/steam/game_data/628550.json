Time travel might not currently exist but this game will hopefully bring you back in time to where somehow birds do massive damage. <br><br>Your task is to fight through nine action packed stages, filled to the brim with demons that you'll need to slay with your trusty cyber whip, <i>(or blast them with your side arm, your choice.)</i> However it doesn't stop there, within these worlds there lies dangers that you'll need to navigate past, from raising hot magma to walls crushing down on you. And after you've managed to survive to the very end, defeat the evil demon overlord, you'll have to do it all again but in glorious monochromatic handheld mode. <i>(This mode contains four all new levels to really test your skills)</i><br><br>Also included is a few extras such as challenges, a boss rush and that otherworldly &quot;sound test&quot; mode that you only ever see in vintage retro games.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/628550/extras/eaeb92f6c9591f7a913c1503b3332ead.avif?t=1671759304\" width=526 height=144 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>13 massive levels to conquer, each with it's own dangerous traps to dodge!<br></li><li>Huge end level bosses to completely destroy with your demon slaying whip!<br></li><li>Including both console and handheld versions of the game.<br></li><li>Boss rush and extra challenges.<br></li><li>Actual 8-bit graphics that follow strict limitations from that era. <i>(Even included is fake flickering for that extra nostalgia hit!)</i><br></li><li>Listen along to a chiptune soundtrack while banishing those demons back to where they came from!<br></li><li>Extras and Steam Achievements to, umm unlock!</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/628550/extras/97fbdfc660f16513d876da10d104d3c7.avif?t=1671759304\" width=526 height=144 /></span><br><i>Written in Engrish for that extra layer of authenticity</i><br><br>Every ninetieth solar eclipses is the time where the demons open up the portal to our world.<br>Every time the portal is at a different crypt.
