What is more important, friendship or love? Can you consider someone a criminal judging by the public's opinion only? And does our conscience have an expiration date after which the misconduct should no longer be taken into account? <br>Discover the answers by immersing yourself in a romantic story about life in a private school.</strong><br><br>Mia worked so hard to get into an elite school like Dotsten. She only needs to keep it up for one more semester, and her dream of brilliant recommendations and invitations to the best universities will come true. The only thing that was not a part of the girl’s plans was a spontaneous participation in the school play, which can change all her priorities. <br>Will Mia be able to figure out what her heart desires? The best guy at school? A troublemaker with a dark past? Or a brilliant stage director? Or maybe she'll have to choose between education, which leads to great opportunities or a first love that inspires her? <br> <br>This show for lovers will put everything in its place!<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>An exciting story;<br></li><li>Interactive extra scenes;<br></li><li>Imitation of a lesson with the ability to answer teachers' questions;<br></li><li>Three original male characters, each with their own unique storyline;<br></li><li>Hidden secret scenes;<br></li><li>Lots of detailed supporting characters;<br></li><li>Colorful extra illustrations shown throughout the story.</li></ul>",
