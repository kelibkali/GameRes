In some ways it is closer to a board game than an RPG. There isn't much plot or exploration in Rift Wizard- just epic wizard battles and deep buildcraft from start to finish.<br><br>I'm creating Rift Wizard because I want to push the boundaries of the genre.  I want to build a deep and challenging roguelike worth exploring for a thousand hours or more.   A game with hundreds of potential strategies to try.  A game where each run is a novel and exciting intellectual challenge.  A game that inspires the player to be crafty, creative, and brilliant.",
