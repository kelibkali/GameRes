While playing the game you won’t be able to kill or damage most of the enemies but at the same time running away without a second though is not the solution. While being chased you will need to think and reconsider your strategy and open hidden shortcuts while the world and it’s lore will unfold around you in a<strong> non-linear</strong> way making each playthrough diferent. From the creator of the multi awarded indie game of the year MIND: Path to Thalamus and the dev grant winner Koral.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/789950/extras/a803c825499946ed35b1717804ebf8e4.webp?t=1735906258\" width=600 height=24 /></span>Every little change you make in Infernium will remain like that forever. As a player you will have to be smart about harvesting (or not) Light, interacting with doors, barriers and elevators and even your death. Dying does not reset the world, it’s part of the experience. That’s why there will be consequences if you act careless with your deaths. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/789950/extras/85838b2ef2f53820467bb73f19766ca9.webp?t=1735906258\" width=600 height=56 /></span>Infernium is one of the easiest games to mod using the free Unreal Engine 4.

This tends to generate disconfort, anxiety and inquietude in the player. It is no coincidence most of the brutal dangers in Infernium can be found at daylight in plain sight rather than in the darker claustrophobic environments.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/789950/extras/72994f407794efac578d0de7e9b91f87.avif?t=1735906258\" width=600 height=456 /></span></p>",
