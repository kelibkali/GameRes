He hasn't gotten to Marmocle by accident, but he knows barely anything about this land. Unsure on where to go he heads to a pointy structure outside of the forest, away from the dangers of the forest. Soon he gets to meet a strange bird. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The game also features an experimental shared world online mode.
