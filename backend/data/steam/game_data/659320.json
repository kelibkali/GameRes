    "description": "*In a super deep movie voice* In a world deprived of pixels, Bit needs your help to restore the resolution in Chrominance. By using your sick pixel gun and platforming skills you can help save Chrominance from Spectre and get the girl (just kidding that's totally generic). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo complete this bad ♥♥♥ adventure you must go through a series of 3 worlds, each containing 20 levels (that's a total of 60 levels in case you have some trouble with math). There are a variety of obstacles you will have to surpass in each level, which will progressively become harder as you go. Some of these include spikes, lava, and enemies with guns.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the end of each world, these obstacles will seem pathetic compared to the boss of the world. Once you defeat the boss, some of the pixels in Chrominance will return. After defeating all 3 bosses, Chrominance will be completely restored. Will you save Chrominance?",
