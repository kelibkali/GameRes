    "description": "This game made in 3D graphics with a side view combines the atmosphere of old platform games with more modern graphics. I'm working on the game, inspired by the old, very first &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; for DOS, as well as by the wonderful &quot;Fez&quot;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe action takes place mainly underground at different levels. And in the final part  the events are transferred to the surface of the planet and into space. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main character still does not know how to jump and to swim, but I will definitely teach him. Stay tuned!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a browser-based 3D game that will be supplied as a build for Windows on Webkit. In theory it also can work in any browser that supports WebGL in any operating system - Windows, iOs, MacOS, Android, Linux and so on. But for now you can get the game as Windows 7-8-10 installation package.",
