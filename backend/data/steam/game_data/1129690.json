Every direction of gravity has a <strong>unique active color</strong> - destroying blocks of the <strong>same color</strong> guarantees you one of many mighty <strong>powerups</strong>. Gravity is changing faster and faster, and you should always be prepared for bigger challenges!<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1129690/extras/c495f5b766d1106c6c2f972469be6873.webp?t=1767279981\" width=600 height=26 /></span><br>In 3x64 you can get many types of powerups. You have <strong>3 slots for basic powerups</strong> - these can be easily earned by destroying active color blocks. Then you can <strong>use them whenever you want</strong>, or <strong>you can wait and craft much more powerful ones</strong> - the choice is yours! <br><br>Altogether there are 16 powerups in the game, including those that manipulate blocks, time, and strategic minigames such as arkanoid and shooting.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1129690/extras/1271450403771fa802cf31df73441709.avif?t=1767279981\" width=600 height=302 /></span><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1129690/extras/25c76e91fc0699b97e674be5e41e071c.webp?t=1767279981\" width=600 height=26 /></span><br>Apart from the basic color blocks, two additional types of blocks will make your game more challenging. Iron blocks spawn every so often, and can be destroyed only using powerups.
