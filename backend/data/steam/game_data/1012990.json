    "description": "<strong>mini PVP</strong>: Multiplayer mini arena battles. Chaotic, frantic, casual.<br><br>The game features a frantic free-for-all <strong>1</strong>v<strong>1</strong>v<strong>1</strong>v<strong>1</strong> combat. Just pick a character, and frag your opponents in a tiny map for the next 2 minutes! Take granular control of your adrenaline rush IRL: Play 2 matches, 22 matches or 222 matches. It's all up to you!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>4 player FFA </li><li>2 minutes long matches </li><li>3 characters, each with a distinctive skill </li><li>7 weapons </li><li>Super easy to pickup, even easier to master! </li><li>Private Matches <i>(friendship destroyer)</i></li></ul><br>--Geeky stuff below--<br><br>mini PVP is designed to provide a &quot;shot&quot; of instant joy, with minimal &quot;meta tracking&quot; demanded from the player. <br><br>The gameplay loop only adds two dramatic changes to the &quot;core&quot; competitive shooter experience:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Staying alive is as important as fragging rivals. </li><li>Different characters with mildly different stats and marginally different skills with relatively quick cooldowns.</li></ul><br><i>Staying alive is as important as fragging your rivals?</i><br>Here's why: Your score increases with each rival you frag, but it also decreases every time you get fragged. Sounds harsh, right? Don't worry. Multiple consecutive frags worth more points!<br><br>The characters in mini PVP all have different stats and skills, thus each are suitable for one of three play-styles: Balanced, Defensive, Aggressive.<br><br><strong>Ranger</strong> is a balanced character with average health and movement speed.<br>Skill: BOOM!<br>Throws 3 grenades at once! Grenades have a huge explosion radius. Useful for crowd/map control. <br><br><strong>Duff</strong> is a defensive character with massive health at the expense of a lower movement speed.<br>Skill: SHIELD.<br>Activates a damage absorbing shield that grants temporary invulnerability and minor health regeneration per bullet absorbed.<br><br><strong>Shade</strong> is a character with an aggressive play-style. She is the fastest character, but she has the lowest health.<br>Skill: SLICE. <br>Dash with high melee damage. Can be utilized both for close encounters and evasive maneuvers. Defies gravity. Increases movement speed.<br><br><br>That's all the meta! The rest is just... Fun!",
