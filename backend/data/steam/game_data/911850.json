Fight in handcrafted arena environments, each with its own dangers to take heed of while combating an onslaught of enemies. <br></li><li><i>Dismemberment arsenal</i> - tear off a limb, use it as a weapon. Each enemy type has a limb with unique properties for combat, while fast-degrading durability keeps you on the move for the next weapon, and the next kill.<br></li><li><i>Agile combat</i> - Circle-dash around enemies to get behind them, wall-run to cover distance, wall-jump to prep a smash attack. Throw your weapon for a ranged attack, counter an enemy when there's no room to breath.<br></li><li><i>Boss fights</i> - they will push you towards your edge. Use every tool you have to survive these extended combat sequences.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><i>Leaderboards</i> - compete against friends or global players as you perfect your score for each arena.<br></li><li><i>Stylized Look</i> - a mid-poly, gritty, painterly aesthetic presents a fractured old world through environmental storytelling, brought to life in Unreal Engine 4.<br><br>Add <strong>Torn Asunder</strong> to your wishlist to be notified when it launches!</li></ul>",
