That's all it takes to go down into the lands of endless darkness.<br>This project delivers a full 5th Edition campaign of dark fantasy adventure. It begins with undead plagues upon the surface, and then sends the heroes into the Underworld. Into the hungering dark.<br>Allied with vampires, the darakhul of the Ghoul Imperium turn their attention to the surface. Emperor Nicoforus the Pale remains wary of further expansion, but others are not satisfied with caution. These ghouls have set plans in motion to gain further control of the surface world and spread their dark religion across the land.<br>This project delivers a full adventure from levels 1 to 13 that begins with stirrings of ghoul trouble in Zobeck and eventually sends heroes into the Underworld to confront the leaders of the ghoul uprising.
