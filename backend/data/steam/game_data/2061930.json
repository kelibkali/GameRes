    "description": "Survive a continuous onslaught of monstrous hordes. Resurrect the heroes they have slain, who refused to join them. Hunt down Baalzebub, defeat his minions, explore the depths of his dungeon, and destroy the Amulet of Yendor, lest it trap more mortals in its thrall.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe gameplay borrows from various other bullet hell and broken build games, primarily NetHack, SNKRX, and Vampire Survivors. The item system is more loot-focused. With a 3D skill tree, a wide range of collectable characters for each run, and synergetic abilities for your resurrected ghostly followers, every run can be drastically different. Some combinations will lead to success........ Others to your deathly essence being scattered.",
