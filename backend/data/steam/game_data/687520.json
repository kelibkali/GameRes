    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Realm Quest was a free online role-playing game designed by and built for us </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >I took a hiatus from all social media and developing the game after losing the job I had and catching my partner at the time cheating on me. Lost most of my friends after calling her out, the rest slowly stopped talking with me over the years. By the time Covid hit, I didn't really have anyone left in my life to talk with let alone build games for.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >After a few months of being locked inside with no one to share anything with I ended up throwing together a simple chat app using html/nodejs where anyone could meet random strangers with similar interests. It got a lot more traffic than I ever thought it would, and ended up having a lot of fun. That was until a pedophile started spamming adult websites with links to my projects, posting my contact information on social media, and harassing anyone who knew me.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The crazy and mentally unstable is part of life, but this predator has made mine worse by claiming to be me and now I have to deal with random creeps because of it. I've tried to avoid this stalker and keep them away from the community but I can't be asked to keep up with them making new accounts and using bots.<br><br>Nearly everyone that joined the Discord server or posted on the Steam forums would  give me grief or insist I kill myself. Only a few people were interested enough to ask what was going on.     Whenever someone did I'd share the chat logs of them asking children for pictures or videos. Hoped that would stop people from flaming the servers but it's only escalated the situation and made things worse.      </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >It's depressing dealing with people when it's only a reminder no one is interested in me or anything I'm doing, most hate me for something I can't control, and that a pervert harassing kids has more friends and support in this world than I ever will.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >“There is no real ending. It's just the place where you stop the story.” ―Frank Herbert</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >I'm really sorry if there was anyone interested in the game, it was my passion and I would love to share it with others but mental health is far more important.</p>",
