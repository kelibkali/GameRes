Blasting cells causes others to wilt away if you're lucky, but can also cause massive explosions of new cells! Feel the upbeat rhythm energize you as you connect the shapes to unlock cross-shots, tri-shots and T-shots at enemies! Beware of new cell formations as the colors get hotter and the music gets more intense! Race to the top of the leaderboard and beat developer high scores. Challenge your friends! Are you the best cell eradicator in town? Leave your initials to prove it!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1144760/extras/a40fc13b180859695c853dd6bb194d1f.avif?t=1670246015\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Dual-stick shooting<br></li><li>Smash developer high scores on the leaderboard!<br></li><li>Collect powerups for even better blasting power!<br></li><li>Funky techno-synthwave soundtrack<br></li><li>Predictable basic cell formations evolve into uncontrollable coagulations!<br></li><li>Solve open questions about cellular automata?<br></li><li>Color-changing, music crescendoing difficulty curve<br></li><li>Challenge friends and family to trounce your massive high scores<br></li><li>Revel in the beauty of particle effects<br></li><li>Accidentally die while reveling in the beauty of particle effects<br></li><li>Blast unpredictable cells out of this world!</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1144760/extras/a0314dc9cb71f37107ea1d9189626940.avif?t=1670246015\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><br>This game was developed as a student project at DigiPen Institute of Technology and was created for educational purposes only.
