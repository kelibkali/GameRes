    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Meanders Map Pack: Venmire Woods</h2>This pack contains 22 Meanders maps in a ready-to-load Fantasy Grounds Module. Meanders maps are somewhat special by having a built-in repeating entrance/exit point so that no matter whether you put another map on the left, right, above or below, of itself or a different Meander map - the pathways will line up allowing continuous sprawling landscapes and terrains for your adventurers to explore.<br>Venmire Woods features varied Forest-Themed maps for a huge range of encounters. It includes the interior of a Tavern for starting out; an exterior shot of the Tavern, a large selection of Roads/Forestry with various visual and tactical features, a River Crossing with Bridge, Sentry Gates, a small Village, two Temples and a Castle. It also includes two 'Blenders' - special maps that blend the terrain gradually from Forest into other terrains: in this case, Ice or Desert. Use these or the Sentry Gates to mark edges and borders to your map realm - or as the gateway to their next adventure. Mix and match them and other maps in the FG Meanders Map Pack series to create thousands of varied combinations.<br><i>This product includes:</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>13 Forest maps<br></li><li>2 Stone Castle maps<br></li><li>2 Temple maps<br></li><li>Treetops map<br></li><li>Village map<br></li><li>Inn map<br></li><li>2 Blend maps<br></li><li>Map selection image</li></ul>Maps are sized specially for FG at 1350x900 and under 500 kb each to help prevent slow-down during play. The maps are sized to perfectly fit a 50 or 60px grid that you can manually place over the top of the map using Fantasy Grounds. Join the maps in this module together with each other, with other modules in this series, use a single map or use a combination of Time-lapse, Role-play and/or the supplied weighted Random Roll Table to determine when maps are used and where adventurers end up next.<br>DM Convenience is the focus with several ways to access, use and choose the maps in this module. Use the VISUAL MAP SELECTION PANEL and pick your map from the thumbnails and yellow label by clicking on the pin. Or use the RANDOM ROLL TABLE - a d100 table to pick your destination at random Or open Images/Maps tab to bring up a list of the maps labelled with a heading in [CAPITALS] and a brief description of each map so that you can quickly identify different files in this module, maps from this module and identify this module from others even if you have other FG meander modules open.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong></strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and any ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
