That’s why we’re giving total customization of where you want your house located (by the sea, in the mountains, in the city) and how you want to build it (exterior or interior) – the choice is yours! If you feel like an experienced farmer, try growing a vegetable garden that can be sold for money to buy new armor, weapons or items to decorate your home. Alternatively, use your harvest to craft magic potions, food, and other inventory that will be key to take on your next voyage!<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1389520/extras/dd600b7c3acc01a51f2b2307ffb02241.poster.avif?t=1699982601\" width=610 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1389520/extras/dd600b7c3acc01a51f2b2307ffb02241.webm?t=1699982601\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1389520/extras/dd600b7c3acc01a51f2b2307ffb02241.mp4?t=1699982601\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Conquer The Biggest Of Castles</h2>Ever wonder what it feels like to be a conqueror, a king, or a leader of a great guild? You’ll be happy to know that the lands of Cinderstone are thriving with castles that have yet to be conquered. Do so by leading your guild to glory by taking control of giant castles, then turn it into your own living-breathing territory with taxes, buffs, and upgrades for the city or outposts. Based on your actions, the people will love you or hate you for the tyrant you can become. Just remember – don’t make too many enemies, otherwise other guilds are going to come knock down your walls and conquer your territory for themselves.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1389520/extras/4e7e1028e495badd688f259daa85b622.poster.avif?t=1699982601\" width=610 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1389520/extras/4e7e1028e495badd688f259daa85b622.webm?t=1699982601\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Built On A “Caravan System”</h2>You’ll be able to choose from a variety of roles, each having a direct impact on the way you play the game. The roles you can choose from are plenty, with the main ones being a trader, a guardian, or a thief. As you journey across distant lands and travel from city to city with your wagon, you can buy crops from other players or sell the fruits of your garden. But be careful – the more valuable goods you bring, the harder your journey will be, with thieves on the lookout to steal anything they can get their hands on. <br>Other players can turn into thieves as well, waiting to attack and steal your precious cargo, then selling it on the black market. That’s why it’s always best if you leave with a big load, you’ll want to seek outside help from other “guardian” players who will protect you at all costs, as long as they get a percentage of your sales. This is one example of many of just how dynamic and exciting the Cinderstone Online universe can be.",
