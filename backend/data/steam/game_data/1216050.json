Your long term relationship came to a less than peaceful ending, you realise you've not been making time for your friends and you are still stuck in the same small portside town you grew up in.<br />\r\nAs if things weren't already bad enough, this week you will be confronted with the news that the world will soon end, You and everyone you know will cease to be. With the limited time you have left you must decide which of the town's folk to try and help, hurt or just spend time with.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n• 18 characters to interact with each with their own personality and story<br />\r\n• Segmented story with multiple endings that is impossible to see in a single playthrough<br />\r\n• Plenty of variations and secrets to be found<br />\r\n• A simple to use binary choice system that can lead to vastly different ends",
