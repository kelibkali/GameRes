    "description": "<strong>Witchball</strong> is a post-reality racing game played by children in the year 2601. Massive environmental change has made much of the world inaccessible, and long-distance travel impossible. Communities are isolated, but communication has advanced to the point where short distances between people barely exist at all.<br><br>In Witchball, two players compete in a high speed foot-race while simultaneously playing a 2D pong-like ball game on the surface of the screen. Points are gained in both aspects and tallied per lap, so it’s important -- and tricky -- to manage the space better than the opponent.<br><br><strong>** LOCAL MULTI-PLAYER ONLY **</strong><br><br><strong>FEATURES:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 1v1 Competitive Racing (Two XBOX controllers recommended, keyboard works though!)<br></li><li> Challenging volleyball-like gameplay -- play on both you <i>and your opponent's </i>cameras!<br></li><li> Four different courses with varying modes, for a total of 9 Tracks<br></li><li> 8 Different Special Abilities</li></ul><br>~*~<br><br><i>Originally used for fishing, glass buoys became associated with witches during witch-hunts in the late 1600s. Traditionally, a ‘witch ball’ is a glass orb hung in a home to ward away bad or evil spirits. The act of play, and games by extension, can function in a similar way -- kind of like a respite from the darkness. Games won’t solve any problems, and neither will a ward, but safeguards and rest are necessary parts of life and games can provide that. A game as a ward, not an escape.</i><br><br><strong>Have fun!</strong><br><br>________________________________________<br><br>&gt;&gt; Made in GameMaker Studio 1.4 <br>&gt;&gt; If you find yourself having framerate issues, switch to 1280x800 resolution -- very high resolutions (like retina screens) give my graphics a hard time!<br>________________________________________",
