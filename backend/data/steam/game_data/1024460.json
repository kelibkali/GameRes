    "description": "This simulator will allow you to destroy a small (really huge) building. But you will do it with epic explosions that will demolish everything in its path.<br>You will be given a choice of different shells with different firepower, but take care using them.<br><br><strong>Weaponry</strong><br>Tired of all this explosions? Use earthquake, tornado, different cannonballs or even blackhole...<br>Hmm found it boring - change its power. Each gun has custom parameters that can be changed.<br><br>Set timer on all charges and watch them explode one by one at 1 button press<br><br><strong>Gravity</strong><br>Took it all from freezing time... Well, play with low / high gravity or just turn it off like you are in space ;)<br><br><strong>Fire system</strong><br>Of course wood burns! Why wouldn't it? XD<br><br><strong>Maps</strong><br>Play over 50 built-in maps<br>Create one yourself as well in the editor!<br>Pick any terrain you want to play on: Sand, Grass, Moon or <strong>Destructible terrain</strong><br><br><strong>Gameplay</strong><br>Full control of gameplay -  fly as a ghost player or switch to a physical body, slow down the time freeze it, change gravity, increase debris amount and enable additional debris effect, increase/reduce objects HP or the force they hold to each other, and much more...",
