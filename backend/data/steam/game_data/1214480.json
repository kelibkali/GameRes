She was designed by Sane and built in Brest in 1792.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >History</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This sturdy ship is famous for bravely fighting three British ships of the line (HMS Victory, HMS Temeraire and HMS Tonnant) during the battle of Trafalgar, under the command of Captain Lucas.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Redoubtable was one of the focal points of the battle, closely engaging Victory and eventually causing the mortal wound which took Admiral Horatio Nelson's life.  At one point in the battle, Redoutable had almost boarded Victory and only the intervention of Temeraire saved the British Flagship. She was then engaged in a gun battle with Victory, Temeraire, and eventually Tonnant. As a result of being engaged by three British ships, the mighty Redoubtable was eventually subdued with only 99 men from her crew of 690 still fit. If every Allied ship had fought like Redoubtable, the outcome of the Battle of Trafalgar may have been very different. Captain Lucas was presented with the Legion of Honour by Napoleon for his conduct. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You now can sail the beautiful Redoutable in Naval Action.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>About premium consumable vessels.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Premium ships cannot be captured by players or traded.
