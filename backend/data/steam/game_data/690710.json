    "description": "This software is a compilation that includes the arcade version of Heiankyo Alien which was a big hit in 1980, and two other arranged versions.<br><br>Contents of the compilation are as follows.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >1. Arcade version</h2>It is a ported version of the original arcade version of Heiankyo Alien.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >2. Heiankyo Alien 3671</h2>This is the first arranged version of Heiankyo alien which added a significant change in the gameplay. You have infinite lives before time runs out, as this game is 5 minute long score attack (With up to 90 seconds time extention depending on the items you dig).<br><br>By killing a certain number of aliens earn items that give you advantages. There is also a diamond buried somewhere in the field which doubles the score. On top of that, recover all buried items for special bonus. <br>In addition to explosive score growth and psychedelic graphics, game effects reflect game development and give you different sense of exhilaration.<br><br>The arcade version was more of a game to &quot;defend&quot;, but this version has more emphasis on &quot;attack&quot;.<br>Music is composed by Wing☆, who admires Yuzo Koshiro as his master, and Ibojima, a Swedish Techno/Trance unit. Gorgeous music will produce the sense of exhilaration in game play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >3. Glitch Encore Alien</h2>In Heiankyo Alien 3671, I implemented a feature that existed in TK-80BS version, but not in the arcade due to hardware limitations. Later a bug was discovered that will let you score explosively. This bug was fixed and 3671 was released, but since this bug has no other negative effect other than scoring, I decided to include this bug as part of the specification to make it as a separate version.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >4. Idle version</h2>A Collaboration version with Guildoll, &quot;2.5 dimension figure idols who want to be loved&quot;, a goal is set at each level for you to advance. With a theme song, each member of the group has a different scenario and the game play is also completely differently arranged from &quot;Heiankyo Alien 3671&quot;.<br><br>In the following update, there will be five members at the end. (Every member will have a different scenario / mission.) This version is planned to implement the full voice acting of each member.",
