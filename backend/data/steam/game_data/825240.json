By purchasing this game you would help me continue creating <strong>more and better games</strong> (which would be <strong>awesome</strong>). I’d love to hear from you, so please contact me through Twitter if you find something wrong in the game, or just want to say hello.<br>I hope you enjoy the game.<br><i>Alex Zaragoza</i>",
