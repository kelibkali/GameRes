You play as a young man who dares to take on tricky building that will challenge all of your skills and craft. In competition with other players you'll earn experience and points which you can use to rise up in ranks and earn trophies.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/625220/extras/fcd8af4b088b8f36e939d4e5151f55d3.avif?t=1512352525\" width=378 height=284 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >BUILDINGS</h2>At first the buildings are easy to rebuild. But the deeper you get into the game, the more demanding the buildings will be and the bulkier the blocks will be. Only true master builders will be able to overcome all of these challenges.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/625220/extras/437efc6e5ac8f80d5c96067eb28cfdde.avif?t=1512352525\" width=378 height=284 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >CONSTRUCTION PLANS</h2>The blueprint of the current level is always visible in the background. This is the required state of the building to allow it to be approved. The plan also shows how the coloured blocks should be positioned. At easy difficulty this plan is only a rough outline, it allows some deviations at positioning the blocks. On the other side there's the hard difficulty: here the building has to fit the plan exactly. Both the position and the colour patterns have to match.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/625220/extras/346af2bfd3245f1f9089174ca0182b50.avif?t=1512352525\" width=378 height=284 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >THE BLOCKS</h2>The blocks of Building blocks come in many different shapes and colors. This diversity of blocks renders every newly achieved building a intriguing experience. Handles and weights differ from block to block. Movable and fixed blocks, simple and complex shapes, columns, letters and varying materials such as wood and stone will make every building a challenge.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/625220/extras/894ba4ea8b6bec969c1e8e1f2ae66b29.avif?t=1512352525\" width=676 height=482 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/625220/extras/343d5886568dd883fecd6dc51c494c1f.avif?t=1512352525\" width=600 height=450 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >BLOCK HANDLING</h2>Every block has differing qualities that require different handling. Complex shaped blocks and sometimes strange gravity change the handling of some blocks, making the construction of some buildings even more challenging. The whole game is played using the PC mouse. You grab a block exactly at that position by clicking on it with the left mouse button. But the block still obeys gravity! Aside from the grabbed place the block will continue falling and swinging. You have to take the block's shape and mass into account before trying to move it.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/625220/extras/fa8b140f10256ec77ede4a38c4451b1a.avif?t=1512352525\" width=378 height=284 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Game Mode</h2> <strong>NORMAL GAME</strong><br>A normal game is played without time measurement. Just tinker with the blocks and enjoy experimenting. Unfortunately you're not allowed to enter the highscore lists in this mode.<br><strong>TIMED GAME</strong><br>In this game mode you're playing against the time. Try to solve the level before time runs out. Outstanding performances are able to enter the highscore list!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/625220/extras/fd43e82d9ac036d10b5f1d3b38ad6f79.avif?t=1512352525\" width=378 height=284 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >CREATE A PLAYER</h2>If there's no player yet you should click on &quot;Create player&quot;. A new window opens which allows you to enter your name. After clicking on &quot;Accept&quot; the new player now shows up in the player list. You start the game with a simple click at the desired player name. To delete a player you need to right-click it.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/625220/extras/fc9417e535e40a3b5333c16e5bcd69f4.avif?t=1512352525\" width=200 height=253 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/625220/extras/51abc41bc4e8823e2131d296c56dd699.avif?t=1512352525\" width=378 height=284 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >MAP</h2>A beautiful map of Ancient Egypt shows all the various buildings.

Only the finished buildings and the current building are shown at the map.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/625220/extras/341a06b462187cf1b0ba5dbb8b2d0415.avif?t=1512352525\" width=378 height=284 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/625220/extras/005c54803d2befa323122d3061726d53.avif?t=1512352525\" width=600 height=480 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >TROPHIES</h2>The qualities coming with a received trophy hold true for all buildings in the whole game.
