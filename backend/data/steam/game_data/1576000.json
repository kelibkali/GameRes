    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story</h2>After an unfortunate mini golf accident (which led to your immediate demise) you wake up in purgatory.  <br>This is not the classical purgatory that we've all read about, but instead it's a game show where the winners get to ascend and the losers get to spend an eternity moderating online forums without any kind of monetary compensation or worse.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About the game</h2>Pain Party combines that madness of a party game with the mechanics of a souls like and precision jumping. <br>You can either play PvP with up to 24 players or play offline in the single player mode, where you have to beat levels to unlock further progression.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay</h2><br><strong>Stamina management and Item usage</strong><br>The first thing you need to learn is that everything in pain party costs stamina, from jumping, punching, dodging, to even using items.<br><br>If you run out of stamina you won't be able to do any of that above and you'll also walk slower so keep a close eye on that stamina meter.<br><br>There a lot of ways to get the upper hand in Pain Party, spawn-able items are one such thing.<br>You might find anything from blunderbusses to time stopping hour glasses.<br><br><strong>Leveling and weapons</strong><br>After each completed level the player will gain experience points. These points can be used to level up your character. Giving him more speed and stamina. <br><br><strong>Precision jumping</strong><br>Jumping in Pain Party isn't like in other games. Holding the jump button will make you do high but short jumps, while tapping the jump button will make you do long horizontal jumps.<br><br><strong>Progress and unlock</strong><br>Winning multiplayer matches and progressing in story mode will help you unlock skins for your character.<br><br><strong>Co-op Survival mode</strong><br>If you get tired of beating your friends in multiplayer you can always join in the wave based survival mode. <br>You can also play it in single player if you feel that you're skilled enough to take on hordes of enemies all alone.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1576000/extras/ede9ed70776585b49e291bda5cf4556f.poster.avif?t=1749320194\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1576000/extras/ede9ed70776585b49e291bda5cf4556f.webm?t=1749320194\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1576000/extras/ede9ed70776585b49e291bda5cf4556f.mp4?t=1749320194\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Unique visual style</strong><br>Choose between three different visual styles.
