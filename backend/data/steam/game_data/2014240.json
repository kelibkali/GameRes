The mayor of Lymph City has been murdered at a prestigious event where the only attendees were fellow immune cells. To find the killer, an investigator from the outside needs to be brought in. Take on the role of a jaded immune cell detective named Dan Dendrick, tasked with rooting out this murderer and putting the minds at ease in Lymph City.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this neo-noir narrative, you will sort through the evidence, talk to witnesses, prepare and develop photos to narrow the field of suspects.",
