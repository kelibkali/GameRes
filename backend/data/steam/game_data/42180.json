They are inspired by famous levels found in legendary NES titles and carry names such as It’s a me, Hamilton! and Dungeon #9.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Accompanying the levels are brand new and shiny achievements to ensure that your bragging rights are properly boosted as well.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
