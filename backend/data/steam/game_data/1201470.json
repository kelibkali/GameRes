    "description": "Solar Baron is a real-time tycoon resource management and logistics game. The game is set in a seamless, randomly-generated solar system with a range of resources to gather, pump and mine for maximum profit.<br><br>The world faces a resource shortage. In desperation, the world government has privatized the under-performing global space agency in the hope that profit-driven individuals will find a way to tap the vast amount of resources available on other worlds and deliver them back home.<br><br>You are one such profit-driven individual.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >LIFE-SIZED SOLAR SYSTEM</h2>Solar Baron features a vast, life-sized solar system of procedurally generated planets and moons. You’ll need to solve the logistical challenges associated with transporting tons of valuable resources across billions of kilometers of space by constructing a network of strategically-placed orbital and surface depots.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1201470/extras/26722e7885b1a230f686c98e97cf143e.poster.avif?t=1667837914\" width=600 height=240 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1201470/extras/26722e7885b1a230f686c98e97cf143e.webm?t=1667837914\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1201470/extras/26722e7885b1a230f686c98e97cf143e.mp4?t=1667837914\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >SPACECRAFT AND SPACEPORT DESIGN</h2>Research new technologies and design spacecraft capable of carrying out specific missions. With a range of available engines, fuel types, and other components, you will be challenged with designing spacecraft that strike a balance between maintenance requirements, production time, mass and – of course – cost.<br><br><br>Design spaceports from a range of modules to serve as fuel depots, research stations, tourist destinations or any combination of these.

However, you don't need to figure out the gritty details yourself – you pay people to do that for you. The game features a streamlined mission design system, which will calculate every detail of a spacecraft's mission from a list of actions to perform created by the player. This leaves you to do more important things: creating a strategy, setting goals, planning missions and watching the bottom line.",
