    "description": "Follow the touching story of a medieval knight that is having bad luck in finding its princess.<br />\r\nThis is a story based platform game. You will need to use arrow keys to move the knight towards the exit of each level. At the exit of a level there is a door that will open and where the knight hopes that the princess that he is waiting for a long time, is there.<br />\r\nThe path towards exit is not easy. Some levels are quite big. There will be spikes that obviously will kill you. Expect to find also moving blades that follow a predefined pattern. Also the castles you explore are not inhabited by humans so bats will be there. For a strange reason the knight is afraid of bats. However you have a sword that you can use to kill them.<br />\r\nBut don't worry there will be moving platform that you need to use to reach some places. <br />\r\nSometimes you will find diamonds inside the castle. I think you need to collect them. Your princess will surely like diamonds.",
