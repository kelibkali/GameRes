Fly to the skies and take the gameplay vertical as you control the ball in the air to blast it down into your opponent’s goal.<br><br>- <strong><u>Shooting:</u></strong> With 5 different weapon types, control play your way.<br>From precise, fast control to powerful close range mega blasts, a deep weapon type combo system adds new depth and challenge to soccer control. <br><br>- <strong><u>Ammo:</u></strong> A dynamic ammo system constantly forces teams into an attack - defence style, where tactical shots can mean the difference between relegation or promotion. Go all out in an intense firing barrage before dashing back for a tactical defence.<br><br>- <strong><u>Soccer-Inspired Mechanics:</u></strong> Controllable goalkeepers allow you to defend from afar and remove the need to sit in goal, attack as a team and defend on the move.<br>Environmental mechanics add a new layer to gameplay. Use corner bumpers to instantly set up powerful cross shots or block off your opponent’s advance with player-controlled barricades forcing gameplay into the air.<br><br>- <strong><u>Intense Competitive Leaderboards:</u></strong> Constantly-updating competitive leaderboards with weekly promotion and relegation brackets, challenge the world and your friends to see who can claim division glory and call themselves Axiom Soccer champion. <br><br>- <strong><u>Constantly evolving game:</u></strong> Developed alongside our growing Discord community, Axiom Soccer is constantly updated and improved with the feedback of our players. <br>Join our Discord at  and talk directly to the development team.",
