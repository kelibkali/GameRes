The guy infested has to kill everyone else. The other guys have to find who is The Thing and kill him. They can also escape map at the end of the timer if they have found keys to open one or more doors !<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 6 Maps<br></li><li> More Than 10 Different Weapons<br></li><li> The Thing has his own special abilities : he can smell others, buries himself awazy, spread a slowing gel on others,</li></ul><br>It may have minor corrections in gameplay so any feedback is welcome !",
