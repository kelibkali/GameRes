    "description": "This project is a mix of horror and crafting genres. The whole game fits into a week of the life of a little Russian girl. Every day the character must make a particular magic ritual, using the materials at hand. At the same time, the player must control the activity of otherworldly and hostile forces. The girl should periodically look in the mirrors, which are distracting from her task. The movement of evil spirits of the apartment is visible only in reflections. But what happens if the spirit gets too close?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn ordinary schoolgirl from an ordinary Russian town just wants to be loved. Petya is a good boy but does not take the hints. What all those young communist magazines teach you? You can do everything yourself. Just grab together nails, blood, rat entrails, fire, death, add skillful hands and a jigsaw -- and you can make love at home. Help Masha find her true love and her destiny.",
