    "description": "<strong>Speakerman is a retro-styled experience themed after 80’s MS-DOS PC games, featuring puzzle-platforming, exploration and collect-a-thon gameplay elements. It features classic CGA graphics (with a twist) and classic PC Speaker sounds mixed with modern music.</strong><br><br>From the start you can pick either Open World Mode or Story Mode. The Open World Mode offers non-engaging fun during which you can listen to podcasts or music without being fully distracted, though should you delve deep into it there’s plenty to find and unlock, including difficult-to-discover easter eggs. Story Mode offers a challenging and thought-provoking platforming experience, and is recommended for experienced gamers who have played Open World Mode for at least a few hours.",
