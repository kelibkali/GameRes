I run the simulated worlds for weeks, waiting for evolution to happen. I implemented Steam Workshop support, so you don't have to! Some Workshop Items are not just a simple savefiles, but sequences of savefiles! Download the sequence and use the in-game &quot;savefile list&quot; feature, so you can step evolutionary time forward by weeks with one click!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Demo</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >I am just a solo dev, I could test the simulation on an RX 6750 XT, a GT 710 and an NVS 4200M. To remedy this issue I want to provide a free demo you can try out, to check if the game works on your machine. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Please make sure you have the newest drivers installed for your graphics card.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Demo limitations:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Only the smallest world size is available</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >No DNA editing</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >No Steam Workshop access</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Lore</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > For this simulation my vision was to simulate a whole ecosystem of cells. There are many grid-like simulations, where artificial life exists in a grid. There are many game-like simulations where whole creatures are simulated. Sadly none of these fills the niche I am interested in. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >I am specifically interested in the boundary of single celled and multicellular life. How did multicellular life come to be? How cells work together as an organism? How many ways can multicellularity evolve? There are only theories as the answer lies in the un-fossilized past.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >To achieve this I simulate individual cells, and their individual organelles. I do not want to force multicellularity by having dedicated types of cells. Each cell can perform multiple things, can decide which organelles to grow. I want single celled life to be just as feasible and diverse as multicellular. I want the local environment to decide how the most successful life form should look like.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This simulator is my pet project, 10 years in the making! It is running entirely on the video card. You don't need a supercomputer, just a mid range card to simulate hundreds of thousands of cells. The world in the trailer is the result of running the simulation on my RX 6750 XT for a week. Hopefully the advancement of video cards makes even bigger worlds a possibility!</p>",
