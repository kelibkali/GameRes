    "description": "A mysterious alien civilization is watching you on TV, studying and judging everything you do. Progress through the ranks and reap the rewards. Make it to the rank of Grand Champion and you'll even get a single wish granted. What will you wish for? Wealth? Power? Freedom?<br><br>An action RPG at heart, Crossedland also has elements from several other genres mixed in. You’ll teleport into arenas to battle, gather, loot, and hunt then retire to your personal island for rest. You can bring back people you find and rebuild the ruins scattered across the island, unlocking new features, equipment, recipes, and upgrades as you go.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2060580/extras/ed783752ef7c3e6a2a7d3377a8ad830b.webp?t=1726671426\" width=618 height=40 /></span>    <br>Combat can best be described as souls-lite. It can be fast paced but is also methodical at times. It can also be very difficult if you’re not careful. Enemies (especially humanoid enemies) are incredibly deadly at most levels if you don’t pay attention to them.<br><br>There are currently over 100 weapons to find or craft and 18 different fighting styles based on the weapons you use. From one-handed swords, quick thrusting weapons, and polearms to massive, slow two-handed weapons and bows.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2060580/extras/568969b0581bf3d61f0e7f7ff3a40081.poster.avif?t=1726671426\" width=614 height=346 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2060580/extras/568969b0581bf3d61f0e7f7ff3a40081.webm?t=1726671426\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2060580/extras/568969b0581bf3d61f0e7f7ff3a40081.mp4?t=1726671426\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>More powerful enemies also await when you find the coordinates to boss locations.

Many of them will be open, sprawling areas, that can be several different biomes, where you’ll primarily gather resources to rebuild your island and create new gear and tech. These large arenas will also be full of enemies, too, so watch your back while you’re gathering resources.<br><br><strong>If you die in the arena, you’ll lose everything you gathered in that arena. So, be careful if you’re low on health and see that shiny gold node off in the distance.</strong><br><br>Other arenas include cramped quarter combat arenas where your goal will just be to defeat the enemy and gameshows. Gameshows range from easy to complete to incredibly difficult but can have wonderful rewards.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2060580/extras/8ffbc7e69d8385818e34a6a1fa066e70.poster.avif?t=1726671426\" width=614 height=346 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2060580/extras/8ffbc7e69d8385818e34a6a1fa066e70.webm?t=1726671426\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2060580/extras/8ffbc7e69d8385818e34a6a1fa066e70.mp4?t=1726671426\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Arenas feature time limits.

Most weapon styles have their own skills (some overlap) then each gathering type and crafting type have their own skills as well as a few others like athletics.<br><br>Skills are raised by using them. Raising your skills is important as the higher your skill, the more damage you do, the faster you gather, and the better you craft. <br><br>Hitting certain skill levels also unlocks one of the 32 abilities available in the game.
