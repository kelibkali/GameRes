Severing that old human head has freed RUNE II and it is now a glorious Viking adventure. <br><br>In this journey to open the ultimate can of whoopass on Loki and save Midgard, you’ll need heavy weapons, raucous friends, and lots and lots of mead.

Battle savage hordes of enemies from Norse legends alone or online with friends.
