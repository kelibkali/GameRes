    "description": "The rules of engagement are simple; If they are armed: OPEN FIRE. Unleash a deadly array of weapons from a convoy of the creme of the modern American military. This time don't worry about running out of ammo, instead worry about saving your own skin! The cities and towns around you hide a fierce and fanatical enemy. Come face to face with the deadliest of traps; Improvised explosives!  At anytime civilian vehicles around you can become vehement bombers, Roadside rubble hiding enough explosives to mangle and destroy most modern machines. When you aren't directly engaging leftover cold war tanks and APCs, armed forces with RPG's dive out to meet you. The AK-47 remains a staple and releases a constant barrage of fire from all sides. Switch freely between vehicles and their many mounted weapons and engage the enemy with true arcade-turret style gameplay. 360 degrees to experience a vision of battle, of dire conflict as it plays out in the digital desert.
