Step into an enchanted room where books may wink at you, claws may grab your attention and innocent cups of tea may lure you into beautiful, secret gardens.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Lost Sunday Comics presents The Lost Sunday</strong></h2><i>Nina lives in a dusty town, haunted by the six angry wolves of the week -  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Each day brings never-ending chores, and no one can rest until they are  done. <br><br>Legend speaks of a seventh, kinder wolf, but everybody knows an evil witch stole it and keeps it locked away. But Nina has had enough, so she sets on an  ambitious quest - go to the forgotten realms, vanquish the witch, bring back Sunday and enough free time for everyone. </i><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1600220/extras/3b68219777d848425156d79fb6ccde9b.avif?t=1675690790\" width=616 height=300 /></span><br><br><strong>The Lost Sunday</strong> is a comic book about working too much, told through stories and inspiration from old folklore, myths and tales.
