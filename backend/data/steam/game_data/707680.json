    "description": "Slapshot is an online multiplayer game where you and 5 other players play a game of hockey. The game is physics-based, so teamwork and crisp passing are essential to win. Play with your friends or team up with other Slapshot players!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Free-to-Play</h2>Slapshot is free-to-play indefinitely. You can buy the Slappy Pass in order to unlock all of the customization options you've earned to make your character stand out!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Controls</h2>You control your own player's movements with WASD and a mouse. Use the mouse to swing your stick and control the puck. Trackpads work, but a mouse is absolutely recommended.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About the Devs</h2>Slapshot is a hobbyist project consisting of three developers: two software engineers and a designer/artist.
