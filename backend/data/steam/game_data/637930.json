    "description": "Command powerful forces of nature to free an island of an evil scourge! As you and a band of brave warriors make your way across a once lost land, you'll restore its villages, free its people and battle ogres, golems and Yeti scum. Your ultimate destination: the volcano at the heart of the island and the wicked dragon that lives within it. To make it that far, you'll use the sun, rain, wind and more to reshape the land to your bidding. With the elements in your hands, a sword at your side and a little magic in your pocket, no one will be able to stop you on your march to victory!",
