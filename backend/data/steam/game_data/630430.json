    "description": "This historical campaign is set during the early stage of the Stalingrad battle when the German XIV Panzer Corps breached through to the Volga River and the Luftwaffe unleashed all of its might on the civilian districts and defense lines of the city. To compensate for the heavy losses the 8th Air Army suffered during the Summer, Soviet High Command started to move all available reserves, including air regiments and air defense forces personnel to the Stalingrad area in the middle of August. You will be the second-in-command squadron officer of the 11th IAP (fighter regiment) that just arrived at the front line, in the thick of the unraveling air battle. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Timeframe: August 28th - September 13th, 1942.<br></li><li>Regiment: 11th IAP 268th IAD <br></li><li>Available aircraft: Yak-1 series 69<br></li><li>Duration: 15 missions<br></li><li>Average playtime: 5 hours</li></ul>",
