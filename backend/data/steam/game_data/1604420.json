Deep down. Into the void.<br>It is hard to move. And every move you make makes your next move even harder...<br>In this world you are going to fall. And then die. And then fall again. Faster.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay</h2>This game is a reversed platformer. In the sense that your goal is not to jump on platforms, but to avoid them. <br>You are going to fall down. How deep? Depends on your decisions. How fast? Depends on your actions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Your every action increases falling speed. So, moving much makes further actions harder<br></li><li> Platforms can move, change form, appear and disappear, fall from above, follow you, etc<br></li><li> Character can charge before making a move. The more precise charging was, the less additional moves you have to make to avoid next obstacle</li></ul>",
