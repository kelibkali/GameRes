    "description": "In <strong>Battlemage Training</strong> you are an aspiring Battlemage. Practice swinging your war wand with speed and precision, with the help of your mentor.<br><br>The goal of this game was to put some weight into VR melee fights, with an fun original concept. Your weapon is detached from your controller and requires timing and skill to achieve some destruction.<br><br>In the current release there is a single game mode, focusing on timing and precision. This is a test of skill, with sets of targets that you hit with you weapon, in order to score points. But be careful. If you are not fast enough, then your targets will hit you back.",
