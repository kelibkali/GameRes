    "description": "In this turn based RPG for Windows you play as a young mercenary and travel from soul to soul to avenge your fiance and her family. While finding a way to change the flow of past events, you will encounter many obstacles and meet new allies. Will you be brave enough?<br><br>This game aims to revive nostalgic moments for good old RPG fanatics (such as Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 3...). Our game has no game over screen; once the hero dies, his soul is sent to the underworld, to meet the Soul Giver. At this point, it is possible to re-embody a new body (therefore several choices of classes: Warrior, Assassin, Mage, Hunter ...). In addition, once a character masters a technique, it is learned permanently in the mind of the hero. It is therefore possible to transfer a warrior's ability to a magician. This leads toward interesting gameplay combinations.<br><br>What makes the game unique and fun to play:<br>- Dark, mysterious and ever-changing storyline<br>- Unique class &amp; death system<br>- High replay value.<br>- Various treasure hunting.<br>- Easy crafting system<br><br>If you are a fan of old good RPG games, this one is surely for YOU!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/311000/extras/152ccd0e1239361f9e7b46c561ed262a.avif?t=1599963192\" width=150 height=150 /></span>",
