    "description": "<strong>WARIUM is a turn-based strategy for creating your empire.</strong><br><br>The WARIUM world is a procedurally generated hexagonal map that consists of different biomes. Who knows where you will start your journey. Maybe it will be a cold and empty tundra or a fertile and impassable jungle?<br><br>Units capture cells and expand your empire, but be careful: the extended power is easier to crush into smaller ones! Units do not have health, but there is a force parameter. A strong unit can destroy a weaker unit. So hold back the onslaught of the numerous, but weak army of your enemy.<br><br>Recruit and upgrade units, build buildings and raise your economy. You are free to choose in which direction to expand your power.<br><br>Game process:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Sandbox.<br></li><li>The world is created by chance.<br></li><li>The world consists of islands that are connected to each other by teleports.<br></li><li>The world is shrouded in biomes, which differ not only in landscape and fertility, but also in the initial densely populated areas.<br></li><li>Up to 30 states can appear on a small field. And up to 900 in the big world.<br></li><li>You start playing in the village.<br></li><li>To capture the cells, the unit must stand on it.<br></li><li>Units gain experience when capturing enemy cells, after which the units can be improved.<br></li><li>Build economic and defensive structures.<br></li><li>In the game there are several types of units: swordsmen, lancers, cavalry, long-range.<br>     Spearmen are good against cavalry, but weak before swordsmen and long-range.<br></li><li>Units contain several branches of upgrade.<br></li><li>Discover the world - find tactically advantageous areas of the terrain, fertile cells.<br></li><li>If the territory of the state is crushed and ceases to connect with the capital, then it has its own capital and its treasury.<br></li><li>To win, you must destroy all enemy states.</li></ul><br><strong>Choose your faction and go ahead.</strong>",
