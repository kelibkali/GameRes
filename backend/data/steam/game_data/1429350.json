Three flight physics modes, three difficulty modes, and a tutorial mode provide a stepped learning curve and wider accessibility to realistic helicopter flight.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >THE SCENARIO: </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > <br>The National Laboratory has been studying all kinds of crazy biological &quot;tools&quot;, and now it's under invasion. If any of that research gets captured, or worse, some sort of vector gets out, it could be the start of a happy new world. For zombies. For us, it would be quite inconvenient. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Perform aerial interdiction against the relentless Commies, using an increasingly sophisticated arsenal of weaponry from your Multi-Mission Helicopter (MH), callsign Zombie 26. If zombies were to somehow result from your failure to fight off the invasion, and the zombies were to escape, all hope of containment would be lost, so fly like your life depends on it (SPOILER: It does).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >MH-Zombie is a Sim-Arcade Helicopter Shooter with realistic physics and Arcade tempo. Developed by a former AH-64D Apache pilot, it replicates the best parts of attack helicopter flight in the Killer Egg, while doing away with all the tedious, stressful, and boring bits that are all-too real for IRL gun pilots. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >MH-Zombie has five game modes and several sub-modes: </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >1. Tutorial. Learn how to operate this little MH/AH (Multi-Mission/Attack Helicopter) bird and its systems, and get a crash-course in introductory Rotary-Wing flight. Hard emphasis on 'Crash Course', because if you've never flown a helicopter before, you will crash non-stop for the first ten minutes. But if you give yourself the space to crash and keep trying, you can absolutely learn to fly. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >2. Race. Demonstrate your low-level flight skills by following gates around the map in a timed race. Race has two sub-modes: Pure Race, which pits you against the clock only, and Combat Race mode, which adds enemies to fight along the way at major checkpoints. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >3. Evacuation. Evacuate the civilians still in the area before the invasion arrives, and find and destroy the enemy scouts in the area.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >4. Survival, a tower defense-style setup. Fight off waves of invading enemies and unlock weapons upgrades until the enemies accidentally release a zombie apocalypse, after which you must prevent the zombies from escaping out into the world. This mode has two sub-modes: Sim/Arcade, which increases realism and can be 'won' if you can defeat all enemies, and Arcade/Horde, which cannot be won, and introduces a score multiplier mechanism and less realistic game mechanics such as unlock able turbo mode, instant-reloads, and more. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >5. Marathon, a combination of Evacuation and Sim/Arcade Survival. Evacuate the civilians, and then fight off the invasion.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >All this takes place on three different maps: The Laboratory; a small mountain valley town with a large laboratory complex, The Repository; a small town nestled in a sprawling forested group of hills in the mountains, and The Island; a tropical island with a vague 'je ne sais quoi.'</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >MH-Zombie features robust control customization, with nearly unlimited binding support for joystick/HOTAS, keyboard, mouse, and gamepad, and (newly added) head tracking via UDP over network (opentrack, SmoothTrack etc.)!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >There are three different camera configurations: 1st person, over the shoulder 3rd person, and advanced tag-along 3rd person-follow, which almost gives it a remote-control helicopter feel, and the ability to switch between right and left seat. MH-Zombie features exaggerated horizon and roll-following and robust free-look options, improving immersion and ease-of use.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The graphics quality is highly configurable, allowing the user to carefully craft their experience based on their preferences and the performance of their device.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The base weapons loadout is a 7.62mm minigun, antipersonnel cluster mines, and HEDP rockets. Upgrades include 30mm canon, incendiary rockets, auto-turret mines, ammo capacity increase, flechette rockets, heat-seeking volley mines, and laser-guided missiles. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Hard physics mode simulates main rotor torque effect, translating tendency, and retreating blade stall. Easy physics mode has an adjustable auto-leveling feature, and hard attitude limits that won’t let you completely lose your head. And Medium removes the nanny features of the Easy physics mode without adding the main rotor torque effect and translating tendency of the Hard physics mode.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >KNOWN ISSUES:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Keyboard bindings are for English Language layout; some bindings will not work correctly with other-than English keyboard layouts. However, rebinding is just a few clicks away.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >About the developer: Hey there, I'm Joseph Fernandez, aka Raulboy. I'm not going to pretend like there's some big team here and write in the third person- it's just me. I grew up in the mountains of Montana, with five brothers, three sisters, no running water, and no electricity. I've wanted to fly since before I can remember, and after I graduated from Florence-Carlton high school, I attended the University of Montana on an Army Reserve Officer Training Corps scholarship so that I could become a helicopter pilot. After graduation and commissioning as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Aviation branch, I attended flight school at the United States Army Aviation Center of Excellence, and became an AH-64D Apache pilot. Within a couple months of flight school, I moved to Texas and deployed to Afghanistan as a Platoon Leader, and then a year later, to Kuwait. After attending the Army Aviation Captains Career Course, I spent a year in South Korea as a Staff Captain, then a year and a half in Hawaii as a Troop Commander and then Assistant Brigade Aviation Officer. My next move was to Germany, where I spent four years as a Staff Captain. I was in Germany for the first two years of COVID 19, and in the increased free time that it afforded, I decided to make the video game I always wanted to play, but had never existed. I worked on it for the next two years, moved to Texas for my last assignment in the Army, as a Brigade Aviation Officer, and published MH-Zombie in 2022. In 2023 I resigned my Army Commission and moved back to Montana, where I have continued to add to and improve upon MH-Zombie. I am super proud of this game, and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I've enjoyed making it. If you have any comments or suggestions, do not hesitate to put them in your review, or in the discussion forum for the game on this site. Thanks for your consideration and your support! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >-Joe</p>",
