Be the masta of your sabers and your people. Protect yourself and protect them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Game-play and features</h2>You will appear on an alien spaceship with two energysabers in your hands in deep space somewhere in a faraway galaxy. You can use your energysabers as sabers, shields, or even rail-guns to fight with incoming flying and crawling drones. The drones are coming in waves and you will lose some health every time a drone hits you. The health is restored after each completed wave. In order to complete a wave you need to kill all the drones in it, and each subsequent wave has an increased number of drones. Every drone in a new wave becomes more and more tricky to kill: faster, closer to appear, harder to hit. They can also carry some hidden drones inside and split when you expect that the least.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Physical and mind activities</h2>- 360 arm swings<br>- 180 body rotation<br>- Squats<br>- Dodging lasers<br>- Precision training<br>- Attention exercising<br>- Spaceship walking if you have enough room<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Good luck!</h2>It's a VR deep-space experience.<br>It's a survival game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Discord</h2>Join our Discord server to share your feedback or get a free early adopter promo code:<br><br>",
