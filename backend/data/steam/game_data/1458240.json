    "description": "Mythgard is a journey into a near future world where gods and mythical creatures mix with high technology and magic in a cyberpunk-infused landscape where megacorporations control countries and anything is possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA new collectible card game from the brilliant minds at Rhino Games, Mythgard has been an absolute blast to write for, blending elements of retrofuturist electronics and dark, apocalyptic orchestral writing into what I feel is a unique musical palate with which to paint the captivating world of this brilliant CCG.<br />\r\n~John R Matz<br />\r\nProducer, Mythgard Soundtrack",
