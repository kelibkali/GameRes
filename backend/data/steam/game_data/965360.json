    "description": "<strong>Notice: The game can be played using Mouse+Keyboard and/or in VR (HTC Vive, Oculus Rift).</strong><br><br>Everyone can shoot, but not everyone can gun. In this first-person shooter you will need to fight for your life. You will need to show full awareness in order to fulfil the game goal of finding 12 documents in a procedurally generated level protected by machines that don't even know what mercy is.<br><br>You will be equipped with a weapon and some spare ammunition but be aware that you will definitely need to scavenge for more to fight the machines. To even stand a chance you will have to operate your weapon in full detail. Use the keyboard (keys can be remapped) in the Mouse+Keyboard version. Use motion controllers in the VR version.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><strong>Key features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Ability to play with Mouse+Keyboard and/or in VR (HTC Vive, Oculus Rift)<br></li><li>Procedural generated level with high replayability<br></li><li>Hyper-realistic and detailed weapon mechanics<br></li><li>Simulation of gun malfunctions (failure to eject and double feeds)<br></li><li>Realistic bullet ballistics based on real life formula including bullet drop, bullet travel time and ricochets<br></li><li>Localized sounds for an even more immersive experience<br></li><li>Key remapping (for the Mouse+Keyboard implementation)<br></li><li>More to come</li></ul>",
