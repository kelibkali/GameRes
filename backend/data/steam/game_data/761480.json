    "description": "<strong>Snail Trek - Chapter 3: Lettuce Be</strong> is the third in a series of &quot;20 minute adventures&quot; where you take on the role of a crew of snails on a journey to a new home world.<br><br>In the style of the early Sierra Online adventure games, Snail Trek has colorful <i>EGA-ish</i> graphics and a text parser interface. Relive the nostalgia in these bite-sized adventures - but without all the pain. Autosaves, a text parser with auto-suggest, and puzzles with no dead ends, all combine to bring this old genre into the modern era.<br><br>In Chapter 3, survival is at stake again. But whose survival?<br><br><strong>Key Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Autosaves - no need to save every few minutes (though you still can if you want).<br></li><li> A text parser with both auto-suggest and auto-correct - fat finger your way to puzzle glory (but you can turn them off if you want to suffer more greatly).<br></li><li> A text parser that understands what objects are in front of you, so you can be lazy and just type things like 'get' or 'look'.<br></li><li> CRT emulation mode that gives those pixels an ever-so-slightly fuzzy look.<br></li><li> A stereophonic score.<br></li><li> Cute snails.<br></li><li> Deaths (but hey, autosaves).<br></li><li> No dead ends! Puzzle your way around with impunity!<br></li><li> Widescreen aspect ratio, since monitors are more rectangular now.</li></ul>",
