    "description": "Lost Flame is a modern roguelike game featuring unique and challenging turn-based combat. Explore the ruined kingdom of Hiraeth, fight against legendary warriors of the past and discover the reasons of the cataclysm.<br><br>The game takes lots of inspiration from classical roguelikes and includes stuff such as turn-based, permadeath, lots of procedural content.<br><br>There is a number of features which are something new in the genre, the most important one being a unique take on the turn based combat.<br>Melee combat focuses a lot on positioning and movement, it's not the typical bump into enemy until it dies. <br><br><strong>Dodging attacks</strong><br>Most of the enemy attacks are slow and you can usually dodge them by simply walking away:<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/856570/extras/6757959ce20e943903a0a44966f05416.poster.avif?t=1771414227\" width=216 height=236 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/856570/extras/6757959ce20e943903a0a44966f05416.webm?t=1771414227\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/856570/extras/6757959ce20e943903a0a44966f05416.mp4?t=1771414227\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span> <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/856570/extras/915fad2287c66e1e8685014f29fa7845.poster.avif?t=1771414227\" ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/856570/extras/915fad2287c66e1e8685014f29fa7845.webm?t=1771414227\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br>It's simple at first area or two, but gets more difficult very quickly!<br><br><strong>Big and unique enemies</strong><br>Lost Flame features lots of multitile enemies<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/856570/extras/4663a1fbea01c12c9f90ad6f8b000ec5.avif?t=1771414227\" width=732 height=536 /></span><br>Most of the enemies have some unique traits or abilities and you cannot just apply the same approach to everything you meet.<br><br><strong>Different weapons</strong><br>Depending on which weapon you carry, you have access to, usually, 3 or 4 different special attacks.<br>For example <br><br>with long sword you can slash 3 grid tiles in one turn:<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/856570/extras/d257cc99ff01b3221d338d260e7d8d9c.poster.avif?t=1771414227\" ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/856570/extras/d257cc99ff01b3221d338d260e7d8d9c.webm?t=1771414227\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>with short sword you can lunge - jump one grid and attack in one turn<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/856570/extras/e9785056b9fb9f43f3086bb0bb22582f.poster.avif?t=1771414227\" ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/856570/extras/e9785056b9fb9f43f3086bb0bb22582f.webm?t=1771414227\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>with halberd you can slash around everything in a huge semi-circle<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/856570/extras/6d3b762c18a28f5d1d99aace18583458.poster.avif?t=1771414227\" width=242 height=252 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/856570/extras/6d3b762c18a28f5d1d99aace18583458.webm?t=1771414227\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/856570/extras/6d3b762c18a28f5d1d99aace18583458.mp4?t=1771414227\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>There are also other weapon types, such as spears, greatswords, all kind of axes and maces and a few more.

They are quite plentiful and you can use them almost on any non-consumable item - you can enchant weapons, armor, but also rings, wands and other usable magical items. What you will want to enchant depends on you and there are no clear-cut correct answers here.<br><br><strong>SFX</strong><br>Lost Flame features cinematic music, rich sound effects and recorded voice overs for NPCs.<br><br><strong>Gameplay features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Over 100 hours of content<br></li><li>While the game gets more difficult in the later areas, the earliest areas also require some thinking, you cannot just autopilot through them.<br></li><li>Mistakes are costly - when in combat usually single move, or attack can determine the outcome<br></li><li>Power curve is quite flat - while with proper equipment your character can dish out significant damage, he still remains quite fragile and getting too cocky results in a quick death<br></li><li>There is a small id game - there are unidentified potions and scrolls you can find, however they get identified every time you gain a level.<br></li><li>All attacks consume stamina and if you run out of it, you can no longer use weapon special attacks (you can still use the basic &quot;bump into enemy&quot; attack) and you receive more damage<br></li><li>There is rich lore behind the game world, however it's not &quot;in your face&quot; - if you are interested you can connect the dots about game world from the flavor texts of items and monsters (this one is work in progress, I have the lore and the story all laid out, however there are still lots of flavor texts to be written)</li></ul>",
