    "description": "In Your Realm gives an old-school, challenging, RPG roguelike experience with randomized <br>encounters and a unique combat system.<br>To beat the game the player needs to plow through every weakness of their personality - <br>represented in the game as different bosses in their respective worlds - to finally take on <br>the ultimate challenge.<br><br>In Your Realm is in part a homage to classic titles such as Golden Axe, Mega Man and Zelda: <br>A link to the past, where focus lies on challenging and fun gameplay with <br>good replayability. Each of every one of the hundred of unique monsters in the game offers <br>their own set of attacks and behaviors. Every decent run grants the player rewards to spend<br>to introduce new elements and buffs in the next run. <br>Altogether this makes every play a different experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>100 unique monsters.<br></li><li>Skill tree that evolves based on: spells found, skills aquired, attributes leveled, bosses killed and your playstyle.<br></li><li>Armors and weapons, displayed on the character.<br></li><li>Randomized labyrinth of rooms and encounters/rewards in them.<br></li><li>Characteristics gained by playing in a certain manner. These give specific bonuses/penalties in alignment with that playstyle.<br></li><li>Extra lives when progressing beyond the first boss (in easy and normal difficulties).<br></li><li>Activatable rewards after each decent run.<br></li><li>Diplomas recording your best stats for each difficulty, such as: rooms explored, monsters killed, block% etc.<br></li><li>Monsters fight back! (not mainly hack-n-slash or shoot-n-dodge gameplay)</li></ul>",
