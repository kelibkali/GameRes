Although you will need more plastic to do so...<br><br>▼ Increased Builder Toys<br>With more Builder Toys under your arm, everything is faster; Be that building, breaking objects as a team (increases break speed), or having each go off and destroy their own.<br><br>▼ Plastic Generators<br>Constructing your own Plastic Generators from resources allows you to create plastic every minute, and with the help of an upgrade, that speed can be increased. Create more and more plastic generators to increase the amount every time period. This is important, as plastic is a form of currency. Although this cannot work without the infamous Plastic Converters.<br><br>▼ Plastic Converter<br>These bad boys are basically how you turn the raw plastic into actually usable plastic. Place them in front of plastic generators and instantly witness, for the first time, plastic conversion. <br><br>▼ Trading Posts<br>Trading posts are a great way to gain more resources once you've tuckered yourself out with mining. Place yourself a trading post, and let the resources walk to you... with a price.<br><br>▼ Tents<br>Yes, it is well known in the world that toys don't sleep like us. But, with the amount you are working them, you might as well add that to the lore, because they will need it. More builders can only be made once there are tents added, each tent is an extra builder you can make in the 3D printer.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2017920/extras/16a568b708491ecb1ac8bac6658d76f3.avif?t=1692584216\" width=616 height=100 /></span><br><br>▼ Hiring Toys<br>Yep, you heard that right, with the amount of room in this household, there are so many toys that would be willing to work for you; each having their own abilities and skills, different from the default builders.<br><br>▼ Influence<br>What is the point in destroying a household if no toy notices? Well, no need to worry, the toys in each room notice. Each object destroyed out of the overall amount in the room increases your influence on the surrounding toys. Depending on the toy's view on what you are doing, each will either reject your plan or give you deals on hiring based on your influence.<br><br>▼ Exploration (COMING SOON)<br>Once your toy army is big enough, it is time to leave the bedroom... and enter the vast space of the house. Explore rooms, pull it apart, and become the most feared toys the world has seen.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2017920/extras/54be1b49a4129c468d6695c02768922a.poster.avif?t=1692584216\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2017920/extras/54be1b49a4129c468d6695c02768922a.webm?t=1692584216\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2017920/extras/54be1b49a4129c468d6695c02768922a.mp4?t=1692584216\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
