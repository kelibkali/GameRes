At the beginning of each game, you choose the Hero you want to play, each of them coming with a basic attack, and a capacity that is exclusive to him or her. You also choose four spells that need Halzae's essence, which you pick up in each of the arenas, so that you can fire them. Use them wisely to take down your opponents, and fulfill the objectives of the game! Break the ultimate crystal to unleash extremely powerful spells on all enemies, or heal your allies!<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >CHOOSE YOUR SPELLS</h2></li></ul>At the beginning of the game, you choose your character, who has a basic attack and a specific capacity, and four spells, among all the spells of the game.
