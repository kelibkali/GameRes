    "description": "Formula E has been modified from its original version and now allows play outside of a VR headset and compatible on a fresh install with an Xbox 1 controller. Controls are customizable using the game launchers input tab. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFormula E features a custom, fast paced course that will test your skills as a driver. With the beautiful Boston skyline at your back, hug the turns and race to get your best time. Features a checkpoint system that will allow you to reset your car when you inevitably crash. You will hear the cheer of the crowd and the squeal of your tires. There's nothing like race day!",
