But one day, a huge sword fell from the sky, and those who touched it were sucked into an unknown world. Some of them were able to come back alive, but they were no longer the same. They have a common strong power. And that sim became a focusless or evil man who lost his will to live and attacked others. Since then, the world inside the huge sword has been called the &quot;Cursed Sword World,&quot; and only those who have a strong desire for adventure and power have entered it. <br><br>And now you have fallen here. Would you overcome all the trials and turn your heart into a peaceful place again?
