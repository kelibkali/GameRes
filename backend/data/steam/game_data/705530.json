    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Wizard Hunter 2348 is a far cry from being a bloated open world stealth game. Rather, it is a tightly focused ambush tactics game about constantly creating openings, managing enemy awareness and ruthlessly exploiting their predictable behaviors. A single wizard can gun you down in moments, but with a bit of trickery you can pull a whole mob of them while you run around the corner to slaughter them all from behind.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >If you're not careful, enemies will be alerted by all the bloodshed and summon an endless parade of powerful demons from the summoning circles, making your life much harder.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Play Your Way</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Each of the many maps is complex, with many alternate routes and exploitable features, like gas stoves and welcome mats. There are three playable characters, which each play differently, and they each come with a variety of equipment to customize further:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Zero-Tank Hunter: Nips wizards in the ankles, killing them instantly, while zipping around the map almost too fast for the enemies to see.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Tank: Wields a variety of heavy weapons like machineguns and firehoses to blast away small groups of wizards or even, with some care, the occasional demon.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Traitor Wizard: Turn coat and turn the tides of demons against the enemy, walking past enemies without alerting much suspicion, only to claim summoning circles for yourself and begin the slaughter.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The three difficulty settings have been carefully tuned for different kinds of players: Easy is hard if you're a newbie, Challenging is hard if you're experienced, and Ultra is easy if you're a masochist.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Make Other People Play Your Way</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Make your own levels with the same tools used to make all the levels in the game, and upload them to the Steam Workshop.</p>",
