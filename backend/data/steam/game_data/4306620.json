    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🃏 THE ART OF SYNERGY: DECKBUILDING</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A bloated deck is a death sentence. Mastery lies in purging the weak and orchestrating the <strong>Execution Stack</strong>. Your actions aren't instant; they queue up. Plan the perfect chain reaction to annihilate foes before they react. Every card must have a purpose—anything else is just noise between you and victory!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >⚔️ RUTHLESS TACTICAL COMBAT</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Combat is a brutal puzzle where knowledge is your shield. Analyze enemy intentions and exploit their weaknesses without mercy. Stun a charging Yeti with <i>Ice</i> or bypass armor with <i>Poison</i>. Victory belongs to those who adapt to the chaos, turning the elements against the beasts of the depths.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >👹 BOSSES AND THE ABYSS</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A descent into madness across evolving, hostile biomes. From the Whispering Forest to the Hell Peak, the world evolves to kill you. Every 10 levels, a Guardian demands perfection from your strategy. Survive them all to face <strong>The Abyss</strong> at level 100—an entity that devours reality. Only the ultimate deck can survive this final nightmare.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >⚖️ MERCHANTS: RISK &amp; REWARD</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Economy built on sacrifice. Visit the <strong>Kobold</strong> for safe Relics or the <strong>Goblin</strong> for chaotic gambles. But for the desperate, the <strong>Human Merchant</strong> awaits: he demands your <strong>Max HP</strong>. Are you willing to permanently sacrifice your vitality for forbidden power? Here, greed can save you—or kill you faster than any monster.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🎲 CONTROL YOUR LUCK</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >RNG exists, but skill dictates the winner. Tame the odds with the unique <strong>Freezer</strong> mechanic: save a crucial card for a future turn to set up devastating combos or secure a vital defense. Combine this with strategic Rerolls, and you'll realize that in CrawRefill, luck is just another resource to be managed.</p>",
