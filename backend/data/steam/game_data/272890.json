For those left below, they can get a temporary escape from the gloom through the Verti-Sphere, a device that allows them to rise virtually into the cloudy paradise to play mini golf on challenging obstacle courses floating in the sky. But something is amiss in this nation of two cities. Another voice is trying to break through the propaganda messages of peace and prosperity… the voice of an insurrection.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/272890/extras/1e8b9cee0c5326e876f80dc8efed1d4b.avif?t=1762297911\" width=616 height=112 /></span><br>Chip and putt your way through beautiful golf courses floating far above the smog-covered streets below.

A leisurely round of golf in the sky with up to three friends, of course! All the courses can be enjoyed in multiplayer either locally or online. There are also two more unusual multiplayer modes to enjoy: race each other to the finish on the race tracks or fight over control of the holes in the unique battle golf arenas whilst using a variety of offensive weapons to disrupt your opponents.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/272890/extras/fa3ce0402349205560452c85634aa8d8.avif?t=1762297911\" width=616 height=112 /></span><br>A fully featured map editor means you can design your own fiendish courses and share them with the community.
