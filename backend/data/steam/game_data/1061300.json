    "description": "<strong>Surprising My Neighbors</strong> is a first-person game where you are going to leave “surprises” at the doors of your beloved neighbors. One morning, you went outside and found… some poop at your door. It seems one of your neighbors left it there. However, you don’t know who exactly it was, so you will have to give that kind of “present” to every one of them. Be careful: it’s not something they might like when they find poop at their doors.",
