    "description": "The Museum of ThroughView is a VR museum unlike anything else. This is the first time a virtual reality app showcases <strong>2d to 3d conversions</strong> of famous paintings and old photographs.<br><br>When looking at these paintings in VR, the paintings themselves can also be experienced in 3d.<br><br>For each painting or photograph, background information can be accessed. Spread out through the museum are miniature models from which the 3d images were generated.<br><br>There are a total of 54 paintings and photographs on display from artists such as Rembrandt, Bierstadt, Monet. Included is also a special exhibition of photographs taken in New York before 1900 by Jacob Riis.<br><br>I hope you will enjoy having a walk through the museum.",
