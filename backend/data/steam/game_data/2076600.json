    "description": "MonsterTamer is an RPG in which you will tame beasts called &quot;Tamons&quot;. My goal is to add a more dynamic touch to the 2005-2010s Monster Taming genre, as I have always felt like this is what it needs the most. <br><br>You will fight wild creatures directly into the overworld. Defeat and tame them to become the most powerful tamer known in the land of Honnis. Grind to the top of the ladder and learn about the mysteries of this world. Build the perfect team and go on an adventure to discover Tamons that most consider to be myths and legends.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Features:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Top Down World:</strong> Explore the world of Honnis through a top down perspective. The grassfields, forests, caves and skies hide many secrets.</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Real Time Combat:</strong> There is no turn by turn here. Jump into the action, blast your enemies and avoid their attacks. Your battle will be fought in the overworld, which means that you could accidentally trigger more wild Tamons than you bargained for.</li></ul><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2076600/extras/3a0c785654cdd273d8da4698fad1f161.poster.avif?t=1667720946\" width=600 height=292 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2076600/extras/3a0c785654cdd273d8da4698fad1f161.webm?t=1667720946\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2076600/extras/3a0c785654cdd273d8da4698fad1f161.mp4?t=1667720946\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Speciel Abilities:</strong> Beyond learning combat skills, some Tamons will be able to learn specific skills that you will be able to use in order to ease your way through the wild.</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Single-Player Story:</strong> Progress through the story as you explore Honnis.
