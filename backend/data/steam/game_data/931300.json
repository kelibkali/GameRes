'Blenders' to gradually transition from one terrain type to another - these special maps can help provide limits to a maps edge or open the way to more adventurous climates. It also contains Rocky Mesas, Shaded Gulches, Temples, Mud Adobe, Ruins, Giant Skeletal Carcass, Desert Shipwreck, Oasis, Salt Flat, Salt Mine, Badlands, Poison Watering Hole, Mine Entrance, Encampment, Cave Entrance, Castle Tower, Canyon Swingbridge, Assorted Roads, Canyon Passes and Overlooks and a Dragons Gold Hoard. A selection that aims to cover the majority of desert-inspired storylines.</i><br>Maps are sized specially for FG at 1350x900 and under 500 kb each to help prevent slow-down during play. The maps are sized to perfectly fit a 50 or 60px grid that you can manually place over the top of the map using Fantasy Grounds. Join the maps in this module together with each other, with other modules in this series, use a single map or use a combination of Time-lapse, Role-play and/or the supplied weighted Random Roll Table to determine when maps are used and where adventurers end up next.<br>Join the maps in this module together with each other, with other modules in this series, use a single map or use a combination of Time-lapse, Role-play and/or the supplied weighted Random Roll Table to determine when maps are used and where adventurers end up next.<br>DM Convenience is the focus with several ways to access, use and choose the maps in this module.
