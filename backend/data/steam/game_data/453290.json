Also the game gave me lots of &quot;Aha!&quot; moments (a.k.a. the eureka effect). In any case, it was very pleasant experience.<br><br>It's not the end when you maximize your &quot;Awareness&quot; level, instead it's the beginning of the puzzle. When you get stuck, go back-to-the-basics; &quot;Check&quot; and &quot;Interact&quot; all the objects again!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A small hint:</h2>When you &quot;Check&quot; or &quot;Interact&quot; the object, a &quot;?&quot; or &quot;!&quot; icon over the girl's head will appear, if it has no colour, you'll know you are already &quot;aware&quot; of those objects.<br>When the level reaches 50% or 100%, the colour will come back and you will have detailed information for the objects.<br><br>When you use/lose the item, usually you can collect it again at the place where you found it. So stop whining and run for the item! (Sorry, the girl cannot run)<br><br>When you already have too many items and no space for a new one, you should go back and put another item back.<br>You can place the item by using it at the same place where you found it (same action as when you pick it up).<br><br><u>Controls (keyboard recommended):</u><br>Move: Arrow keys<br>Check/Interact: Z key<br>Switch action: Hold the left Shift key and select with Arrow keys<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/453290/extras/f6880b8bdcabacb878eca5b5e3ca35a1.avif?t=1572923933\" width=480 height=94 /></span><br><br>When confronted with something you don't really understand, you feel things like fear, or curiosity, but sometimes you also feel enjoyment when you start to make sense of it.<br><br>I wanted to recreate that feeling in a game, so I made &quot;Awareness Rooms&quot;.<br>I hope you will also feel the pleasure of the vague gradually taking shape as you solve each puzzle.",
