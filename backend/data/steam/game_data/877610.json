    "description": "Have you every dreamed of maneuvering an intricate mechanical beast across daunting obstacles? Or fighting other mechs in hand-to-hand combat? If so, this may be the game for you! Cyber Lemur will teach you to re-wire your brain to the challenging mech controls, and become one with the mech. You will then use your new-found aptitude to compete in races or time trials, make record-breaking jumps, or vanquish your foes with the sheer power of physics. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCyber Lemur is set in a dystopian future where humans are extinct and lemurs have emerged as the dominant species. After millennia of evolution, lemurs have become increasingly intelligent and developed advanced cybernetic technologies. This has allowed them to expand beyond the desolate landscape of earth, and to begin colonizing the moon. But if you are to survive this harsh life on the frontier, you must first prove yourself to be a skilled mech pilot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCyber Lemur is designed to help the user to gradually improve their character control through a variety of level designs. Xbox style controllers are supported. In addition to being a challenging single-player experience, Cyber Lemur can also be a great party game.
