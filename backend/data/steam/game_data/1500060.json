Welp it's simple...<br />\r\nJust some water with a bunch of bouyant bodies, you'd say &quot;so what?&quot;<br />\r\nYou can set up water parameters like waves altitude, speed, water level, densiry and some more.<br />\r\nWhat do you do with that?<br />\r\nJust drop some ships there and watch them &quot;having fun&quot;, and yeah you can build something yourself.<br />\r\nStill mot enough, welp, you dont really like those ships if you are asking - yes, there are some explosives too, alright, now go nuke it all.<br />\r\nAnd yeah dont forget to switch your map to one with some rocks...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn current state there are 5 explosives and 5 maps, but we will make shure to add more if you'd really like to, but I think it's enough to kill 30 mins",
