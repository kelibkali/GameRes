    "description": "Dream Engines: Nomad Cities original soundtrack composed by Alon Kaplan. Our soundtrack is influenced by the great works of Danny Elfman, especially as seen in films directed by Tim Burton. They combine spooky and whimsical elements with a lot of choir and some epic parts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNew tracks will be added to the sound track as we progress with the Early Access phase of Dream Engines and add new scores to the  game.",
