Levels are built in-house via a procedurally assisted level generation process and are <strong>delivered periodically via steam update</strong>, which means you won't be playing on the same stale level. Our level designers edit each level before it goes out and are constantly trying new concepts. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/753650/extras/34b4054170e7a8b6db5ce2a77dfe6040.avif?t=1769533122\" width=616 height=120 /></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/753650/extras/8fc99062c13eed41f3af921df700cd8b.poster.avif?t=1769533122\" width=616 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/753650/extras/8fc99062c13eed41f3af921df700cd8b.webm?t=1769533122\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/753650/extras/8fc99062c13eed41f3af921df700cd8b.mp4?t=1769533122\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><strong>Teamwork starts with a goal. </strong>Discuss your strategy over voice chat, and use the <strong>planning phase</strong> to draw up a plan of attack.

Their weapons and gear are relics and rudimentary, but are not to be underestimated. <strong>Cunning is their strength</strong>. Anticipate what the enemy is planning, then set up the kill zone. Lay traps, coordinate crossfire with your team, and exploit breaks in the attack to flank the enemy and bring a decisive end to the fight. </p>",
