    "description": "Through the Masks of Luzia, based on the acclaimed Cirque du Soleil production, is a vibrant celebration of Mexican culture, shrouded in surrealism and dreamlike fantasy. A mysterious child serves as your guide as you journey through uncanny worlds of mythical proportions: a demigod swings across the gateway to the Mayan afterlife and gains the trust of an ancient jaguar; a contortionist, flanked by animals and insects, grants you a front row seat to the awe-inspiring wildlife; a monarch butterfly dances, evoking the celerity of the Tarahumara people. With all this and more, prepare for the waking dream of Through the Masks of Luzia.",
