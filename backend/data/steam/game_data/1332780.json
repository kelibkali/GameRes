Solve puzzles, unlock mysteries, and determine your fate. Played in the Third Person in a Zero-G environment. With a cinematic score. High quality voice acting. A story over 10 years in the making. From solo developer, David Fazzio.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This game builds upon the success of David's debut game, The Companion. This game has a strong focus on Story and Narrative and is accompanied with striking visuals and artistic style. This follow-up game will layer in more gameplay components such as puzzles, mystery and survival. Play in a brutal, yet beautiful, sci-fi environment.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1332780/extras/e757e0dfa80138d1751d7fc38faa9571.avif?t=1729193629\" width=615 height=70 /></span></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > A game of survival, and the will to survive.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > A branching storyline that can change based on previous decisions.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > Solve puzzles and unravel mysteries.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > A Punishing environment with numerous death scenarios.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > Featuring a beautiful soundtrack and high quality voice acting</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > Zero-G movement.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1332780/extras/154a414f0a0907cc39623621320a759d.avif?t=1729193629\" width=614 height=70 /></span>In search for the next hospitable planet, a group of humans embark on a 200 year voyage to another galaxy. Their bodies rest in stasis as the AI controlled vessel makes its long journey. During the voyage the vessel is struck by debris. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >There is catastrophic damage to the vessel. The areas hit are sealed off and the vessel continues onward. However, the full effects of the devastation have not yet been fully realized. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Years later your cryo-chamber succumbs and you are jolted awake from your stasis. You are injured, cold, and alone. You have been awakened… A lifetime too soon.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Can you survive?

This story was conjured up over 10 years ago as a potential short film project. Transitioning this story into a game only made sense and will allow for much more freedom. I am excited to explore Zero-G movement, the sci-fi genre, and space environments. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >With the recent advances in technology, now independent and solo developers have so much more resources and power at their disposal. I feel confident I can output a very high quality product to accompany this story. In the past year we've been introduced to Unreal Engine 5 and Metahumans, both technologies I intend to take full advantage of. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >My first game, The Companion, took 10 months of development. I intend for this project to take a bit longer to develop. This project has many more demands that will elongate development. I will strive to release development updates throughout the duration of this project.
