Vampires can not go out during the day and will burst into flames if they do so. However, they can move under shadows, such as inside old buildings or under thick trees that provide protection from the direct sun. Vampires come in several different classes. <br><br><strong>Ghouls</strong> - A basic goblin-like vampire that can use primitive weapons. Ghouls tend to travel in packs and try to swarm humans. These form the majority of enemies that you encounter, they are similar to the <i>RE4 Ganado.</i><br><br><strong>Vampires </strong>- A fully transformed vampire of the night. Very strong, they tend to live in caves or other dark places. Can be killed by an arrow to the heart or massive body damage. <br><br><strong>Alpha Vampires</strong> - Strong vampires that can cause massive damage quickly. They can only be killed with a strike to the multiple hearts they have on their body.<i> Alpha-Vampires</i> serve as mini-boss fights.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Story So Far...</h2>Nobody really knows how the world changed so fast, but what we do know is that when the vampires came, mankind was driven behind the Night Gate. The Night Gate, and the walls that connect to it, surround the last human settlements. Little is known if the Night Gate was designed to keep the vampires out or to keep mankind in, like some kind of cattle ranch, but these are secrets that you will uncover in your quest to kill the master vampire, Lord Grendel!<br><br>You play as Robin, a vampire hunter and a member of the Survivors Guild, who has been tasked with finding a way to penetrate the Night Gate, and destroy Lord Grendel before his horde of 10,000 ghouls breaches the walls.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay</h2><br>Set in a giant swamp along the Mississippi River, the player has the freedom to go where they want on their Airboat. Players will need to keep an eye on the time of day, as vampires come out at night. Players will also have to hunt for food, as they can starve to death. The game is divided into two parts, the first part takes place inside the walls of the Night Gate, where players must find a way to stop Grendels army of 10,000 ghouls. This plays a lot like <i>Majora's Mask</i> where there is a time limit pressuring the player. The army of Grendel will arrive at the walls in roughly one game week (one-hour irl). Players can do different tasks to extend this timer, but if the timer runs out, the players are treated to the &quot;dark ending&quot; of the game where they are put in a giant <i>Lord of the Rings</i>-style battle against Grendels army on the walls of the Night Gate!<br><br>If the player is successful in the first part of the game, the army timer is removed. The second half of the game takes place in Grendel Temple, which is a giant Metroidvania-style dungeon, where the player must use all the items and skills they have acquired to explore new areas and defeat giant bosses.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><br>Night Gate features classic RPG tropes. Filled with side missions and NPCs the player can talk to and interact with. <strong>Game mechanics such as &quot;hunger&quot; can be turned off. </strong><br><br>Full working Day/Night system.<br><br>Powered by the latest graphics of Unreal Engine 5, players can explore the massive open world of the bayou.<br><br>The game features leadership boards based on in-game challenges such as ranking players' biggest caught Fish and achievements for players that are looking for a challenge.",
