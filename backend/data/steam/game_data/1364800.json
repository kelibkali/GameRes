The division between the haves and the have-nots has never been as stark. A peasant uprising is threatening to turn into a bloody class-based civil war. How far will you go to do your sworn duty? Will you restore order by any means necessary? Or will you instead throw kindling into the fire, and watch it burn all around you? In The Emperor’s Own, the choice is always yours.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364800/extras/b0baa22a3a1ca75a7bc30a8b2a398ea1.avif?t=1667202538\" width=618 height=242 /></span><br><br>The world awaiting you is one of contrasts and extremes, from the dizzying wealth of the imperial palace and the capital, to the poverty and destitution of backwater villages. You’ll be fully immersed in a time and place unlike quite any before seen in a computer game. We don’t sugarcoat anything, and don’t pull any punches. You’ll experience that world and its atmosphere with all the glory and all the horror it has to offer, without any fairy-tales, magic, or monsters. Only real people attempting to find their way through trying times, showcasing the best and the worst that human beings are capable of.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364800/extras/3503c1d59f22b3df3672d19ff89c9e96.avif?t=1667202538\" width=614 height=262 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364800/extras/845e158daf5f605acb64a5fd61e9d7b4.avif?t=1667202538\" width=618 height=310 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364800/extras/cc3baadb5beddc799661079ee5c48199.avif?t=1667202538\" width=618 height=77 /></span><br>You'll take on the role of Cornet Alexander Obolenskii, a young officer recently recruited into Secret Intelligence because of outstanding accomplishments in the Imperial Academy, and an even more outstanding last name. The unit answers to no one but the Emperor himself. You’re entrusted with life and death authority over all other residents of the Empire, from the lowest peasant to the highest aristocrat. Will you use that power to carry out your orders? To advance your personal interests? To fight for an idealistic cause? That is, of course, up to you.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364800/extras/1f90906b17605012ce8cd2e643b82c30.avif?t=1667202538\" width=618 height=264 /></span><br><br>Along your adventure you’ll meet a memorable cast of characters. Each has his own thoughts, motivations, and hidden agendas. The world is not black and white, and there are no heroes or villains. You’ll encounter daring officers, noble ladies, corrupt officials, firebrand rebels, sadistic psychopaths, and God knows whoever else. The game is fully voiced, and all the characters are brought to life by top-tier professional voice actors.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364800/extras/954b7c55861ad590e39b772a94c77c92.poster.avif?t=1667202538\" width=700 height=220 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364800/extras/954b7c55861ad590e39b772a94c77c92.webm?t=1667202538\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364800/extras/954b7c55861ad590e39b772a94c77c92.mp4?t=1667202538\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>In addition to grand political intrigue, there are personal moments to experience, including friendship, family, and romance.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364800/extras/fa64f8c14c493aa9af0abb9f13261694.avif?t=1667202538\" width=300 height=514 /></span><br><br>And should you wish to indulge your baser desires, there will be an opportunity to do that as well.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364800/extras/02ec1a0ee0e980fd9be6d7f436fab30c.avif?t=1667202538\" width=614 height=280 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364800/extras/c3981425895cac52bd89c236e0217e25.avif?t=1667202538\" width=618 height=77 /></span><br>The story is not linear, and your decisions truly matter. They have far-reaching consequences that don’t reveal themselves until later on. Once you make a choice, you’ll have to live with it, no matter the outcome.

The Slavomir Empire is recovering after a vicious conflict with its southern neighbor. Word is spreading that the uneasy peace is about to give way to another war, even more bloody and devastating than the last.

Few people are aware of the true situation in the Empire, however. Most of high society are still attending balls and receptions in the capital without a care in the world, although there’s discontent among some of the nobility as well. Secret societies and plots of all manner abound. The line between enemy and friend, truth and lies is getting ever more blurred. The Empire is atop a powder keg; all that’s missing is a spark. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364800/extras/dc1c9cc5150897fdce388783fa565bf0.avif?t=1667202538\" width=618 height=318 /></span><br><br>And in the midst of it all, rumors of mysterious and supernatural events in the borderlands have reached the capital.
