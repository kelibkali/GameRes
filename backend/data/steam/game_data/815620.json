    "description": "Cyber Escape is an infinite runner in which you must survive as long as you can in an attempt to escape the police of a future dystopian world after your smuggling run went wrong. Smash cars out of your way to gain a higher streak and get more points, and risk it all by moving closer to the front for a higher multiplier- but a better chance at getting hit by the oncoming traffic.",
