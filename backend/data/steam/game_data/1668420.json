The objective of the game is to find out the killer at the end of 6 cases, they can be any of the characters, chosen randomly at the beginning of each game. In order to give the feeling of being a detective, the game cannot be limited to a script or linear cases, for this, the assassin is controlled by an artificial intelligence that improves its methods based on your playstyle. Thus, it is composed of randomizations, whether on the killer, method of murder, locations, characters in each case, murder weapons, dialogues, etc.. So every time a new game is created, you will have a new experience as a detective, knowing that it will be their actions as a detective that will guide the course of the story.",
