    "description": "The original score of The Last Survey is composed, recorded, and performed by Lewis Kopenhafer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis moody, atmospheric, and stirring score utilizes experimental recording techniques and unconventional use of mallet instruments. Kopenhafer's soundtrack is a beautiful and dense compliment to the nuanced narrative of The Last Survey, and the two disc complete soundtrack includes all the subtle variations that players might not have picked up on during their play throughs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis soundtrack has inspired Kopenhafer to continue to hone this technique and develop an ongoing series of works initially based on some of the compositional ideas found herein.",
