Hall (edit) (bonus track) (4:39) </li></ul><br><br>Stockholm based <strong>Unknown Factor,</strong> also known as Mikael Nybom, creates electronic music extracted straight from the soul. A futuristic, yet timeless sound we think goes hand in hand with that of <strong>The Cleansing</strong> universe.<br><br>As it might seem, Mikael Nybom is not new to music.<br><br>It was after visits to London and Metalheadz Sunday Sessions at Blue Note in the 90’s that his love for jungle and drum &amp; bass started to emerge, and soon after the <strong>Unknown Factor</strong> alias was created.<br><br>Years after he moved to London to pursue his musical mission. A few minor Unknown Factor releases followed. But he felt that the scene was at the time starting to stagnate in quality and losing touch with its “soul”. The focus shifted over to other genres and he made further connections within the London Hip-Hop, Broken Beat and House scenes. Helping out with productions for other hip-hop and vocal artists.<br><br>But it wasn’t until he formed the house music project <strong>Wipe The Needle</strong> together with West Londoner Lee Gomez, that they together could step into the limelight. Releases followed on labels such as Defected, 4th Floor, Deeply Rooted House and Raw Fusion.<br><br>In 2009 he moved back to Stockholm, and gradually parted away from Wipe The Needle.<br><br>He later pursued on a career as a game developer / 2D artist, and at Grindstone Interactive, it lead to this chance to re-connect with his old alias.",
