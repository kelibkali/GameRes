It means that PGM 2 is still in its early stages of development. We have completely rebuilt the game from its predecessor, so this is a completely new game. It’s built on the original PGM idea and it’s designed to be developed through an early access process.  <br><br><br><strong>So what can you expect from PGM 2 in its current form?</strong> <br>While there are final and core game play features implemented, there are many that aren’t or will need to be tweaked.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Bugs and crashes are to be expected.<br></li><li>There might be performance issues for some players.<br></li><li>And more.</li></ul><br>This is all part of the development process and we’d love for you to join us early on, on this road to finish the game. So if you think our gameplay is enough for you to want to back PGM 2 in its pre alpha stage, we’d love your support. Otherwise we recommend you to wait until we’ve come further along in the development process when the game is more stable and we’ve implemented additional gameplay and other content. We’re committed to making PGM 2 the best game it can possibly be and having you join us on this journey is a vital part in making this happen.",
