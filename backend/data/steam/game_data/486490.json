    "description": "What if you were accused of being a witch?<br />\r\nWould you accept it, or would you fight?<br />\r\nWhat would you stoop to in order to protect yourself?<br />\r\nWitan is an oldskool rpg that goes for the simplistic gameplay mechanics, but not the &quot;retro look&quot; (unless you want). It's fully 3D.<br />\r\nYou are a young woman (perhaps correctly) accused of being a witch, by one of the local barons, and that is a death sentence.<br />\r\nIn order to survive, you need to improve your standing, tool up, and indeed become a potent witch.<br />\r\nThe gameplay is quite simple, but your hand is not held. Do not expect your objectives to glow in front of you, or indeed dangers to be obvious.<br />\r\nPersevere, there is a way, a method, and a story, but it's not going to leap out and scream at you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\nIt's Pretty (in a grim way).<br />\r\nNice landscape with day/night cycles (again, in a grim way).<br />\r\nIt's only slightly silly: no copper bras, etc.<br />\r\nMixture between oldskool (choice driven/find stuff) game play and 3D walk/run around.<br />\r\nYou can jump (for no apparent reason).<br />\r\nSave your game (although you'll have to find out how)<br />\r\nShops (which you'll also have to find)<br />\r\nEnemies (which you'll have no problems finding)<br />\r\nApprox 2 Hrs game play (If you're a god, and a lucky one at that), much more if you're a mere mortal.<br />\r\nSome really odd stuff that probably shouldn't be there (you'll find it). <br />\r\nA RetroVision setting for the pixel purists, and Gamma adjust (for those who just can't see anything :)).",
