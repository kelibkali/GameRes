    "description": "Forced out of her solitude, the ancient entity, Soul returns to defend the world she once strove to rebuild. From the ashes of an ancient war, came the fusion of cybernetic and organic life, a synthesis of forms that now connects all life on the planet. But a new threat has emerged: The Prophet of Ruin, intent on overriding the network that spans all minds, enslaving them to his vile purposes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou play as Soul, and must take over the bodies of enemies to progress, inheriting their strengths and weaknesses. Swap between foes to maintain your health and gain valuable abilities that will aid in you in your struggle against the evil Prophet.",
