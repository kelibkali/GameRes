    "description": "Based on 1930's cartoon style made with hand-drawn animations, the game tells the story of 6 animals over the course of 12 levels while they interact with the effects of humans over the environment. You can't fight back, all you can do is try to survive.<br><br>Play as 3 different animals (male or female) with their unique gameplay where you try to avoid being hit, without being able to fight back.<br><br>Run and jump avoiding obstacles as a deer or a sheep, fly up and down as 2 birds avoiding polluted clouds and swim around as 2 fish avoiding being fished or stuck in bags. All of that to try to escape the Forest Determination and find a new safe place to live.<br><br>Each one of the 12 levels has 3 patterns of attacks.<br><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>**Warning***<br>If the game's resolution seems off, try to disable Window's font scaling or set it to default (100%)</li></ul>",
