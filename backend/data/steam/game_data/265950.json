At its core is a story exploration path free from puzzles where you can unfold the story at your own pace.<br><br>There is also a deeper, more adventurous path in which you can complete complex puzzles to restore life changing events of the patients history in order to help the validation of their life.<br><br>Parallel paths make Ether One accessible to a range of skilled players. Invite your friends and family around to pick their brains for help taking on challenging environmental puzzles, or soak in the atmosphere of Pinwheel at leisure. From a young age we enjoyed the first person puzzle games that required you to write cryptic notes on spare pieces of paper to unravel mysteries. Ether One aims to bring back pen and paper puzzle solving, whilst still being accessible and optional for people not wanting to get stuck and frustrated on the harder puzzles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> First Person Adventure Game.<br></li><li> Open narrative exploration in the town of Pinwheel. <br></li><li> Optional puzzle solving.<br></li><li> Accessible gameplay with additional controller support for players that aren’t as skilled with complex controls.<br></li><li> Challenging pen and paper puzzle design you can decrypt at your own pace.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Deluxe Edition</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/265950/extras/b0768967d3912d23e2890638c6551034.avif?t=1725434716\" width=616 height=352 /></span><br><br>The Ether One Deluxe Edition comes with the Ether One OST, Game Script, &amp; Comics along with a few more goodies.
