This anonymous commander doesn't have much time to live; <strong><u>in 96 hours</u></strong>, a contagious nano-borne pathogen will spread through the commanders brain, becoming part of the Viral Legion. Assuming the role of the only military operator capable of fighting against the Viral Legion directly, you must thrust yourself in a 96 hour vigil and complete the suicide mission before you become a nexus of the enemy. As the sole survivor of Space Fortress Vigrior, with the only living ansible connection in enemy territory, you are charged with designing, training and executing battle maneuvers for an arsenal of space-borne combat drones.</h2></div></div><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/367340/extras/baaa8f1a530a36166756de2b8ef67ef1.webp?t=1464068573\" width=640 height=29 /></span><br><div class=\"bb_code\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong><u>GAMEPLAY</u></strong></h2><div class=\"bb_code\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >This game presents an innovation in 2D action games; we introduce the ability to radically manipulate tactical maneuvers in real time.
