    "description": "Dragon Defense is a tower defense inspired puzzle game in which the objective is to delay a ferocious dragon from reaching your castle and devouring your villagers!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThough the dragon cannot be killed, it can be slowed down, distracted, and otherwise delayed while the villagers of your fair kingdom make a hasty retreat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn order to save your villagers, you have access to a myriad of traps, magical lures and natural obstacles to hold off the dragon for as long as possible. Every second gained saves additional villagers!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe dragon's priorities are simple: Take the shortest route possible to the castle and crack it open like a nut and enjoy its contents. Your goal is equally simple: Delay the dragon for as long as possible!",
