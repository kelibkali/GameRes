For some reason, he looked like a giant blue frog- so he did what any hero would do and freeloaded at the old lady's house and the local inn for a month.<br><br>After realizing he should <i>probably</i> do something about the fact that he was now a frog, he began to train in the art of morphing so he could answer the call of duty from a strange voice in his head...<br><br>Cutscenes are animated (and skippable, for you speedrunners out there) and have many, many plottwists.  Characters backstab each other, lie, and onscreen (non-graphic) death occurs.  The story is a pun-filled one-liner fest, but be prepared for some scary moments and tears.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025180/extras/215da2d32c260ccfe2a7a3b10609f099.webp?t=1563966970\" width=600 height=48 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025180/extras/8bb6c4eb7a95c09225c6bf365e58daae.poster.avif?t=1563966970\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025180/extras/8bb6c4eb7a95c09225c6bf365e58daae.webm?t=1563966970\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025180/extras/8bb6c4eb7a95c09225c6bf365e58daae.mp4?t=1563966970\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Monsters have a small chance to have a different color palette.
