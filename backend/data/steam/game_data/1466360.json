    "description": "A single-player adventure full of wonderful landscapes and beautiful musics for PC, it tells a deeply emotional story of a lovely friendship. Solve puzzles, sneak around creatures and use your spherical shield as your only protection. Attack using the same shield with speed, or by countering. <br><br><br>This shield protects you from incoming attacks. Anything inside will be safe, but most of the enemies deal enough damage with one strike to destroy it. Hopefully, it'll buy you enough time to escape and reach safety. <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466360/extras/51909595ca82efe4ca99b2a8a1c299f6.poster.avif?t=1770881593\" width=360 height=202 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466360/extras/51909595ca82efe4ca99b2a8a1c299f6.webm?t=1770881593\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466360/extras/51909595ca82efe4ca99b2a8a1c299f6.mp4?t=1770881593\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><br>The dash can be used to dodge attacks, tho the creatures will be quite quick to strike so you better watch out ! <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466360/extras/11158520f55f082033357ef36291b3f3.poster.avif?t=1770881593\" width=360 height=202 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466360/extras/11158520f55f082033357ef36291b3f3.webm?t=1770881593\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466360/extras/11158520f55f082033357ef36291b3f3.mp4?t=1770881593\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><br>As you gain speed while holding the shield activated, the protection becomes an attack.

If you use the shield at the same time you get attacked, the Counter will be hit before the shield and you'll have successfully countered the attack. The energy of the incoming strike will be converted and transferred into a blast that'll deal damage to the nearby enemies. However you will loose enough energy in the process that you won't be able to use your shield until recovering using a crystal.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466360/extras/5a7e81d604f00528df7de731b85b7c36.poster.avif?t=1770881593\" width=360 height=202 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466360/extras/5a7e81d604f00528df7de731b85b7c36.webm?t=1770881593\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466360/extras/5a7e81d604f00528df7de731b85b7c36.mp4?t=1770881593\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
