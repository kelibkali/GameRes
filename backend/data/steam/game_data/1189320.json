Through hidden doorways and between flesh-strewn trees you seek the name of the one who dares haunt this world and, in fantastic ritual, rip them from out of the Veil to face you in grim combat. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >To Ash and Ember is a singleplayer Dark Fantasy Event-based RPG largely inspired by the Arkham Horror 2nd Edition board game with modern twists and nods to modern modes and ways of thinking about dice and cards. This is a game of time management and decisions, of who to save and what to sacrifice, and of a City whose windows and streets grow darker and stranger the longer your battles continue.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1189320/extras/e210e8153d776bc6e14ffd12f9f5a082.avif?t=1736277793\" width=600 height=120 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Features</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>The Slaughtered Gods leave indelible marks.</strong> Investigators may become as warped as that which they fight: going mad, growing horns, and perhaps even dying and becoming a Wraith.
