The longer you play the harder it'll be as the tower becomes more and more unstable, however, you'll also get more points that you can use to unlock levels and cosmetic items. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Play solo for relaxation <br></li><li>Play with up to six players online(friends or randoms) for drama<br></li><li>The loser will be marked by one of the players(or they can show mercy, but then what's the point!)<br></li><li>6 unique environments(one of them was specifically designed for low-end potatoes, IMHO everyone deserves to be yelled at regardless of hardware)<br></li><li>Full control over the hand movement(forearm, wrist, and fingers)</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1166760/extras/c48dbaf81a77ba63a4eb117150961fb0.poster.avif?t=1581900075\" width=576 height=348 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1166760/extras/c48dbaf81a77ba63a4eb117150961fb0.webm?t=1581900075\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1166760/extras/c48dbaf81a77ba63a4eb117150961fb0.mp4?t=1581900075\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
