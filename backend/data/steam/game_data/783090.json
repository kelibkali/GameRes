    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>A nostalgia-fuelled first person shoot 'em up inspired by classic arcade games.</strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Save the Earth, burn the Sun.</strong></h2><br>To pay off your life debts you’ve been uploaded to one of millions of nano-workbots in the Sun’s core to prevent solar flares by breaking down neon isotopes.<br><br>You control an ion cannon in a 360º gravitationally affected environment, firing positive and negative ions using left &amp; right triggers at incoming neon isotopes of varying ‘charge’ to eliminate them.<br>  <br>Neon uses a modern day reboot of the classic retro arcade style. Featuring vector polygonal lines and surfaces illuminated by pulsating neon lighting with immersive 360º action.<br><br>Each of the 42 levels of the game have been carefully crafted with each formation requiring a different strategy to achieve best times. There’s a solid sense of progression and a steady ramping up of difficulty - ideal for introducing non-gamers to VR but challenging enough for more experienced players. <br><br>Levels develop to include stronger gravitational forces, more isotopes, and new kinds of jeopardy. Boss levels with super-structures need new strategies, with a selection of power-ups such as slo-mo, shockwave and solar blossom mode adding to the fun. Your sassy AI sidekick Seren has always got something to say - but is mostly just sarcastic.<br><br>Utilising the talents of three music producers (Forward Memory, Dynamix, and I Am Galactic), Neon features an original soundtrack of ambient electronica, synthwave and electro which complements the modern-retro styling of the game.<br><br><strong>“It’s like Tron had sex with an atom” </strong>- <i>some guy on Reddit</i>",
