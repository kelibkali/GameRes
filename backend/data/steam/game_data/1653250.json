    "description": "Aliens are very fond of flex. This guy is no exception, he wants to dance for you. But for that he needs space drugs for aliens. You need to kill all the guards and steal drugs.<br />\r\n&quot;Alien Flex&quot; is a top-down Sci-Fi shooter filled with synthwave electronic music and vibrant effects. Kill enemies, pick up their weapons, which differ in shooting mechanics and ultimate attacks, complete levels and reach bosses. You can dodge projectiles with a forward flip, or use a dash and slash at enemies with your cyberblade. At the end of each level the alien will dance for you. Music and dances at each level are different. You ask, how can such a formidable alien dance? I will answer, very beautiful.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe music in this game is completely free to stream on YouTube or Twitch.",
