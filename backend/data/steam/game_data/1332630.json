    "description": "The Cloudy Night! This is how the night it all began became known. Much of the population has turned into terrifying zombies that in their insatiable hunger have devoured another large part of it. The survivors take refuge in the bars where they were and after deep analysis they concluded that what’s saved them was the fact they are all consumers of a particular type of craft beer. That's what saved their humanity ! So, they they organized themselves to seek out other survivors and offer salvation through this miraculous drink. For that they will count with Steven, a brave and smart pizza delivery guy who will risk his neck to deliver the craft beers manufactured by brewer Norman and save the humanity from this terrible pest.",
