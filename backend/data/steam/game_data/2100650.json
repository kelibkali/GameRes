Weighing under 450kg, including the driver, it can execute a full 180° turn nearly instantaneously, subjecting the driver to 4g's in the tightest corners. Approximately 6½ meters in length, they are powered by a single V6 two-stroke outboard engine and equipped with a three or four-blade supercavitating propeller. With over 400hp and capable of revving beyond 9,000rpm, these boats can accelerate from 0 to 100km/h in under two seconds and achieve top speeds of 250km/h. Hydraulic trim allows the driver to tilt the motor in and out of the water for optimal maneuverability.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2100650/extras/9f55f486b4eedc42be6b28cf0471dedc.avif?t=1744183084\" width=600 height=324 /></span>An Inboard Hydroplane is a stunning sight on the water, known for its blistering speed, sleek design, impressive rooster tails, and thunderous noise. Powered by a supercharged V8 engine with a staggering 1,400hp and cranking over 8,000rpm, they can reach speeds up to 260km/h. With a load of around 1,350kg, with the driver, and measuring 7 meters in length, these boats demonstrate extraordinary speed and agilty while throwing massive walls of water into the air. To manage lift and stability, hydroplanes use a canard and rely on a skid fin and rudder for turning.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2100650/extras/6a8acc8f8934bc9ab7814517ab4249e0.webp?t=1744183084\" width=568 height=51 /></span><br>Jetsprint, Unlimited Hydroplane, Mod-V, Super Stock, Tri-Hull, Crackerbox, Stock Hydro, Stock Runabout, K-Boat, Class One, PWC, Stunt Craft<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2100650/extras/0ef90eca769b3ef833387c92778eb458.webp?t=1744183084\" width=568 height=51 /></span><br>Locate and save stranded vessels, remove debris from active race courses, help crashed racers, or chase criminals while playing as the Coast Guard.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2100650/extras/ab9dbf3a7263a359d1904d1d01ddb111.webp?t=1744183084\" width=568 height=51 /></span><br>Experience fast-paced, unforgiving, circuit, sprint, and drag racing with real power boats.
