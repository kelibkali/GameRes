    "description": "The Normandy invasion has started and it's time to move your battalions of tanks off the beaches and into the battlefields of Europe. You are in command of each tank, all the way down to the angle and power of each shot. Choose your shell type, aim by skill (not random values), move anywhere (no grids) and take on the armored machines of the Axis powers, or switch sides and defend fortress Europe from the Allied invasion. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/400350/extras/9672d56c293cd7865e0a701457ff270c.poster.avif?t=1763042576\" width=600 height=336 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/400350/extras/9672d56c293cd7865e0a701457ff270c.webm?t=1763042576\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/400350/extras/9672d56c293cd7865e0a701457ff270c.mp4?t=1763042576\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Battle Fleet: Ground Assault lands the Battle Fleet series onto the tank battlefields of World War 2. Continuing the strategy and unique “Worms” / “Scorched Earth” style angle+distance mechanic of Battle Fleet 2, Battle Fleet: Ground Assault adds destructible environments, armor, shell types and all new tactics. Hit their engines and cripple the enemy's maneuverability, or aim for the crew compartment and disable their tank for an entire turn.
