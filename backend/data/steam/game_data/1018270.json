    "description": "<i>Throughout history, civilizations have risen and fallen, each with its particular culture, habits and myths. With the evolution of human knowledge and the advent of modern technology, humanity has become more and more skeptic and have strayed away from their deities. But centuries of glory and power cannot be forgotten….</i><br><br>Get ready for conquering the world as a God! But don’t think it’s going to be that easy. Humans have evolved in many aspects since the mythological times, so be wise while using your divine abilities: Show compassion to those who have nothing and they will love you. Take from those who have everything and they will fear you. Watch out for the events happening all around the globe and avoid skepticism. Make humanity praise you! <br><br>Choose your God, evolve His traits, build temples and cast your abilities. Convert territories, gain worshipers and make the Earth belong to the gods once again! Long live the Greek Gods!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1018270/extras/993d7e94d1b6503a35d5e5174765210b.avif?t=1573608174\" width=600 height=993 /></span><br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>True-to-life scenario: 71 distinct territories with stats modeled after their real-life counterparts, including other religious presences;<br></li><li>Twelve major and nine minor gods: From the very famous to the most uncommon Greek myths;</li></ul><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1018270/extras/c077e1200d2e64aa891d3428145b2f40.avif?t=1573608174\" width=620 height=248 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Real-time events: Take advantage of them and gain bonuses or fail and watch skepticism rise;<br></li><li>More than 250 divine abilities: all of them based on actual mythological tales about its God;<br></li><li>Use your blessings or curses to gain Faith: Spend it to buy more abilities, develop traits to gain bonuses and even recruit a minor god that might be able to affect attributes you can’t.</li></ul>",
