You must master both the art of trade and the art of war. Expand your fleet with new warships and cargo ships. The former will allow you to take on larger and more powerful enemies, while the latter will increase your trading capabilities and make you even richer. Your fleet will become an unstoppable force, feared by all who cross your path.<br><br>In Barbarossa, you'll have to outwit and outfight other fleets to emerge victorious. And when you do, you'll have the opportunity to control other islands and all the goods that come with it.",
