The strategies are yours to make, and we will continue to expand upon the game with new and exciting updates to bring you hours of entertainment!<br><br><strong><i>BattleStick is, and will always be, a <strong>Free-to-Play</strong> game.</i></strong><br><br><strong>In-Game Purchases</strong> : To support development, there will be items made available for purchase within the game, but they will never be offered to gain an advantage over others. For example, you are able to purchase skins and weapons with the in-game currency &quot;Coins&quot; for use immediately, however you can also unlock each and every weapon/skin from leveling up. So it is up to you, the player, if you wish to grind it out, or support the developers and get to use a specific weapon/wear a specific skin without waiting.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/394380/extras/bdd6451f92c024c275670ae20d8042ce.avif?t=1649010411\" width=616 height=616 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Controls</strong></h2><br>WAD/ZQD or Up/Left/Right arrow keys: Movement.<br>S or Down arrow key: Regenerate HP.<br>Left Mouse Button: Use Weapon.<br>Right Mouse Button: Drop a Satchel Charge/Explode a dropped Satchel Charge.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Server Location</strong></h2>USA.",
