    "description": "<br><br>Welcome to Zedfest, the goriest game show ever created! Up to 6 Players work together to complete objectives while killing Zeds with lots and lots of visceral gore. The Zeds are mentally defective creatures created by worthless biologists, built with an A.I that´s even more shitty and designed by underqualified engineers. Some DNA used was taken from animals such as pigs and horses for that extra enjoyable meaty experience. They have the sole purpose of trying to stop the contestant from completing their objectives and die for entertainment. Making them the perfect material for the show.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1037080/extras/4cca1eef1e068e6f9b8a9bb23e9db980.avif?t=1680886813\" width=640 height=100 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> SINGLEPLAYER OR MULTIPLAYER - No friends?
