Hence, there is no in-game skill system, as all movement options are unlocked from the start.<br>This is balanced by the coordination you have with your friend (or lack thereof ;) leading to constantly surprising situations, or discovering new movement options!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1015190/extras/7546d27d2884e3b35bc54b98ebc054ba.poster.avif?t=1662068634\" width=500 height=280 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1015190/extras/7546d27d2884e3b35bc54b98ebc054ba.webm?t=1662068634\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1015190/extras/7546d27d2884e3b35bc54b98ebc054ba.mp4?t=1662068634\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>The goal is to make you re-feel that fresh experience of a child playing videogames for the first time...</strong><br>The controversial input layout and its resulting movement^, form the core of this experience. Even the spellword system highlights the rebirth of what you are used to.<br>Instead of &quot;Press Q to cast fireball&quot;, you literally type &quot;fire&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >True Non-Linear Level Design</h2>Look at platformer and castlevania level design. Linear hallways with generic enemy placements. <br>Metroidvanias also suffer greatly from this, as they promote &quot;non-linear exploration&quot; which is only for the connection of the levels, but not the levels themselves!<br>These boring levels <span class=\"bb_spoiler\">when you aren't in the lategame full of mobility upgrades</span> can only be traversed with the exact same inputs the developer pressed and designed, only the timing of these buttons is different...<br><br>Double Damnation's level design was tailored to its expressive movement, and so, every level is non-linear.<br>For this reason, there are few levels, but they can never grow old, as you grow more skilled and traverse them in a different way - faster or safer.<br><strong>Every run, a different path.</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1015190/extras/cc5c9f80249ef16d599a8e645e4584a2.avif?t=1662068634\" width=490 height=112 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Movement deeper than the Aegean Sea</h2></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Designed exclusively around Assymetrical Co-Op</h2></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >True Non-Linear Level Design</h2></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Insanity Mode</h2></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Fully Voice-Acted</h2></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story which doesn't interrupt gameplay</h2></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Multiple Endings</h2></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Endless Deaths <span class=\"bb_spoiler\">git gud</span></h2></li></ul>",
