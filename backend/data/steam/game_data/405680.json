    "description": "Do you enjoy Visual Novels? Have you ever wondered what it would be like if the other characters you encounter were actual players like yourself? Sentou Gakuen: Revival takes the Visual Novel experience to the unknown level where the traditional Visual Novel experience collides with interactive elements in a chaotic, player-driven, high school setting.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story</h2>You are a student at a random high school in Japan, where delinquency, chaos, and strange occurrences are everyday events. How will you navigate this wild environment? Will you make allies or enemies? The choice is yours as you carve out your own story in this atypical school setting.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay</h2>The game is presented in a Visual Novel style, but unlike traditional VNs, the characters you interact with are not just NPCs—they are players with their own unique stories. Once you finish your first day, you're free to forge your own path without predefined storylines. <br>The world of Sentou Gakuen is dynamic, with a day/night cycle that affects everything from the availability of shops, accessible zones, to the spawning of mobs.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Social:</strong> Interact with fellow students— they’re also real players just like you! An experience you'd never expect in a traditional Visual Novel.<br></li><li><strong>Visual Novel</strong>: Enjoy story that plays just like a classic Visual Novel. The story mode provides a single-player narrative experience, giving you the feel of a traditional VN, seamlessly blended with the rest of the gameplay.<br></li><li><strong>Unique Zones:</strong> Venture beyond the school's walls and explore a variety of unique zones, some of which might have their own discoveries, challenges, and hidden surprises!<br></li><li><strong>Interactive Combat System:</strong> Enjoy an active, engaging combat system that adds variety to the narrative-heavy gameplay.<br></li><li><strong>PVP</strong>: Takes social interaction to the next level. Locate nearby students via the Investigate tab and challenge them to friendly (or not-so-friendly) duels to see who truly rules the campus.<br></li><li><strong>Character Customization:</strong> Personalize your character with various bases and customization options.<br></li><li><strong>Crafting &amp; Item System:</strong> Craft your own items in Science Room that may boost your attributes or alter your playstyle in unexpected ways.<br></li><li><strong>Dynamic World:</strong> Experience a day/night system that influences certain areas—some may have different mob spawns or special events depending on the time of day, while others remain unchanged with static encounters.<br></li><li><strong>Steam Achievements:</strong> Unlock a variety of Steam achievements as you progress through the game and show off your accomplishments!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Planned Features</h2>Here are some of the planned features on our roadmap, listed in no particular order:  <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Faction Wars:</strong> Choose between two major factions—Yami (闇) or Hikari (光)—or remain a neutral bystander as their war rages on.  <br></li><li><strong>Community Events:</strong> Work together with other students to improve the state of a zone and reap the rewards.  <br></li><li><strong>Clubs and Guilds:</strong> Join a club or create your own. From academic groups to combat clans, there’s always a place for students with a common purpose.  <br></li><li><strong>Co-op Challenges:</strong> Team up with friends and take on co-op missions like investigating the depth of Yamaki Forest and Suoh Lake.  <br></li><li><strong>Steam Workshop Integration:</strong> Far down the roadmap, players can create their own visual novels within the game using a simple scripting language. You’ll have access to in-game resources (backgrounds, character sprites, music) or can upload your own assets. Once created, stories can be shared with other players.  </li></ul><br>Will you uphold the peace in <strong>Sentou Gakuen</strong> or cause more chaos? The story is yours to tell.",
