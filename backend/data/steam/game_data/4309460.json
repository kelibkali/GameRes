Neon heat, dirty money, and a Vice strip that never sleeps. Streets of Miami VR is an open-world VR crime sandbox built around street-level immersion, physical interaction, and the feeling that anything can pop off at any moment. You’re not looking down at Miami—you’re inside it, dealing with people face-to-face and handling problems up close.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4309460/extras/e8c15daa7824471dd2d9168f1db07d13.avif?t=1771694664\" width=640 height=360 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >NEW BLOOD IN MIAMI</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You arrive with no real footing and one lifeline: a cramped bachelor apartment shared with your childhood friend Danny while you try to get established. The early days are survival—small money, tense meetups, under-the-table work—then the city starts testing you. Miami doesn’t hand out wins. It dares you to take them.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4309460/extras/a2ea1a0fefc4b50192c4beacfdd7585c.avif?t=1771694664\" width=640 height=360 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >WORK YOUR WAY IN</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Story mode is a climb through Miami’s criminal ladder. Missions push you from street-level work into bigger operations where everything can turn in seconds: deals that go bad, protection situations, rival problems, raids you have to escape, and jobs that send you to docks, malls, alleys, parties, and safehouses with one simple rule—handle it, then disappear before the heat locks on. You’re not instantly a mob boss. You become someone Miami has to respect, one job at a time.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4309460/extras/badec21f110ce18a66faf816263bae8f.avif?t=1771694664\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4309460/extras_big/badec21f110ce18a66faf816263bae8f.avif?t=1771694664 width=1560 height=878 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A VR SANDBOX BUILT FOR CHAOS</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Outside the main missions, the city is yours. Drive cars, roam the strip, and treat Miami like a living playground. The world is designed to feel physical and reactive—chairs, bottles, and loose props aren’t decoration. If it’s there, you can grab it, swing it, throw it, or use it when things get close and messy. The sandbox leans into physics so the chaos feels earned instead of scripted.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4309460/extras/36c43fdbdd271d39e575eacacdecf935.avif?t=1771694664\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4309460/extras_big/36c43fdbdd271d39e575eacacdecf935.avif?t=1771694664 width=1560 height=878 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >CASH TALKS</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Money isn’t cosmetic here—it’s leverage. The cash you earn changes what you can survive. Buy safe houses, stock up on weapons, grab food, and build yourself into someone who can take higher-risk work and walk away from it.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4309460/extras/1e51177d1044f4f18f034555b1c81a8c.avif?t=1771694664\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4309460/extras_big/1e51177d1044f4f18f034555b1c81a8c.avif?t=1771694664 width=1560 height=878 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >AFTER HOURS: ARCADE &amp; ACTION</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >When you want to breathe—or when you’re looking for distractions and side money—you can hit the arcade and play minigames including darts, basketball, volleyball, ice hockey, and slot machines, plus nightclub gameplay in single-player.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4309460/extras/c630f8783be80e4995c2e966ecbd7fdc.avif?t=1771694664\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4309460/extras_big/c630f8783be80e4995c2e966ecbd7fdc.avif?t=1771694664 width=1560 height=878 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4309460/extras/c115542086d4d931602b375163a31217.avif?t=1771694664\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4309460/extras_big/c115542086d4d931602b375163a31217.avif?t=1771694664 width=1560 height=878 /></span><br>MATURE CONTENT NOTICE</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This game includes mature themes including crime and violence.</p>",
