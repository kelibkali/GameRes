We got them too!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/358150/extras/fc7a8ca38318e30f340ed3e26222186c.avif?t=1756113499\" width=628 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>Piglet Grenade Launcher, 12G Steakout Shotgun</strong> – A popular menu item with grandparents and children alike, the ‘Piglet’ grenade launcher is a classic. A piece of drum-loaded mobile artillery that brings pump-and-thump action to your table and explosive mayhem to the next. Add our Millionaire’s Bacon for a sweet and salty maple treat. When you’re so hungry you feel you could rip a skulldozer in half with your teeth, we suggest ordering the 12G ‘Steakout’ shotgun. Lovingly crafted from organic polymers, layered with locally sourced stainless-steel, the ‘Steakout’ brings the sharp kick you want. Try it with our curly fries for from-the-hip satisfaction.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/358150/extras/54edd787c1810aa38e4a66d169699a4c.avif?t=1756113499\" width=628 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>Did we mention the Flamethrower Mk.1?</strong> – Feel the heat with our fully-loaded, super-sized ‘Flammenwerfer’. Dripping with delicious thickened pyrophoric fluids, smoldering with smokin’ ignition topping and capable of spraying eye-watering hot sauce up to 20 yards, the Flamethrower is one of our most served dishes. See that skin sizzle! Try it with our Asian ‘slaw and a guava sun-tea!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/358150/extras/3bd38e6e16686dd3f14919d4a6fb2257.avif?t=1756113499\" width=628 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>Molotov cocktails and incendiary ammo</strong> – The Molotov cocktail is perhaps the simplest weapon that can call itself a grenade. Nothing more than a breakable bottle of flammable liquid with a ‘fuse’ replaced by a burning rag. It is cheap, simple and highly effective. Enjoy with jalapeño poppers. Other than that, we've also taken the liberty of adding incendiary ammo. Enjoy the Spirited Dragon's Breath rounds and the spicy Incendiary rounds.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/358150/extras/4bd19bc5675aca7f452083c14bdcf571.avif?t=1756113499\" width=628 height=180 /></span><br>•\t<strong>Four new masks</strong> – Four new masks for you and your friends!
