When a strange vampire seeks to disrupt the Confederate defenses, will you help him, hinder him, or consume him?<br><br>In Volume Three, <i>The Fall of Memphis</i> (available as DLC) you find yourself in Memphis, as ex-Confederates loot the public coffers and dismantle the advances of Reconstruction.
