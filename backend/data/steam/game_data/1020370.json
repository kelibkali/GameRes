    "description": "The second pack of 9 new in-game music tracks to enhance Flatspace IIk. Like any in-game music for Flatspace, these will trigger at random when you enter a new sector.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe original Music Pack 2 for Flatspace II was created in 2008, and included lots of game themes from other Cornutopia Games, and tracks from the album Stupid Computer Music, such as China Syndrome. When working on this new pack I wanted to compile music that inspired epic feelings of space exploration and excitement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack includes a full description of the music as a pdf booklet. Here is an outline of the music included:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBlue Nebula<br />\r\nCreated in 2012, Blue Nebula is a short music sting that sets something of an epic scene.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJourney Through Fractional Space<br />\r\nCommissioned by a Flatspace II player, the brief was to create an action tune that crossed two existing tunes from the first game: Catacombs and Cobra.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPandora<br />\r\nCreated in 2013 for the album Bites of Greatness, the idea for the track was to create a catchy piece of music reminiscent of game themes from the 8-bit era.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRock It 99<br />\r\nA high energy track inspired by race-game arcade music. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSonus<br />\r\nThis track paints an ominous picture of a strange electronic world, a perfect evocation of exploring a strange, new frontier.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStrange Angles<br />\r\nAn odd time signature for an unusual piece of music inspired by a sculpture and composed for a 2019 album of ekphrastic music, Music of Poetic Objects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Dark Cliffs<br />\r\nI wanted to include some more expressive, naturalistic music in the pack and The Dark Cliffs is exactly that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Glass Screen<br />\r\nThe Glass Screen is a strange blend of electronic game music and acoustic piano music; music that fades from high excitement into something more gentle and uncertain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrax<br />\r\nA high speed, rip-roaring ride of a tune inspired by television game show themes.",
