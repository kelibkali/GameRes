    "description": "<strong>Cult of the Wind is a game about people who pretend to be airplanes. </strong><br><br><i>&quot;In an unknown time and place, a cult that worships the wreckage of ancient airplanes gathers to mimic the dogfights of old. With the peak of humanity far behind, their world is a mausoleum to a lush and verdant Art Deco past.&quot;</i><br><br>In Cult of the Wind, players compete and cooperate in ritualistic multi-player human dogfights, complete with imaginary weapons, pretend explosions, and airplane noises made with their mouths. Shower your friends in a hail of imaginary bullets and proclaim, &quot;I got you! You have to lie down,&quot; to which they respond, &quot;Nuh-uh, I have a shield.&quot; You argue about whether or not airplanes can have shields, meanwhile some other guy does a cannonball onto your head while whistling. It's great. <br><br>With an intuitive point-and-click level editor you'll be able to craft new levels or modify existing ones, then immediately share them with anyone on a server, even if you aren't the host. You can also craft a personalized appearance for your character with numerous articles of clothing and more. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Simple, robust level editor <br></li><li> Instantly share your creations with others <br></li><li> Character customization <br></li><li> Dozens of imaginary weapons and abilities <br></li><li> Infinitely expandable content <br></li><li> Blindingly high-speed mock combat <br></li><li> Weird noises </li></ul>",
