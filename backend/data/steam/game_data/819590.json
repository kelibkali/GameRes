    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Mythic Monsters 28: Animals</strong></h2><i>Mythic Monsters: Animals</i> brings you over 20 amazing animals that bring a natural touch to your campaign world. Amidst all the dragons, demons, and zombie hordes, nature just keeps on surviving and thriving, and mythic animals are the greatest of nature's champions. These animals are ready to pounce on any hero or villain too arrogant to remember that a great many dangerous beasts never breathed fire or rose from the grave. From CR 1 to 13, you'll find mythic lions, tigers, and bears (oh my!), alongside pestilential scavengers like dire rats and murders of crows, titanic predators like dire crocodiles and giant anacondas, poisonous frogs, venomous snake swarms, flapping furies like the dire bat and pteranodon, prehistoric predators like the axe beak and dire shark and pack hunters like the rat swarm, bat swarm, and wolf pack, and more! On top of over 20 marvelous mythic monsters, we also present alternate rules for making your mythic animals the kings of their kind and for training and riding these mythic animals as allies!<br><i>The Mythic Monsters series</i> from Legendary Games brings you dynamic and exciting mechanics alongside evocative and cinematic new abilities that really help creatures live up to their flavor text, whether they are creatures of real-world myth and legend or creatures born out of the RPG tradition itself. These creatures can work just as well in a non-mythic campaign as they do in one that incorporates the full mythic rules, as you can throw them at your jaded players who think theyve seen it all or know the standard monster stats as well as you do. That look of surprise and What was THAT? will warm any GMs heart. Download this 28-page mythic monster supplement today, and look forward to future releases in the Mythic Monsters line.<br><strong>Requirements:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included Pathfinder ruleset.<br><i>Conversion by:</i><strong> Jay Scheponik</strong><br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Jay Scheponik</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included Pathfinder RPG and D&amp;D 3.5/ OGL ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
