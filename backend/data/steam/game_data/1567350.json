    "description": "This expansion pack is designed to bring your Time Fantasy world into the future! The FUTURE FANTASY collection is based around two themes that integrate together: the modern city and the sci-fi world of tomorrow.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis set includes 25+ new tilesets: everything you need to make a futuristic space station, complete with computer terminals and science equipment. A machine factory with moving conveyer belts, or a damp junkyard with concrete pipes and rusted cars, are perfect locations for dungeons. And of course a future setting isn't complete without a dark cyberpunk city. A more modern city is included too, with roads, highways, and modern-style houses for a suburban town. Modern interiors, with kitchen appliances, TVs, computer desks and more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe collection includes over 50 character sprites, ranging from sci fi soldiers and mechanics to scientists and cyborgs to city police and urban punks. Four new hero characters have fully-animated side-view battlers!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Over 50 new character sprites!<br />\r\n* 12 Modern tilesets!
