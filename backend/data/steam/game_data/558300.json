    "description": "An iconic race from Master of Orion II has returned to conquer the stars!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe eldritch Trilarian join the original 10 races with their own emperors and advisors, new ship hulls and blueprints, and unique perks and personalities. The whole galaxy welcomes their arrival, just in time to face the return of the nefarious Antarans.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the depths of the other-worldly oceans of Trilar, the Trilarian Shoal is governed by the Stinger, half-dictator and half messianic figure. His tentacled subjects worship old gods fashioned around folk tales and cryptic mythology, whose darker undertones clash with their overall friendly disposition towards other races. They are generally willing to coexist with other races and rarely seek out open conflict, but they are capable of quickly turning face when they believe it is the will of their deities to do so.",
