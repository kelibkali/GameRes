    "description": "Have you ever wondered if you could <i>win the lottery</i>?  Here's a chance to test that luck, without losing your shirt in the process.  Lotto Life is an authentic lottery simulator similar to state-run lotteries. <br><br>Welcome to Ys, a modern city under the auspices of Lotto Life Megacorporation.  Every day, in real time, a winning number is drawn for the in-game lottery.  Buy tickets, read the daily newspaper, go to work, and maybe win big!  Fail to pay the rent, though, and you're looking at a new life (or perma-death, if you like) in debtor's prison.<br><br>In line with simulating the wait-and-see experience of playing the lottery, this game plays out at a slow pace. Most days your session can take around 5 minutes to complete, and then real time must pass before more can be done.<br><br>Please note that this is a game, with no actual real-life cash payout in the event of picking a winning ticket.",
