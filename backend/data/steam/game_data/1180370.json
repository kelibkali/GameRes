Build it step by step, learn the consequences of your actions and go beyond what you imagined was possible... Then, and only then, you might stand a chance of making it out alive. Take that as a challenge.<br><br>&quot;- ...no, not Myrth Mountain. Not if we can avoid it.<br><br>- Can we, though?<br><br>- I would give you specific instructions if I could. You know that.<br><br>- My apologies. For how long am I to keep her hidden?<br><br>- I... I'd rather not say. Just keep her safe until it's all over. And after that - bring her here.<br><br>- As you wish.<br><br>- Good. Now, go.<br><br>- Farewell, Lady. It has been a honor.<br><br>- Take care of her for me, Jacob. Farewell.&quot;<strong><strong></strong></strong>",
