    "description": "If you ever played the game &quot;Snake&quot; on your early model Nokia cellphone, then you're familiar with &quot;Nibbler,&quot; the original &quot;snake&quot; game. MAN VS SNAKE tells the story of Tim McVey who, in 1984, on a single quarter (and over 44 hours of non-stop play) was the first person in history to score over one billion points on a video game. 25 years later, rumors of a higher score surface online, attributed to Italian kickboxing champion Enrico Zanetti. This calls into question everything Tim McVey has believed for decades and forces him to make a decision: either set a new world record, or risk losing his legacy forever.",
