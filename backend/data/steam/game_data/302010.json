You are making the final preparations and your ship, The Blue Flamingo, is ready in the hangar.  </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About <strong>The Blue Flamingo</strong>:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Shoot your way through intense levels with swiftly increasing difficulty. Invest your score in upgrades or save your score to gain interest with the risk of losing it all. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This is a game that challenges you to reach the highest possible score, made interesting by an economical system that allows you to invest your score in upgrades, which makes earning more score points easier. But on the other hand, you are rewarded with interest on what is left of your score when you progress to the next level. Therefore, you must make a choice - upgrade and try to regain the score or rely on your skills to beat the increasingly difficult levels. Act wisely to beat your friends and climb up the score table.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Experience a bite-sized shoot 'em up game created entirely with handmade models. A 32-foot long handcrafted model was built for the game, along with countless props and assets that were filmed and photographed. All the effects, rocket flares and explosions were created with firecrackers and pyrotechnics.</p>",
