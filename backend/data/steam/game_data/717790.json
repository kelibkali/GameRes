    "description": "<strong>-- UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT! --</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What Hold Your Own is About:</h2>Insurgents have stolen your land and forced the citizens of your small archipelago to flee or into hiding. A few regroup as a resistance. It will be a long unforgiving battle to match their strength, expect many losses and few hard-won gains. The insurgents will never give up and as you regroup, they will grow stronger and more persistent. Can you make it safe for citizens to return? All you can do is your best to Hold Your Own. <br><br>This game is about finding yourself stranded, nearly empty handed having fled your home, on an island with abandoned towns...the insurgents soon notice your unwelcome presence. You will have to fight the elements, gather resources, and see if you have what it takes to survive. You may encounter hostile insurgents and animals that you'll have to fight in order to claim resources and expand building capabilities. A linear quest line in single player mode is currently in place. Side quests, repeatable quests, and spontaneous events are planned. A player may play the quest line or simply play in sandbox mode with or without tutorials. <br><br>We intend the complexity of the AI to grow as the player grows, presenting a continual challenge of taking...and losing...territory and control over the resources the insurgents so badly want to take for themselves. Experience, levels, and skill points will be earned and spent in more than one category allowing a player to specialize more in one area than another, and teams in MP to specialize even more narrowly if desired.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Key Features</strong>: </h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Single Player, Multi-player is on hold due to technical issues<br></li><li>Tutorial Quest Mode, Quest Mode, Full Sandbox Mode<br></li><li>Character Hunger, Thirst, Body Temperature Mechanics<br></li><li>Base Building<br></li><li>Vehicles<br></li><li>Hunting <br></li><li>Crafting; building components, furniture, workbenches, clothing, ammo and weapons<br></li><li>Food Cooking Mechanics<br></li><li>Power/Electricity Mechanics<br></li><li>Gathering Resources <br></li><li>Mining and refining of ores<br></li><li>Quests, except in Full Sandbox Mode<br></li><li>Friendly NPCs; Trader, Arms Dealer, Pharmacist, Mechanic<br></li><li>Kill AI Enemies <br></li><li>Animal Husbandry <br></li><li>Farming<br></li><li>Day/Night Cycle<br></li><li>Weather Cycle </li></ul><br>Relaunch is here!

After it was abandoned, it was acquired from the original developer and is now being brought back by a small team with the intention of reaching toward a vision of what it might have been. We will be depending on the community to give us feedback about what's working and what's not and what they would like the future of Hold Your Own to look like.",
