Once again — a brave and skilful knight — sets forth in a quest to find the legendary seven Crystals of Light, with a strong will to return alive and unspoiled, to help the Mother Land... Journey onward and let the Life force be with us!&quot;</i><br><br>The game grants you a chance to dive into retro-stylized adventure in a far march to collect all essential artifacts and find a way to return back.
