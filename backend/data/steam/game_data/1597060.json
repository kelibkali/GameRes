You remember that old toy? The one that was supposed to be like a pet in your keychain? The one that never got released?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Well I found it.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >I was just cruising around eBay, and I found a super cheap laptop for sale. The owner acted real weird, refused to take phone calls, only let me talk to him via Email.

Never knew why they didn't release them. They would've made tons.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >But It's here! Seems fully functioning, just like the commercials! I didn't start much, I rushed to Email you first. I know you're into lost media, missing games, that sort of thing. This is right up your alley, right? Still, It's a bit buggy. It definitely seems unfinished, and some of the features straight up don't seem to work, but it's a fun nostalgia trip.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Welp, I'm gonna go play the game for like, 30 minutes before I get bored and forget it exists.
