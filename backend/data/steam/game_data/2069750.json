    "description": "This is a flight simulator in which you control a plane flying over a sea of small islands. The game is organized in a series of 10 levels of increasing difficulty. You have to shoot down all enemy planes and sink all enemy ships in order to win at each level. A radar at the bottom right of the screen allows you to locate all enemies as red dots with regard to your position, which is a black dot at the middle of the radar. Navigate the plane with the arrow keys in typical flight-simulator style: Left and Right for roll and Up and Down for pitch motion. Shoot with the space-bar. That is all! You have no bombs so you have to sink ships by simply shooting at them. However, they can fire missiles at you.",
