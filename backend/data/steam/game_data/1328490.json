    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Welcome to Rico-Jump!</h2><br>Rico-Jump is a single-/multiplayer 3D-Platform racer, where you try to beat the leaderboard by skillfully maneuvering through a futuristic obstacle course.<br>The movement mechanics are similar to the popular e-Sport title &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; and should therefore be familiar to most people.<br>The concept of using the jump-pads and maneuvering mid-air is easy to learn, but be assured, it is hard to master.<br>A map editor offers the possibilities to create your own Rico-Jump courses to challange your friends and the world.<br><br>Additionally, it offers 3 extra game modes, where you are able to throw balls at one another trying push other people off their platforms.<br>This is implemented as a Deathmatch-Mode as well as a Battle Royal-mode, with falling platforms.<br>The third game mode is a coop-based team-game.<br><br>This game is in early &quot;Early Access&quot; as I am developing it besides my full-time job as a hobby.<br>So expect some bugs and unpolished UI.<br><br>I hope you enjoy it and feel free to hit me up with your opinions and suggestions. :)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Current Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Jump through existing or self-made obstacle courses<br></li><li> Global leaderboards (challange your friends high-scores!)<br></li><li> Multiplayer!<br></li><li> Chat<br></li><li> Map editor<br></li><li> Very ugly hats to put on your robot!!</li></ul>",
