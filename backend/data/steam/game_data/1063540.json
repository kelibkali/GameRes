You can be <strong>smooth talker</strong>, <strong>sneaky hacker</strong> or <strong>brawling bully</strong>; or something else - it's your choice: distribute the points in <strong>character creation</strong> and make <strong>decisions when playing</strong>.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1063540/extras/8888dc2d9deabcbda43d6e9305ea310a.poster.avif?t=1743841294\" ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1063540/extras/8888dc2d9deabcbda43d6e9305ea310a.webm?t=1743841294\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>But once the character has been created, be ready for not only abilities but also <strong>limitations</strong>. <br><br>For example, characters with low <strong>CHARM</strong> value will find that often NPCs won't even talk to them because of how repulsive they are; or <strong>speech</strong> - if low, that means you are a shy introvert, unable to initiate the dialogue yourself. Lacking <strong>computer skills</strong> (<i>scitec</i>)? You accidentally crash terminals when trying to use them. Low <i>tinker</i>? Tools might break in your inept hands. Sometimes even too much is not good - too strong (<strong>PHYSICAL</strong>) and you cannot squeeze into vents thus unable to make use of some shortcuts. And so on - your character <strong>stats will significantly affect</strong> your <strong>gameplay style</strong>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Multiple solutions</h2>There are always <strong>multiple ways</strong> to solve problems (<i>quests</i>), usually tied to your character's skills and abilities - play to your character's strengths, and work around its weaknesses. For example, if you cannot <i>convince</i> someone to help you, <i>hack</i> his computer and blackmail him. Or just straight-up <i>pickpocket</i> the guy - all items are always realistically placed in NPC inventories.<br><br><u>Note:</u> there are usually<strong> 3-8 ways to complete a quest</strong> in the game. They can trigger related events in the near future or lead to a different ending in the end slides.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1063540/extras/7a7d67cc705f7d758bd6848eda5cb9c7.poster.avif?t=1743841294\" width=800 height=660 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1063540/extras/7a7d67cc705f7d758bd6848eda5cb9c7.webm?t=1743841294\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1063540/extras/7a7d67cc705f7d758bd6848eda5cb9c7.mp4?t=1743841294\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Choice &amp; Consequence</h2>Your actions, and your decisions <strong>matter to the game world</strong>. Make an enemy, you may need him/her later on. Opt for an easier solution to the current problem and you might have to deal with a bigger problem later. In the end, you will get a <strong>unique game ending</strong> showing you the future fate of your character and those who he/she impacted through gameplay.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Non-linear world</h2>You have an objective but how you approach it - it's up to you; the game map is as open to you as reasonably possible (it's a stranded spaceship after all) and there is no single true path to the end. If you know where to go, and what to do - you can try to sequence break the game. Combine that with multiple solutions to every quest and you've got freedom to spare. <br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1063540/extras/4169314ee671f209ba64de032c8febae.poster.avif?t=1743841294\" width=800 height=582 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1063540/extras/4169314ee671f209ba64de032c8febae.webm?t=1743841294\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1063540/extras/4169314ee671f209ba64de032c8febae.mp4?t=1743841294\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Optional but unlimited violence</h2>You can complete the game without killing anyone.
