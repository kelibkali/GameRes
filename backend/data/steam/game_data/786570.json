Venture into the unknown depths of the universe and discover a gripping tale of a dystopian future that calls your very existence into question.<br><br>Narrated by David Hewlett, star of <i>Stargate</i>, <i>Rise of the Planet of the Apes</i> and the Academy Award-winning <i>The Shape Of Water.</i><br><br>The Alpha Device is a narrative experience focusing on story rather than puzzles or combat. Here, the story is all. You can discover each part of the story at your own pace, but the game is designed to be completed in one sitting - there is no save function and your progress will not be stored if you decide to stop playing.<br><br>Once you start the game, you're totally on your own. There's no main menu, no guidance, no tutorial. Just head towards the green light when you're ready to proceed...",
