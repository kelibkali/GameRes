The entries in the the <i>9-nine- series</i> share the same setting and world, but each entry focuses on a different heroine. <i>9-nine-</i> is a tale of the town of Shiromitsugawa, host to mysterious Artifacts and the superpowers they bestow on their Users. A tale of a brother and sister with a close bond, and also a murder mystery where they hunt down the culprit behind a series of supernatural murders. Each game has an independent story that can be enjoyed on its own. We hope you enjoy the experience that is the <i>9-nine- series.</i><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1033420/extras/21eff62407681f2a5a85611f3171d137.avif?t=1726605629\" width=600 height=200 /></span><br><br>The many-worlds interpretation posits that every random motion produces a novel branching universe. A butterfly flapping its wings rarely means a hurricane across the world, and human choices are no exception—our little everyday choices rarely bring about earth-shattering changes. But for Kakeru Niimi, one of those little decisions is about to make a big difference.<br><br>One night, Kakeru's cheeky little sister Sora asks him to let her stay the night. And from the seemingly inconsequential moment when he caves in and says yes, a new story is born, a hurricane which will upturn both their lives.<br><br>The cadre of evil users, Rig Vega. The noble crew that opposes them, the Valhalla Society. In <i>9-nine-: Episode 2</i>, these two forces will collide, striking new sparks and shattering preconceived notions. Can Kakeru and Sora put an end to this unveiled threat before it destroys them both?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1033420/extras/1b1f1cfc75d4bb8fa5b87ebb677f0fdc.avif?t=1726605629\" width=600 height=200 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Gorgeous art from Izumi Tsubasu (Artist of SakuSaku:Love Blooms with the Cherry Blossoms)<br></li><li>Gripping story written by scenario writer, Kazuki Fumi<br></li><li>Multi part series with independent stories per episode<br></li><li>Two different endings<br></li><li>CG gallery<br></li><li>Music gallery<br></li><li>Movie gallery<br></li><li>FULL Japanese voice acting (Including the main character!)<br></li><li>Japanese, English, and Chinese text.
