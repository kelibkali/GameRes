In the game FatEx Courier Simulator, you will impersonate funny courier that has a ponderous posture, that he could safely work as the security guard of the president alone.<br> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >But believe me that the bodyguard of the president comparing to work at the FatEx company is boring as in an old people's home. FatEx employs only the best - couriers for special tasks! &quot;Sir, there is a flood - I will not deliver a package today!&quot; - At FatEx you will never hear such a text! Couriers in this company are fighting for such packages! P.S. If you ever hear this text from our courier, call Jolka from the board and the courier will be out of work soon!   </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Traffic jams, accidents, fires, dangerous dogs, intrusive neighbors, dangerous neighborhoods, an address in the middle of the desert registered for a dead tree - no problem, add us to wishlist or call to us today because we are bored with ordinary shipments!
