    "description": "Disaster game is a combination of strategy and simulator. Your task in the game is to collect a sufficient amount of research points that appear on the map and use them to unlock the appropriate regulations thanks to which you will avert the impending disaster. Each regulation affects several things at the same time, so you have to balance people's satisfaction, environmentalism and disaster prevention.<br />\r\n Don't forget about the smaller disasters that will appear during your game. You have to reduce their consequences, if you don't do it and you fail, it will have a huge impact on the environment, satisfaction and the power of the disaster.",
