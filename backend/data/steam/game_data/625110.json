    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > Cat &amp; Mouse (5E)</h2>  <strong> Who Do You Trust?</strong><br><i> In the cool streets and blazing bazaars, the word is out: a great treasure has gone missing in the Everlasting City of the Cat, and some very ambitious people have set their sights on it. Many paws and claws are out, and everyone is sniffing around for something rich and strange.</i><br>It's an odd time for a catfolk thief and a gnoll merchant to make very tempting offers to strangers in town. Or, perhaps it's not odd at all. Get caught up in the hunt with Cat and Mouse by Richard Pett and Greg Marks!<br>This 5th Edition adventure for 1st-level characters is a perfect introduction to the Southlands campaign setting, and it fits neatly into any desert city where cats are sacred and rats are cautious and sly.<br>Requires: The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included 5E ruleset.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Wolfgang Baur, and Linda Buth</strong><br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.<br><i> Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i>  Linda Buth[/b]",
