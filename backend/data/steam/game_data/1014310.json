    "description": "Top Torch is a competitive game for two players sharing a single keyboard. The controls are simple and can be learned within seconds, but mastering the intricacies of flight will require much more practice.<br />\r\nAccompanied by a neon-lit, geometric art style and a lush, musical soundscape, Top Torch is centered around superbly satisfying physics-based combat mechanics which contain tactical depth within their mechanical simplicity. It is the first public release from indie developer Colin Hopkins.",
