The strange cave, the occult symbols, the ritual site… and then that strange cube-shaped whispering artifact falling from the sky -it all seemed so real. But you are awake now, and true reality hits like a bucket of cold water: the breakup with Jenny, the move, your uncle Edgar's mysterious disappearance… The doorbell catches you off guard: it is a letter, a testament from no less than your uncle, leaving you his apartment and a warning to get rid of all his manuscripts. It is time to finally go there and try to find some clues. What you don't know yet is that this search will unchain a series of terrifying revelations, secrets that should stay buried forever, and that your worst nightmares will soon come out to the light of day.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1099220/extras/d5481fc2b3d3c6192cd142f41450d337.poster.avif?t=1761581035\" width=664 height=331 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1099220/extras/d5481fc2b3d3c6192cd142f41450d337.webm?t=1761581035\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1099220/extras/0684ff70e4bdf644c0e1e2037cb3f42a.avif?t=1761581035\" width=616 height=346 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Main Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Survive</strong> the perils you will encounter while facing hostile weather conditions, wandering through snowy forests, forgotten dungeons, and other otherworldly locations. <br></li><li> <strong>Explore horrifying places and interact with the items</strong> you will find along your journey to solve puzzles and seek out clues to unravel the mystery.<br></li><li> <strong>Immerse yourself into a powerfully visual world</strong> of unnamed horrors thanks to the CryEngine 5-powered graphics with photogrammetric technology.<br></li><li> <strong>Intensify the Lovecraftian experience with high-quality ambient sounds</strong> and an atmospheric soundtrack extracted from the abyss of your worst fears. <br></li><li> <strong>Delve into the truth of unspeakable secrets behind the past of your uncle</strong>, the protagonist of the game The Land of Pain, and find out the connection between these two games. </li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Quotes</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> David Jaffe (Lead Designer and Game Director of GOD OF WAR on PS2): &quot;The story in Alien Cube is PHENOMENAL.
