    "description": "<strong>Doubles Hard</strong> is a game inspired by a legendary production <strong>Boulder Dash</strong>, created by Peter Liepa and released by First Star Software in 1984. Unlike the original <strong>Doubles Hard</strong> game, diamonds are collected on a three-dimensional board. The player can move up, down, left, right, in and out. There is also 'grab' move. The use of the three-dimensional board has made it possible to design completely new levels that put the game on an even higher complexity level.<br><br>The two-dimensional version of <strong>Boulder Dash</strong> has been implemented in a huge number of ways and enjoyed well-deserved popularity. Adding a third dimension increases the level of difficulty, but also the satisfaction of gameplay.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features of the gameplay:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>45 levels (and one extra)<br></li><li>All classic blocks available (diamonds, boulders, grass, lava, enemies, walls)<br></li><li>A new kind of block: the bomb! <br></li><li>Keyboard and pad support.<br></li><li>The first game referring to <strong>Boulder Dash</strong>, played on a three-dimensional board!</li></ul><br>If you try, there will be chaos on the screen.<br>But this chaos is under control.<br>Under Your control!",
