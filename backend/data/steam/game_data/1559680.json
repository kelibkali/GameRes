There are loads of different items to interact with in the game including (but not limited to): balloons, tanks, eggs, weapons and sports balls (YAY SPORTS).

Search around town and you might just come across a muddy pig waiting to be ridden. How about a nice, friendly race with some friends?<br><br>If you’ve got more exotic tastes, the tourism board of Swindon recommends NOT going into the sewers.
