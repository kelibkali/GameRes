Lead your carefully handcrafted teams in chaotic racing events for glory and fortune. Available on PC (Linux and Mac soon). <strong>Drive</strong>, <strong>Defeat</strong>, <strong>Loot</strong>, <strong>Repeat</strong>!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >DRIVE</h2>&quot;A party of adventurers set to explore the dungeon&quot;. Sounds familiar? <strong>The Underground King</strong> is a classic <strong>RPG adventure</strong> disguised as a racing game.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Driver Types</strong>: Based on classic <strong>RPG</strong> archtypes, we reflavored their background and personality to belong in our world. <strong>Hobo</strong> (Fighter), <strong>Urchins</strong> (Rogue), <strong>Biker</strong> (Paladin), etc. Each driver comes with a unique name, backstory, body type, stats, and a random skill.<br></li><li><strong>Driver Skills</strong>: Each driver comes with their own activatable ability. These are physic-based actions that will help you surpass obstacles, damage enemies, navigate the track, etc.<br></li><li><strong>Vehicle Types</strong>: Vehicles have from 1 up to 4 seats for drivers and proportional bonuses depending on the seat count. Like the drivers, each car comes with a unique identity, random paint job, and random stats.<br></li><li><strong>Team Management</strong>: You are able to assemble multiple teams composed of one vehicle and at least one driver. You can match and sort different combinations to surpass specific challenges (such as building a team to survive a <strong>meteor shower</strong>).</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1198900/extras/998ce23b349e5bc51ab12af382cd0a7c.poster.avif?t=1594900795\" width=616 height=224 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1198900/extras/998ce23b349e5bc51ab12af382cd0a7c.webm?t=1594900795\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1198900/extras/998ce23b349e5bc51ab12af382cd0a7c.mp4?t=1594900795\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >DEFEAT</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Race Tracks</strong>: Procedurally generated terrain designed to challenge you in unique ways. Here are some examples:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>The Countryside</strong>: (Currently implemented) Race in a dangerous obstacle course against other enemy teams.<br></li><li><strong>Freefall</strong>: (In development) All teams fall from a plane. Whoever hits the ground first, wins!<br></li><li><strong>Manhunt</strong>: (In development) Somebody is hunting the contestants. Be the last survivor or become the hunter, to claim the prize.<br></li><li><strong>Tug-o-war</strong>: (In development) One chain, two opposing cars. Pull your weight or get dragged down.<br></li><li><strong>Others</strong>: We have more types planned, thematic to classic adventure tropes, such as <strong>tomb raiding</strong>, <strong>fighting armies of orcs</strong>, <strong>slay the dragon</strong>, etc. </li></ul><br></li><li><strong>Boss Tracks</strong>: (In development) Occasionally, you can challenge a <strong>Boss</strong> in a more difficult version of a normal race track. They might drop <strong>unique Boss Set</strong> items, which when completed, will grant you <strong>special effects</strong> and high stats.<br></li><li><strong>Obstacles &amp; Weather</strong>: Obstacles are designed to hinder you but you can also use them to damage / slow your enemies. The weather influences your speed and acceleration and some spawn dangers (such as <strong>lightning bolts</strong>, <strong>meteor showers</strong>, etc.).<br></li><li><strong>Team</strong> vehicles are physical objects that move throughout the level. They can <strong>collide</strong> with each other, activate traps, break obstacles into pieces, etc.<br></li><li>Domino effects can occur, adding to the <strong>chaotic fun</strong> that is physics-based gameplay!
