    "description": "Night Environment: Sweden for FSX: Steam Edition revolutionizes your night flying experience in Sweden. Using a series of databases, this add-on adds appropriate types of lighting to different kinds of roads and other areas. 100,000s of lights clearly show how both highways and smaller roads alike. Visual navigation at night becomes an absolute joy with this stunning pack!<br><br>The Night Environment database contains an incredible amount of accurate road data, illuminating roads at night which you wouldn’t normally see. Our lights have up to a 60 mile radius, so large urban areas and highway junctions will illuminate all around you as you fly. As the highway lights are raised above the surface and have a lit bitmap below them, a realistic 3D effect is created.<br><br>Night Environment also comes with a configuration tool so you can customize the intensity of your night flying experience.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Full coverage of Sweden.<br></li><li>All major roads and most smaller roads are illuminated.<br></li><li>Compatible with other scenery add-ons (including Orbx FTX and most photoscenery).<br></li><li>Configurable for hardware performance.<br></li><li>Management tool, accessible via the Steam Tools menu, which allows you to toggle and adjust the output of all types of lights.</li></ul>",
