Look no further! <i>Timbertales</i> is the game for you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Timbertales</strong> is a fantasy, turn-based strategy game set in a world where forest animals and insects battle for supremacy. With its unique nature-themed setting, <i>Timbertales</i> offers an exciting departure from the usual strategy tropes. Explore lush forests, face off in tactical battles, and discover a variety of races—more are coming soon!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/673480/extras/5a924620603d6b1dcacbf32a759b7709.poster.avif?t=1733316604\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/673480/extras/5a924620603d6b1dcacbf32a759b7709.webm?t=1733316604\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/673480/extras/5a924620603d6b1dcacbf32a759b7709.mp4?t=1733316604\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >If you're considering purchasing <i>Timbertales</i>, please keep in mind that I’m a passionate strategy gamer and a solo indie developer. While I’ve poured my heart into the game, the campaign is shorter than you might expect from a AAA title, and the overall content isn’t as extensive. What I <i>do</i> offer is a solid, turn-based strategy game with fresh mechanics and a distinctive theme. Best of all, it comes at a price that’s less than what I’d spend on a coffee to go.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >I’m always eager to hear from you, so feel free to contact me directly or engage in the community hub. Your feedback is invaluable, and I’m excited to shape the future of <i>Timbertales</i> based on community input.
