For this purpose, you will have to explore the entire house, collect information and items, without dying, by solving puzzles or confronting monsters.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What makes this game different?</h2>Rather than a classic approach to a 3D horror video game, Au-Delà takes the side of a 2D side view, offering a new experience by making you discover another way to appreciate the dark atmosphere of a horror game. It is especially intended for players who like to explore, solve mysteries and who are not afraid of monsters at night. This game also offers a new idea of ​​gameplay by asking you to build OCD throughout the game, making the atmosphere more oppressive. The whole thing is accompanied by a narrative with creaky humor.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Exploration: </strong>Explore the family house and solve all the mysteries it contains.<br></li><li><strong>Inventory: </strong>A child cannot carry a lot of items, you will have to choose what you want to keep with you.<br></li><li><strong>OCD: </strong>You will have to repeat different actions each time you enter a room, an oversight can potentially cost you your life.<br></li><li><strong>Time: </strong>Time passes as you progress, find your parents before sunrise.<br></li><li><strong>Survival: </strong>Many monsters will attack you, each of them has its own peculiarities and needs to be avoided differently.<br></li><li><strong>Chases: </strong>Some monsters will not give you time to breathe, escape quickly or die.<br></li><li><strong>Dialogs: </strong>Interact with the monsters to get to know them better.<br></li><li><strong>Multiple endings: </strong>Some of your actions will have an influence on the end of the game.<br></li><li><strong>Drawings: </strong>Collect the drawings hidden in the house to unlock the secret ending.</li></ul>",
