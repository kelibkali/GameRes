    "description": "Wiggly boy is an interactive way to test the power of your gaming computer. Phase one: spawn boys at your leisure until your frame rate has had enough, the more boys you can handle the better your setup is. Phase two: the boys are mad and they're going to get you, banana them until you're overcome. It's a simple concept, but the higher the score the more alpha gamer you are.",
