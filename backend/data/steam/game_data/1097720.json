It's entirely text-based—without graphics or sound effects—and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br><br>How will you react to the discovery that you are dead? When the Grim Reaper offers you a way forward, will you take it? Or are you still clinging to the world that you left behind?
