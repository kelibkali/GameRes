A 51% attack against the global cryptocurrency succeeded yesterday, paralysing the entire global economy.<br>To remedy this problem and give itself time to get the system back on track, the Central Bank has decided to put the old physical currency back into circulation.<br>In order to do this, it is asking the banks to equip themselves and to find people qualified in bill verification.<br><br>The Central Bank estimates that the situation will remain in this state for a whole month.<br><br>We will follow this situation closely to keep our loyal readers informed.</i><br><br><strong>Article by Ranf Bardern</strong><br><br>Finally, the opportunity you've been waiting for has come to you. You, notaphilist since your youngest age, will finally be able to make a living out of your passion and who knows, maybe even get rich?<br><br>Armed with your notes on ancient bills, you set up your new business, acquire some tools and open your bank, the day after this news.<br><br>For the next month, you'll have to help the financial system get back on its feet by checking whether the bills deposited in your bank are genuine bills... or fake ones.<br><br>You will start with only your notes and your knowledge. Get a bill, find the error if any, send your expertise to the central bank, gain reputation, get more customers, buy machines from the dozen available to follow the demand and start again.<br>All of this, only for 30 days? Eh, easy, no?<br><br>Maybe Crypto Is Dead, but you are alive and well and ready to work.<br><br><i>Crypto Is Dead could be described as a &quot;Papers, Please&quot;-like. It's a mix of simulation and puzzle game in which you will have to make your bank grow during 30 days. To do so, you will have to check some bills and find out if they are genuine or fake.
