    "description": "Dating a werewolf means you’re left with a litter of kids who turn into cubs when they get upset. You’ve got the silver out of the house, meat in the fridge – but contrary to your ex, you can’t turn into a wolf when the cubs decide to do a runner! You’ve got dog-hair on the sofa, babies howling (literally) into the night, no date, and six kids. But maybe, despite the mayhem, you’ll manage to invite the cute neighbor next door out for coffee...<br><br>Never Date Werewolves is a 100,000-word interactive romance novel by Rebecca Zahabi. It's entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br><br>You’re busy rushing around Lyon, the French city of lights, between your job at a store downtown and the summer school where your children are. But you’ll be damned if you can’t do this single mum thing. You’ll show your ex – and the world! – that you can be a caring mum and still land a date. If you’re looking for humans and a bit of normality, there is the new neighbor next door. But if he’s one of those humans who believe all werewolves are monsters, then it might be difficult to introduce him to the pups. Or there’s the teacher who manages the summer school, always smiling, full of energy and ideas for the kids to try out. Although there might be more to them than meets the eye… After all, everyone has their secrets, and they’ve managed never to be overwhelmed by the pups.<br>One thing is certain: the full moon is coming up, and even if you’re not a wolf, you’ll have the kids ready, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, for the most important hunt of their lives so far.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Play as genderlocked female; date men, women, non-binary individuals, or no one at all!<br></li><li> Land a date – and maybe more – with the cute broody neighbor or the sunny schoolteacher.<br></li><li> Help your kids choose an alpha for their pack, hunt down game under the full moon, and complete a stunning art project for school.<br></li><li> Change the worldviews of people around you, and impact how werewolves are perceived.<br></li><li> Keep your pups under control, hide the silver away from the babysitter, and impress your boss at work – at the same time!</li></ul>",
