    "description": "This Simple LOTO Simulator was developed to provide employers of any size, with the safest and most cost effective method to verify their employee's understanding of the Energy Control Procedure, an integral piece of any Control of Hazardous Energy (lockout/tagout) Program. This Energy Control Procedure can be viewed on a digital screen, and interacts as the user proceeds through the simulator. A check mark will appear next to each step in the corresponding &quot;Sequence of Lockout&quot; and &quot;Release from Lockout&quot;  as the participant completes that task. However, our objectives manager tracks each step and ensures each step is not only completed, but that it is also done in the correct sequence, just like with a real energy control procedure.",
