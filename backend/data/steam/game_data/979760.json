    "description": "HEY, BEFORE YOU PLAY: This game sucks, plain and simple, alright? It's straight up horrendous, abominable even. Play at your own peril.<br />\r\nA big reason for that is that it's been created using this ancient game engine called 3D Rad, which has a ton of limitations and quirks. Of course someone who knows what he's doing could make a decent game out of it, but this was one of the first games i've ever made and i had zero skills and self awareness.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you really have to play a game of mine, pick something more recent, such as 30 Days to be the Best or Mariuccha, Alchemy Queen. They also suck but they don't crash if you press Escape.<br />\r\nLinks:<br />\r\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1908490/30_Days_to_be_the_Best__Ultimate_Edition/<br />\r\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1542010/Mariuccha_Alchemy_Queen/<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnyway, the original description of the game:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe time has finally come! All the most dangerous people in the world have reunited to show off their talents in the annual Paska Battle Style anniversary and you, yes, YOU, will have to shut their big egos off!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay in this super challenging fps boss rush against the 9 (wait, only 9? something's off...) greatest robot pilots to have ever stepped foot in this green beautiful earth! But be careful because they won't just let you humiliate them like nothing, these people didn't gain their accolades by luck!",
