    "description": "Before the modern games of today, games were simple, uncluttered with special effects, easy to play, difficult to master, and the goal for the most part was to simply survive. RetroGunX is just that!<br><br>Take a nostalgic trip down memory lane in this first person arcade shooter game in <strong>VIRTUAL REALITY</strong>. Blast your way though unique waves of enemies and mega bosses, each with their own strategy to defeat you, as you fight to destroy the ominous presence known only as RedSkull, and claim your spot on the High Score Board. The game has a very clean and minimalistic approach to the art style, which is reminiscent of those classic 8-bit games from the 70s.<br><br>In RetroGunX, you truly feel like hero inside the game, literally. You know that feeling you get when you're being watched? At any time, either during the main menu, high score screen or even during the game itself, look behind you to see a mysterious figure that not only watches your every move, but also controls your every move, though the arcade screen.",
