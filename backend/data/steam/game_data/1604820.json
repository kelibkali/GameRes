    "description": "Newtonian Horror is an occult platformer where you can't move or shoot and the only weapon at your disposal is gravity. During the game, you play as Isaac Newton and try to overcome the Evil League who's trying to disprove your theories of gravity. Use your knowledge of gravity to manipulate your environment and save the world!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >IN A TIME BEFORE GRAVITY</h2>The year is 1678, and Isaac Newton hasn't made his groundbreaking discovery about gravity yet. As a result, the world does not yet have gravity. In Newtonian Horror, you will find yourself in a world in disarray, a world where everything floats and chaos reigns. However, you finally have the power to change this. As Newton, you finally begin to see the inner workings of gravity! And with this understanding, you can manipulate gravity fields around you and bend the world to your will.<br><br><br>However, the Evil League is not too happy with your discoveries. The Evil League is a cult that worships the god of ignorance, Koalemos. They will do everything in their power in order to stop you from sharing your discovery of gravity with the rest of the world. It is up to you to fight them with your newfound powers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >USE GRAVITY AS A WEAPON</h2>In Newtonian Horror, you live in a world before gravity! You, Isaac Newton, are the only person who is aware of this, and you use your knowledge to overcome your obstacles. During the game, you only have two powers at your disposal: Gravity and Anti-Gravity! Shoot your gravity magic at objects to create gravity wells to pull or push objects around you. Move around by pulling or pushing yourself and throw your enemies into the deadly weapons lying around. Be careful, you can just as easily harm yourself! Gravity is a cruel mistress...<br><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> A fast-paced physics-based platformer<br></li><li> Cute pixel-art graphics<br></li><li> Over 20 levels<br></li><li> Original soundtrack<br></li><li> And it's free-to-play!</li></ul>",
