For any other weapon you craft, Nanobots will have to materialise a projectile upon firing at a certain cost.<br><br>Crafting weapons is an action that you are able to perform anywhere, even in mid air if for some reason you wish to do so.<br>Weapon elements which you crafted will automatically be added to your roster, enabling you the luxury of being able to combine and switch among them at any time you deem fit for your strategy.<br><br>Both crafting and reconfiguration of your weapon can be achieved swiftly by using dedicated keys on your keyboard separate for elementals, barrels, activation systems and so on.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Players</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/978840/extras/5af29a4a0fe65f2c3fae87f437b90250.avif?t=1655735395\" width=616 height=346 /></span><br><br>Nanobotic universe at the moment allows for two different types of characters that differ only in the way of movement.<br>Blueprints for weapon elements and minions that are available for one are also available for the other, so there aren't any of the class based shenanigans at play here.<br><br>More characters will be introduced in future.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Minions</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/978840/extras/31d5eb7b686d7b414c3f6231241539e2.avif?t=1655735395\" width=616 height=346 /></span><br><br>Nanobotic universe features many blueprints upon which different types of robotic creatures can be crafted out of Nanobots.<br><br>There are different types of minions, defining their way of movement and weapon systems as well as many different types of passive features that are applicable to them.<br><br>Such features include healing properties, generating a protective force field, exploding upon death and so on. Interacting with minions allows for more control of their actions, having them follow you, move to a certain position or to hold that position as long as their health indicators are above zero.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Bank</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/978840/extras/50bf0a7a329987e2a8b1d059a451b958.avif?t=1655735395\" width=616 height=346 /></span><br><br>Each team's base is equipped with a main building which along being the final destruction objective of the opponent's team acts as a Bank as well.<br>It contains shared Nanobots deposited by your teammates for the greater good of the team as well as those acquired by your teammates' minions, and turrets, who have successfully managed to hit their targets.<br><br>You are free to use as many Nanobots from the bank as you need to craft yourself different weapon elements or minions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Destructible Environment</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/978840/extras/bea5703acf93c15bae541353e5178e2c.avif?t=1655735395\" width=616 height=346 /></span><br><br>Being a hostile place, Nanobotic environment contains plenty of destructible and restorable elements.<br>Chances are, if you see something, you can destroy it, and if you can destroy it, you can restore it.<br><br>Reasons for doing so may be accidental or strategic, as some places are normally blocked by barriers or can only be reached by stairs which are, you guessed it, very much destructible.<br><br>Destroying environment elements, as well as restoring them may lead to awards in the way of Nanobots.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Skins</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/978840/extras/3b4ce55c835e68920a3cd2ad33c6fa81.avif?t=1655735395\" width=616 height=346 /></span><br><br>Player characters, minions and weapons come in a variety of different skins, which only affect their appearance, sound, animation, and nothing else.<br><br>Weapon skins are dictated by a Player character skin, but minion skins are available to any Player character skin.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Under the hood</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/978840/extras/8f65ed0c65831714b40da76765337492.avif?t=1655735395\" width=616 height=346 /></span><br><br>Nanobotic will run on dedicated servers.<br>Entirety of the game is simulated on the servers, giving you the best and fairest experience possible.<br><br>Nanobotic encomporates fully procedurally generated levels, as it's composed of smaller building blocks.<br>Random level generation is still in development, so the first version of the Early Acces game will have limited variety when it comes to the randomnes. That limit is a compromise we took to provide smoother and more comprehensive gameplay experience for the players.<br>We will improve on this technology in the future.<br><br>Thanks to the awesomeness of FMOD Studio audio engine, we are able to deliver procedurally generated sounds as well.<br>Each of the sounds you hear, whether those are shot sounds, footsteps, destructions or anything else, sound different every time you hear it.<br>We have developed our own sound occlusion technology, which allows for sounds hidden behind the objects being heard differently from those in the direct line of sight, and the occlusion depends on the barrier's acoustic permeability.<br>We have also developed a solution for dynamic reverb zones, dependant on environment's size and the listeners position relative to the walls.",
