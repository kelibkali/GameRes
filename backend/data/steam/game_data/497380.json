    "description": "Rise is the rhythm jumping game you have been waiting for! Experience our music-driven adventure and aim for the highest score! You can even use your own music to play the game (though beware, any high-beat tracks will potentially make the game far too difficult to clear!)<br><br>Let yourself be taken away by the rhythm of Rise, as this adventure takes you on a journey, aiming for the sky while the landscape is altered around you as the protagonist collects letters for his loved one. You will jump and move across the scenery in platforming style. Place the platforms in the direction you wish to travel and be ready for every beat will bring you closer to the sky and beyond. <br><br>Collect the letters to achieve the highest score. Memory can be troublesome sometimes, so collecting the letters is important to preserving these stories for his loved one, and making sure that others will learn from past experiences. <br><br>Although a game about war, there is no violence and no fighting – no horrors are to be found. It will take you on a journey to discover a true light passing through dark times, unwavering and pure, guiding through the beauty of the human mind.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features / How to play</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Music-beat based Platformer<br></li><li>Choose what platform to use and where to use it, in order to progress and collect items<br></li><li>Use your own music to play the game in Arcade mode<br></li><li>Explore different scenery as it changes while you’re climbing upwards</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Studio Message</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Aik (Wittawat Keawcharoen)<br></li><li>Chloe Bonnet<br></li><li>Matthieu Gueguen<br></li><li>Ciro Duran<br></li><li>Douglas Pennant<br></li><li>Simon Mann<br></li><li>Peter Stewart<br></li><li>Matthias Varlet<br></li><li>Emma Smith</li></ul><br>The game was built using the Luxe engine (an open source framework).
