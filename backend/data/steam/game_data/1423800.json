    "description": "Original soundtrack for Welcome to Elk, the music that accompanies the game's true stories of funny drinking anecdotes and tragic tales of misfortune. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe sprawling 39 track score is composed by Andreas Busk and Troels Nygaard and is their love letter to the island, its people and stories. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith every track from the game included, you can relive Frigg's journey to Elk and the stories she shares with all of its inhabitants; their rituals of joyful community, uneasy banter and quiet moments of grief.",
