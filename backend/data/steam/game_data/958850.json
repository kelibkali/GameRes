    "description": "Get ready for the most intense, high-action PvP experience of the decade. A game made by my community, with me as their slave doing what they command.<br><br>This masterpiece of a game is created LIVE on stream on my Youtube channel (DevAddict). My community decides what I make, and I simply do what they say like a good slave.<br><br>They make me levels, models, sound effects, special effects, and more. They send their creations to me, and I stitch them all together to create the game of their dreams.<br><br><strong>Let It Flow will always be 100% free.</strong> No other game comes close to the experiences you'll get as you destroy your enemies in more than a dozen maps.<br><br>Join the LIVE streams and contribute your creations -- or tell me what to do in chat.
