    "description": "<strong>Smugglers 5 </strong> is the fifth installment in the <strong>turn-based </strong> single-player space trading game series. Will you be a greedy trader, an ambitious fleet pilot or a ruthless pirate? Board enemy ships, manage factories, conquer star systems and forge your own galactic empire - ultimately, your actions will have an impact on a galactic scale.<br><br>This <strong>downloadable content (DLC)</strong> is <strong>a compilation of background stories</strong> for the indie game &quot;Smugglers 5: Secession&quot; and is named after the first of the three stories. Upon installation, the player can choose to play one of three short but dynamic and multiple-pathed background stories, which will lead the player through the game.<br><br>The first story, <strong>&quot;The Smugglers Guild&quot;</strong>, starts with the retirement of your trader father through ill health. There's no money in being an honest trader these days. Smuggling contraband is a risky business, but the rewards are great - especially for those lucky or connected enough to join the exclusive Smugglers Guild. &quot;The Smugglers Guild&quot; is playable with &quot;Smugglers 5: Secession&quot; and &quot;Smugglers 5: Invasion&quot;.<br><br>The second story, <strong>&quot;Thirst For Vengeance&quot;</strong>, recalls the pirate raiders that killed your parents and kidnapped your sister when you were a child. As a graduate of the space academy with a ship of your own, the time has finally come to seek your revenge.<br><br>In the final story, <strong>&quot;Solomon´s Treasure&quot;</strong>, your father dedicated his life to finding the hidden treasure of Solomon McTavish, legendary pirate, and died without success. Perhaps you can do better - but you are not the only one seeking this vast fortune.",
