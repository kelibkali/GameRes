He must try to keep the job and get the hang of it so he can support himself, his wife and their soon-to-be born child.<br><br>This game will demand several skills to ensure success: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Be efficient, but careful. Passengers want a fast service. If you take too long to pick them up they might get mad, which may earn you a penalty. However, if you drive too fast, it's easy to have accidents, which will cost you as well.<br></li><li>Route memorization. Frogvale is not a huge city, but it can seem like a maze sometimes. You'll have to become familiar with the streets and have an idea of the layout of the areas you work in if you want to be able to work at all.<br></li><li>Calculate passengers' change. There's no fancy paying system in these buses. People will pay with cash and expect a correct change from you.<br></li><li>Communicate during the job. Your wife, your boss and your friends will text you and want your reply. It's hard and risky to text and drive, but you'll need to find a chance to do it or your relationships with them will decay.<br></li><li>Solve other small problems that risk your stability. Sometimes street vendors board the bus and annoy your passengers. Sometimes a road is blocked.  Sometimes you get involved with a gang of criminals by accident. You'll have to solve situations like these when they show up.</li></ul><br>Frogvale is intended to be a &quot;cozy&quot; game with a few challenging moments sprinkled throughout. It began as a small personal project and as is often the case, grew a bit beyond its original scope.<br><br>Links:<br><br><br>",
