    "description": "Use ships to attack and destroy enemy space stations in real time.  Navigate through different randomly setup star maps to get to the exit and win.  It's a 2D single player space game that's massively replayable.  No matter how many times you play you'll always have fun and feel dumb for making simple mistakes. There's a wide range of difficulty levels so you can start simple then build your skill to experience the full depth of the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Destroy Enemy Space Stations</h2>Command two groups of ships to attack and destroy enemy space stations. With a bit of practice you'll quickly learn where to place each ship, when to attack what turret and how to counter their abilities, the hard part is mastering it. Only the enemy turrets have abilities so you must be extra focused on using your units as a team and their positioning. Dodge projectiles the best you can and when you make a mistake move a ship to safety and another one in to take some hits.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1283570/extras/Combat_v2_Optimized.gif?t=1601301895\" /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Just Get to the Exit!</h2>Navigate through different randomly setup star maps to get to the exit and win. They have fixed layouts but the rewards and exit point are in randomized locations. Some rewards will help you and some will harm you. The better you think, plan and understand what to do the more prepared you will be. Even a slight difference in the layout of the star map can greatly change how you play it. Don't worry though they are relatively easy to understand you just have to remember to take a moment to stop and think.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1283570/extras/Navigation_Slideshow_Possible_v4.1_-_2020.08.22.gif?t=1601301895\" /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Try the Demo</h2>Want to learn more?  It's small (about 30 MB) and it'll download and open really fast.",
