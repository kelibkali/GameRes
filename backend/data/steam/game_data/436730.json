The game sports more levels, game modes, brick types, bonuses, maluses, tunes, chaos.<br><br>***<br><br><strong>Huenison</strong> is an innovative puzzle-shooter that takes various elements from <strong>Arkanoid</strong>, <strong>BOH</strong>, <strong>Decathlon</strong>, <strong>Dyna Blaster</strong>, <strong>Impossible Mission</strong>, <strong>Oil's Well</strong>, <strong>Pac-Man</strong>, <strong>Pang</strong>, <strong>Qix</strong>, <strong>Slam Tilt</strong>, <strong>Space Invaders</strong>, <strong>Tetris</strong> and <strong>Vital Light</strong>, and puts them together in a hectic arcade mix. All in retro visuals and synthetic sonorities that recall the revered <strong>Commodore 64</strong>'s <strong>SID</strong> chip.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/436730/extras/d8ac88390e483d454e7be92f8b87ee4e.avif?t=1659625415\" width=616 height=96 /></span><br><br>You shoot at falling <strong>bricks</strong> with a <strong>cannon</strong> at the bottom of a <strong>well</strong> (and no, you haven't ever seen anything like this before). Your beams hit bricks only when they are of the <strong>same color</strong>. Hitting a brick produces a <strong>specific effect</strong> depending on the <strong>type of the brick</strong>. Missing bricks will let them accumulate at the bottom of the well, raising the <strong>ground</strong> where the cannon rests - and, on top of that, bringing the <strong>deadly zapper</strong> down, closer to the cannon.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/436730/extras/cae43b2f2e990e9af6e5e8a46054ab65.webp?t=1659625415\" width=616 height=63 /></span><br><br>But this is just the beginning: each level plays differently, more and more brick types are introduced along the way, occasional <strong>disturbances</strong> will suddenly bring some more chaos and lots of <strong>bonuses</strong> will help catch a breath (and score more points)!<br>It's a unique experience that can't be described with words.
