    "description": "You’ve Woken up on an island, a handmade knife embedded in your leg, and your memory is blank. You’re hungry, thirsty, and confused, not knowing how you got there. All you can do is survive, gathering resources to build and eating whatever food you find to stay alive. Coming across dangerous wildlife, craft weapons to try and keep yourself safe. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake your survival skills up a level by playing online where the most crucial threat is other players. You must build a shelter or join clans with others to improve each others survivability with raiding being ordinary and done more often by other players or clans.",
