Members of our team have worked on all previous Rising Storm titles, and also on the <strong>Red Orchestra</strong> franchise. Some of us have been in the biz of developing accessible realism games for the past 15 years. <br><i><strong>It's just what we do best</strong></i>.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059220/extras/c50a5b1c02205e609b771633eb63b026.webp?t=1770980649\" width=600 height=50 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Games in the tactical/mil-sim shooter genre are usually a huge time sink.  Everybody loves Tarkov and Arma but... not everyone can game 100 hours a week, or afford to prep for a match for XYZ minutes - only to <strong><i>die instantly!</i></strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059220/extras/2509fc19718f097d28ea7c5ab470abce.poster.avif?t=1770980649\" width=600 height=124 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059220/extras/2509fc19718f097d28ea7c5ab470abce.webm?t=1770980649\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059220/extras/2509fc19718f097d28ea7c5ab470abce.mp4?t=1770980649\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >'83 is mindful of  your time. It skips the dull parts commonly present in realistic games, takes you to action fast, but does not neglect the lethality of war.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i><strong>You can absolutely still die fast</strong></i>, but should that happen, you're back in business within a minute or two. You might want to avoid the dying though, your squad needs you and every death matters, as the matches are only <strong>30-40 minutes long</strong>!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The tactical aspect of '83 lies in the objective focused flow of every match that <strong>simply requires teamwork to win</strong>. Clutch situations when capturing key objectives on the map can be solved with smart flanks, diversions, or well-timed fire missions, all coordinated across multiple squads within a team.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059220/extras/f2b2f5f224ef43008137259c096c2afa.webp?t=1770980649\" width=600 height=50 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >As with any tactical shooter, the selection of gear matters and can make a difference in '83. However, the point is <i><strong>not</strong></i> to experience gear fear. You can customize your loadout, but there are predefined  classes (including a team commander!) that set some boundaries in order to strike a balance across factions.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" style=\"text-align: center\"><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059220/extras/d87311c26aef5cab029ee30bc74f2c5a.poster.avif?t=1770980649\" width=600 height=124 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059220/extras/d87311c26aef5cab029ee30bc74f2c5a.webm?t=1770980649\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059220/extras/d87311c26aef5cab029ee30bc74f2c5a.mp4?t=1770980649\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >There is a large selection of weapons and other gadgets, each meticulously designed and animated according to their real life counterpart.
