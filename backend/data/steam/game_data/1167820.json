Your task is to keep everything under control while making sure no contraband slips through your fingers. Verify documents, inspect passengers, search luggage, and scan cargo to uncover prohibited goods.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Or break the law, and look for ways to earn some easy money. Let the smugglers through and arrest those who are innocent. Turn a blind eye to contraband and work with the local cartel to gain profit in the blink of an eye. At the end of the day, it’s all about finding the sweetest spot that benefits you the most.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>ROGUELIKE MEETS SIMULATION</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Each day brings new choices. Follow official security procedures or take risky jobs for the cartel. Success earns rewards and upgrades that carry over to your next officer, shaping how you play over time. Every shift is a fresh start built on past decisions, where experience, tools, and mistakes define your future at Caldora Airport.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>OBEY THE RULES...</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Follow daily procedures, verify documents, inspect cargo, and search for hidden goods. Every correct decision earns trust and keeps the chaos of Caldora at bay.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>OR BEND THEM</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Not everyone here plays by the book, including you. Transfer something off the record, or let potential smugglers and restricted items through. Quick money comes easily, but it always comes with a risk.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>TRUST NO ONE</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Whether you are dealing with pesky passengers or stubborn pilots, no one is above inspection. Check pilots’ papers, inspect their cargo, weigh it, and compare it with the documents. You will be surprised how much contraband slips under your nose.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>HOLD THE LINE</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Sometimes life at Caldora Airport is not that simple. Some suspects will not cooperate, and others will do anything to slip away. When things get out of control, your taser and handcuffs might be your last resort.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>SCIENCE WON'T FAIL YOU</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >As you gain experience, so do smugglers. That is when science comes in. Perform chemical tests, scan luggage with X-rays to spot hidden items, and rely on your good old instincts to detect those who try to deceive you. Acquire new tools such as knives, UV lamps, hammers, and crowbars to help you uncover contraband with ease. It is always better to be safe than sorry.</p>",
