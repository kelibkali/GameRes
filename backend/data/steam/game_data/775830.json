    "description": "Chess Sudoku is a simple and calm, but somewhat challenging puzzle game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you will expect from the name, it is based on the well-known games Chess and Sudoku. The main goal is to solve a Sudoku, but the only way to fill in the numbers is by moving a chess piece to the correct field. Every chess piece has a number and a color attached to it, and if it is moved to a spot with the correct matching number, the field gets filled with that number. By also matching the correct colors you get a bonus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are 4 of the known chess pieces: King, Knight, Bishop, Rook (Tower). The King and Knight move just as in chess. The Bishop and Tower, however, can sometimes only move 2 fields at a time, jumping over the one field in between. The Chess pieces are positioned on additional grids, outside of the main Sudoku grid. One extra challenge is to finish the Sudoku with as few moves as possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe puzzles start very simple, but finding the optimal solution can get quite challenging!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game can currently be controlled by only using a mouse.",
