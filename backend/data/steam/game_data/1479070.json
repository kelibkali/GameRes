    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >  Pathfinder 2 RPG - Pathfinder Society Scenario #2-02: Mountain of Sea and Sky</h2>A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 3-6.<br>Venture-Captain Amari Li has called for assistance in establishing new Pathfinder lodges throughout Tian Xia! The mountainous island of Kayajima, in northwestern Minkai, would be an ideal site, as it sits atop a convergence of powerful--though long-dormant--ley lines that could offer valuable protection for a future lodge. Rather than lay claim to the island by force, the Pathfinders must treat with the island's animals and spirits, securing their blessing for a ritual to restore the island's magic and establish the newest Pathfinder lodge.<br><i>  Written by</i><br>Adrian Ng<br>Scenario tags : Envoy's Alliance<br><i>  This product is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
