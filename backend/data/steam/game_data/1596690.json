Players can control and mix various abilities, utilize an array of weapons, and explore breathtaking worlds, making for a diverse and progressive gameplay experience.<br><br>You are a captain of one of the last human arks. In search of a new home for humanity, your vessel was sucked into a black hole. From your position beyond space and time, you witness an unknown race devastating what looks like a habitable solar system. The unknown physics of the black hole endow you with mysterious powers and allow you to exist in parallel worlds. Live, die, and repeat in your quest to conquer at least one of these worlds in the name of mankind.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Game Features</h2><br><strong>• Elaborate, yet randomized level generation</strong><br>Every level is procedurally generated. This means each new restart is a brand-new experience for the player. You will meet different characters and experience new artifacts, weapons, and story pieces. Your unique abilities build across the game’s even in a single game session.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1596690/extras/6e6acd309c102b4c96deb2fa70eb2121.poster.avif?t=1653248910\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1596690/extras/6e6acd309c102b4c96deb2fa70eb2121.webm?t=1653248910\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1596690/extras/6e6acd309c102b4c96deb2fa70eb2121.mp4?t=1653248910\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>• Making the most of VR</strong><br>The advanced controls integrate a wide range of movements.  As you tactically break your way through the enemy hordes and navigate the complex terrain, you’ll need to use your body to cast artifact powers, slam enemies with surrounding objects, cut them into pieces, dodge their attacks, hide behind objects, jump, dash, and more.<br><br><strong>• Micro and macro player progression</strong><br>The combination of power-ups and ability modifiers makes for different experiences. Combine your spells together to get new ones: mix a fireball and a telekinetic push to acquire both an explosive fireball and a fire push. Shape your character and armory between the runs to construct diverse builds for any playstyle.&quot;<br><br><strong>• Explore a looped Sci-Fi world</strong><br>The solar system after alien race expansion is a harsh place, full of harsher occupants. As you progress through each planet, random events and new storyline pieces will help you to infiltrate the black hole and fight back against the intruders. Interconnected levels drive you to explore your surroundings, full of breathtaking landscapes and mysteries like secret rooms, hidden passages, and artifacts.<br><br>The decisions you make through each life and death cycle provide for a story that is uniquely tailored to each player.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1596690/extras/35af3d5d9c4c1192f425286b7ec0bf94.poster.avif?t=1653248910\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1596690/extras/35af3d5d9c4c1192f425286b7ec0bf94.webm?t=1653248910\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1596690/extras/35af3d5d9c4c1192f425286b7ec0bf94.mp4?t=1653248910\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
