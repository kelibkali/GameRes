    "description": "<strong>Welcome to Go Cabbies!GB</strong><br><br>Get yourself behind the wheel of a taxi. Learn the routes and start navigating around a city entirely from your memory. Take a driving test to see if you can advance to the next level and obtain a taxi driver’s licence. Challenge yourself to see if you can complete the routes in the shortest time possible and earn some money as a cabbie along the way. And if, after all that hard work, you wish to take your mind off the map, why not burn some tires in a good old race? Wherever you are off to next, enjoy!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Main features: </h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\t3 game modes: Practice Driving, Taxi Driving, and Street Racing<br></li><li>\tTier-based taxi licence system, with structured taxi fares and career management feature<br></li><li>\tPhotorealistic environment, cars, characters  <br></li><li>\tSurroundings inspired by British urban cities<br></li><li>\tA large accessible driving area<br></li><li>\tSophisticated AI algorithm for traffic and pedestrian control<br></li><li>\t63 streets/243 roads   <br></li><li>\t135 controlled crossroads<br></li><li>\t1 designated taxi cab, 5 non-designated cars, all customisable  <br></li><li>\t6 custom-tuned racing cars, all customisable<br></li><li>\t819 passenger pick-up points with over 200,000 destinations</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Taxi Driving</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/949810/extras/78fcbd29e4ebef1f3ba2efbeefe4d677.avif?t=1724075560\" width=616 height=164 /></span><br><br>The “Taxi Driving” mode enables players to drive around the city, pick up customers and drop them off at their desired destinations. Players are offered a two-tier driving licence where each tier determines which car and taxi tariff are going to be available to the player. At the start of the game, all players are automatically assigned a tier 1 driving licence. This tier allows the player to use non-designated cars only, under the minimum tariff rates. A tier 2 driving licence gives players a wider choice of cars as they can use both non-designated and designated cars, and allows to charge higher tariff rates. To upgrade to a tier 2 licence, the player would need to pass a number of driving tests in the “Practice Driving” mode. Note that where a non-designated car is going to be used along with a tier 2 licence, a minimum tariff will apply. At the customer pick-up point, the estimated fare, distance, and the duration of the drive will be calculated automatically. The required destination point will be shown on the map to assist with planning the best route. This information will be made available to the player before he/she decides whether to accept the hiring. <br>Faults such as collisions, driving very slowly/too fast, driving on red light will attract a penalty deduction from the fare paid. Memory of the location, effective route planning along with accurate and efficient driving are all the keys to success in this game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Practice Driving</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/949810/extras/726b5f7a5949d943f9c6651d2d7b9218.avif?t=1724075560\" width=616 height=164 /></span><br><br>The “Practice Driving” mode can be used to learn and practice the routes before taking a test to obtain a tier 2 taxi driving licence. The player can choose between a number of the pre-defined routes to try and memorise them. During the practice drive, the player will be assisted by a map which will have their chosen route marked with the directional arrows. The system will be capturing and processing the data from the route, such as the driver’s speed and road signs, and will trigger alerts in case of speeding, driving on red light or other driver’s faults. <br>Once in the test, the map with the route shown on it will not be accessible, and penalty points will be given for each driver’s fault. To obtain a tier 2 driving licence, the player will need to successfully complete 6 test routes of choice, with no more than 10 penalty points received for any each of them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Street Racing</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/949810/extras/629d7e2ca05a0015a91f650a8bd88968.avif?t=1724075560\" width=616 height=164 /></span><br><br>Fancy a bit of a high-speed challenge? The “Street Racing” mode gives players the opportunity to use and sharpen their race-driving skills. There is a great range of tracks and cars to choose from while the custom-tuned car specs offer a more dynamic and stimulating driving compared with that in other modes of this game. Now, watch out for that bend coming up… <br><br><strong>Happy driving!</strong>",
