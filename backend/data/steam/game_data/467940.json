    "description": "<strong>Memoir En Code: Reissue</strong> is an <i>autobiographical game album</i>. Designed to be experienced similarly to a music album, this short experimental game explores different bits of the author's life.<br> <br>Divided into different interactive tracks, the game leads the player through the exploration of very personal moments, from the struggle of keeping together a long-distance relationship to the exploration of childhood memories.<br><br><i>Memoir En Code: Reissue was designed, developed and produced by only one person in the attempt to explore autobiography in games.</i><br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>9 interactive tracks with unique gameplay and mood<br></li><li>Sad moments and happy moments<br></li><li>All new graphics, sounds and user interface<br></li><li>9 keys to obtain<br></li><li>1 message<br></li><li>Developer commentary</li></ul><br><br><strong><u>Recommendations</u></strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Play multiple times to fully experience the game. ~40 minutes for a first playthrough, to be extended in order to reach the game's ending.<br></li><li>Use headphones for a better experience.</li></ul><br><strong><u>F.A.Q.</u></strong><br><br><strong>How does Reissue differ from the original Memoir En Code released in 2015?</strong><br>The game features all new graphics, interface, and parts of it have been re-designed. Reissue also includes a new final track to give closure to the game, plus the dev commentary. Take it as a sort of HD Remaster Extended Director's Cut edition. <br><br><strong>Should I buy this game?</strong><br>If you like experimental games, yes.<br>If you don't like experimental games, maybe.<br>If you give more value to content than length, yes.<br>If you give more value to length than content, no.<br><br><strong>Can I put a Let's Play video on YouTube?</strong><br>Yes BUT, considering that the game is fairly short, I'd appreciate if you could at least avoid recording the new (last) track called Lei Disse as well as the solution of Memoir De Code.",
