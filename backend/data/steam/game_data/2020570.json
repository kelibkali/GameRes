    "description": "Welcome to the world of Charlie and Friends! Currently looking for a new caretaker for our beloved characters: Charlie the Cat, Hilda the Hyena, Sammy the Snake, and Rosy the Rabbit. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour job is to take care of our wonderful characters by feeding them, cleaning after them, fixing anything they broke, and uploading daily records of the characters. However, your job won't be that easy though since the characters like to wander around the building and they may interrupt you. Plus there seems to be something else happening in the background of the company you work for. Can you survive your work week and solve the mystery of what's happening?",
