As such, it is likely to still have a number of technical issues, which were originally meant to be handled post-release via free updates.  This was not intended to be the final build.  However, contrary to our original intent, there is no longer an update in development to resolve technical issues with this project.  Various issues have forced us to put this project aside until further notice.",
