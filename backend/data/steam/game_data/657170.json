    "description": "<strong>Tactical multiplayer chaos.</strong><br>That's what would describe this game in 3 words. It's fast, it's messy, it's challenging. Do you like blowing up zombies to bits together with your friends? Protecting your base from the enemy team? Grab your gear and start the chaos!<br><br>Shoot 'm Up is a fast-paced tactical shooter with lots of different game modes. The game features a customizable server, offline gameplay, a short campaign that acts as a tutorial, LAN and multiplayer action, custom maps (with a map editor), smooth gameplay, stunning graphics and awesome effects. You can currently try the Deathmatch, capture the flag, or team-deathmatch mode - just shoot at each other or at bots using one of the 18 different weapons; or you can jump into co-op zombie survival mode so you and your friends can hold off as many zombies as you can!<br><br><strong>User feedback</strong><br>I love to hear your ideas and experiences! I'm online most of the time on Discord (  ) and I'm happy to hear feature requests and ideas.<br><br><strong>Current features</strong><br>- Campaign mode (Albeit short currently)<br>- Co-op zombie survival mode, with deployables &amp; buyable upgrades<br>- Map &amp; asset editor - allowing you to make, play, and host your own maps.<br>- Team deathmatch<br>- Capture the flag<br>- Multi-team deathmatch<br>- Dedicated servers<br>- A big arsenal of weaponry<br><br><strong>Development</strong><br>The game has been in development for quite a while, and I think I'm at a solid base right now. This doesn't mean it's done! The game might undergo updates as we go, from bugfixes to new content to performance improvements. I'm a solo developer that hates sluggish games, and gameplay is the number one priority for me. Getting the game to run great and feel smooth on every machine is an important goal for me. <br><br>So far I've been making this game on my own, with testing help of the closed-beta community and the map-building skills from a friend.",
