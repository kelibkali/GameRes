That’s why we decided to make the game free—so anyone who’s curious can give it a try.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >We’re now called <strong>Professional Villains</strong> and have learned a lot since making this game. We hope you’ll check out our other titles, such as <i>Security: The Horrible Nights</i>, <i>Anglerfish</i>, or <i>The ER: Patient Typhon</i>. 😊<br>- John &amp; Maria<br><br>Get into the Christmas spirit with the world’s biggest goblin in a blast from the past, 2D arcade shoot 'em up. Fight evil pet pinetrees from Siberia. Air-battle on a deadly pooping Rudolf. Float around in space and much much more crazy stuff.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/558440/extras/a73aee3a16dbf3ee9491cc603e45c5c6.poster.avif?t=1757251940\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/558440/extras/a73aee3a16dbf3ee9491cc603e45c5c6.webm?t=1757251940\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/558440/extras/a73aee3a16dbf3ee9491cc603e45c5c6.mp4?t=1757251940\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Play through the whole adventure locally with a friend</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Unique weapons and power-ups (like shots that grow and shrink)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Giant Goblin will comment on if he thinks you control him well or badly</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Shoot an innocent bird just because you are a jerk</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Don’t forget the deadly pooping reindeer</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/558440/extras/c77a32833f802c9e68dc6ad8ad47364a.poster.avif?t=1757251940\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/558440/extras/c77a32833f802c9e68dc6ad8ad47364a.webm?t=1757251940\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/558440/extras/c77a32833f802c9e68dc6ad8ad47364a.mp4?t=1757251940\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >&quot;If you’re after a festive, arcade shooter that truly challenges all that play, then look no future than The Night Christmas Ended.
