    "description": "<strong>Bunnyrama</strong> is an unique and challenging puzzle adventure game where your goal is to lead the old man through the magical forest full of huge bunnies. Each level is a labyrinth with different puzzles, and only one exit. Bunnies will help you, carry and stack them properly, use their unique features to build your way to the portal, and help the old man find his way home.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/567210/extras/01730235a175b19bc78e51f22c53ce31.poster.avif?t=1669722595\" width=480 height=128 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/567210/extras/01730235a175b19bc78e51f22c53ce31.webm?t=1669722595\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/567210/extras/01730235a175b19bc78e51f22c53ce31.mp4?t=1669722595\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Puzzle mechanics is easy to get, but complexity growing as more elements added in each level.

Anyone curious about the Bunnyrama story? Strange… but who we are to judge you? So please, make yourselves comfortable, and I will  begin...<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/567210/extras/991dddde61d842349924e2d8487ea52c.avif?t=1669722595\" width=600 height=200 /></span><br><br>A long time ago and far far away (well... maybe not so long and not so far, but humor me, it sounds much more dramatic this way). In his small wooden house, lived an old man. His name is not important because even he didn't remember it.<br><br>His house was deep in the forest, and he loved nature and animals. Sadly when he tried to sing to them, those ungrateful creatures scattered in all directions and attempted to gnaw off their own ears (he was not a beautiful princess with the voice of a songbird). But the old man was a very amiable person, so he didn’t care and tried to help every little creature in the forest. Especially he loved hares and rabbits, because they are so cute (aren’t they?..).<br><br>One very rainy day, a flood came to the forest. All the poor little creatures were trapped on a small island.  Even though he was drunk, (well what would you do if you’d lived alone in the forest?) our old man jumped onto his raft...<br><br>No one knows what happened next. Did he really see the white rabbit? or it was a result of his new recipe?… But here the true story begins…<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/567210/extras/8b7a85f27a04da22534f1a167fe73b9a.avif?t=1669722595\" width=600 height=90 /></span>",
