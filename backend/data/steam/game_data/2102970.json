    "description": "Escape is a single player horror game developed by two new indie developers. We wanted to make a tangible product that allowed us to focus our learning to end with a complete product - Escape is the result of that. Our goal was to manage the scope and practice developing a game from start to finish without getting lost in the infinite pool of ideas. We set out to make a maze like game with our own twists and atmosphere. <br>Thank you for checking us out and if you're interested in leaving feedback or following development on this and other titles, be sure to check out our discord (found in the links on this Steam page)!<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2102970/extras/c235d168ee47d1342cb4b7f96583e747.poster.avif?t=1661805672\" width=600 height=232 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2102970/extras/c235d168ee47d1342cb4b7f96583e747.webm?t=1661805672\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2102970/extras/c235d168ee47d1342cb4b7f96583e747.mp4?t=1661805672\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Gameplay</strong><br>Players will find themselves trapped in a maze and their only way out is forward.
