She came to climb up the dangerous political ladder against other women eying the same, powerful position of Matriarch. But unbeknownst to the world, you two have the power of foresight, and can predict the happenings of the world around you. Help those who need it immediately, or focus on the future and potentially help a wider range of people. The path is yours to walk. Or chuck her into a tragic death run.

No two playthroughs are the same, and your friends may have very different experiences with the characters than you do!<br></li><li>Choices are not binary, and one good deed does not wash out the bad, nor the bad the good.<br></li><li>Who let me be in charge of how many choices you get in this game? Apparently there's over 600 menu choices?<br></li><li>Xjena has just as much a personality as you, so she interacts with the world not as a silent protagonist, but a woman with plenty agency.<br></li><li>The world and its characters will not revolve around Xjena or her schedule. It's up to the player to be involved in their lives.<br></li><li>The game engine said there's over 200,000 words. But let's say there's 75k and assume 125k of that is from coding branching paths, probably.<br></li><li>Reading is good for you anyways.<br></li><li>The writer for this description page is also the head and main writer for the game's script. This is either a bane or a boon, depending on the reader.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/603660/extras/3f72d4f393eedecb66417bb73d0092fe.avif?t=1649002790\" width=618 height=250 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Decipher a tricky high fantasy political mystery that mixes replayability, lore, and clear answers in a way unique to the genre.<br></li><li>The mystery is tricky, but quite fair! And the more you piece together, the more the world around Xjena makes sense!<br></li><li>An easily digestible lore that allows you to choose between an abundance of information vs keeping things strictly story/character driven.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/603660/extras/ba883f316362df8cfe37b89891c4721f.avif?t=1649002790\" width=618 height=250 /></span><br></li><li>In a stunt we'll probably, hopefully never do again, you can date/befriend 12 full “Romance/Friend” routes that are <strong>NOT</strong> blocked!<br></li><li>You can romance multiple people in one playthrough without worrying about being locked out from someone. Why?<br></li><li> Because romanceable characters interact with each other due to an <i>incredibly </i>intricate affection system that allows and encourage polyamorous options.<br></li><li> ^ End me.<br></li><li>Yes you can date the guys, too! Not just the ladies!<br></li><li> Romance options can turn into enemy options for certain playthroughs... and it can uh, Go Places. Like one of them killing Xjena real early.<br></li><li> 140 minute soundtrack with familiar Jazzy vibes, niche ambiance and synth-heavy tracks, and genres I'm pretty sure the composer (see: me) made up.<br></li><li> Over 100 special illustrations for important scenes and romantic/platonic moments. See the 4th bullet point for this segment.<br></li><li>4 different endings with a mind-numbingly long list of ways to reach them.<br></li><li>Your choices being referenced and rewarded/punished more times than you can count. More times than we can count too, if we're being brutally honest. </li></ul><br>Jump into the lore today! The water is fine. I hear it's a bit deep, but Xjena is here to make your journey into Xal as seamless as possible! Solve the mysteries, make your new friends smile, and go on a journey that will stick with you for a long, long time.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/603660/extras/702e5814e7d7c0fe21eec6c1724c1d35.avif?t=1649002790\" width=618 height=250 /></span>",
