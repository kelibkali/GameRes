    "description": "ExtremeRetroArena is a classic arcade style shoot 'em up where you must fly around and use spells to avoid contact with enemy spacecraft.<br>There are multiple different map sizes to choose from, making it much harder on the smaller sizes. In order to avoid the enemies crashing into you,<br>four different spells exist, which allows you to destroy the enemies and stop them from building up to a critical mass. <br>The game uses a modernized and stylized version of classic arcade graphics and effects to give the look and feel of old school arcade games.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Spells</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tImmiediatley create a large explosion at your location, instantly killing all enemies within it.<br></li><li>\tFirst create an electro-magnetic pulse at your location, killing enemies instantly. Second, leave behind a bomb on the ground which will emmit another electro-magnetic pulse after 3 seconds.<br></li><li>\tInstantly teleport to your current cursor location, destroying nearby enemies as you arrive.<br></li><li>\tRemove all spell cooldowns for 10 seconds.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Enemy Types</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tA slow moving spacecraft.<br></li><li>\tA fast moving spacraft.<br></li><li>\tA fast moving spacecraft that will dash quickly at your ship once it gets in range.<br></li><li>\tA very fast moving spacecraft that turns into a bomb once it gets close to the player. The bomb detonates after 3 seconds, killing you if you are too close.<br></li><li>\tAn extremely fast moving Spacecraft that must be killed very quickly.</li></ul><br>Map sizes are Large, Medium and Small. The small map is significantly more difficult than the large map, so it's advised that<br>you start off by playing the large map first. Once you can survive for a decent amount of time, then progress onto the smaller maps.",
