    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >  D&amp;D Classics: FRC2 Curse of the Azure Bonds</h2><i>  Day breaks, and the crowing of a distant rooster wakes you from an all-too-short sleep. Another day for adventure, you think as you arise - but then you stop short. You, and all of your companions, have an elaborate blue tattoo covering most of your sword arm!</i><br>And there is more to these marks than a drunken prank. As you try to find out the source and meaning of your new adornment, you are drawn further and further into danger and mystery. Will you become a pawn in somebody else's power game, or will you fight for your freedom and individuality?<br><i>  Curse of the Azure Bonds</i>  is an adventure set in the Forgotten Realms game word for the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition game. It is based on the best-selling novel,<br><i>  Azure Bonds</i>  , by Jeff Grubb and Kate Novak.<br><i>  We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today. Some older content may reflect ethnic, racial, and gender prejudice that were commonplace in American society at that time. These depictions were wrong then and are wrong today. This content is presented as it was originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed. Dungeons &amp; Dragons teaches that diversity is a strength, and we strive to make our D&amp;D products as welcoming and inclusive as possible. This part of our work will never end.</i><br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Mike Wilson, and Terry Buckingham</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the D&amp;D Classics - AD&amp;D 1E/2E ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
