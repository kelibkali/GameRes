Aaaand, cats have keyboards. The list goes on. <i>Yeah, I'm being serious right now.</i> <strong><i>No, put that straitjacket away.</i></strong><br><br>The game's a visual novel where you wander around the town of Dialtown, seeking <i>romance, </i>all because you want someone to pay you into a funfair, all so you can find <strong>a dank pit in which to lay your eggs. </strong><i>Yeah. </i> <br><br>There's several dateable protagonists, from <strong>Karen</strong>, a bored bank-teller printer who's extremely dissatisfied with her life and just wants to feel things again, to <strong>Randy</strong>, who juggles working as an operator for a local phone sex hotline and working as a bird-wrangler for animal-control.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><i><strong>Such is the life of Randy.</strong></i></h2><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1035990/extras/46870e5faf75a8e82c0b01888a7aa036.avif?t=1762878764\" width=550 height=196 /></span><br><br>Anyhoo, <br><strong><i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Dialtown has many features, including:</h2></i></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>A unique visual style</strong> compromised of real world photography, photo-realistic 3d models and 2d illustrations.<br></li><li><strong>Strong comedic writing that stands out from other dating sims </strong>on the market.
