    "description": "Explore the Cenote in Expedia Labs VR. The experience takes you into the caves of similar cenotes that are found in the Yucatan Peninsula. Although a simulation of the true experience, you can learn facts and where you could find real cenotes if you wish to travel in the future. Step into the water to watch the fish swim around you or stand on rocks as the waterfall gently splashes your face. The cenote is designed for both the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive. <br><strong><br>If you want to experience the real thing, find the code inside and get the adventure going with $10 off a real-life tour of the Yucatán Peninsula, exclusively for Expedia members! </strong><br><br>Presented by Expedia Labs VR.",
