    "description": "This is my first published game, made using Unity and Playmaker.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuper cube smash is a rhythmic action game that generates music as you play. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is set on the mysterious ancient spaceship 'The Dwarfstone' where the most peculiar and unfortunate of events have occurred. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour mission is to find the core of the ship and destroy the source of the acidic alien cube swarm, before it grows to a concentration beyond your control. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuper Cube Smash is a very difficult single player challenge, with an official steam leader board.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures...<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Rhythmic step-sequencer; putting everything in time to the rhythm, even your gun shots.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Dark, moody and colourful aesthetic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Responsive, familiar controls (wasd and mouse or Xbox pad).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-17 tough hand crafted levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Non-linear completion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Adaptive difficulty. The more you complete and level up, the harder it gets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-A shooting game without gore (child friendly).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Hardcore mode (because the game isn't hard enough already). Granting the opportunity for higher scores.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuper cube smash was created solely by Lewis Fitzjohn over the course of 2014 - 2015.<br />\r\nSteam online leader-board functionality implemented by David Jordan.",
