    "description": "In this game, you must take down an empire of evil, corrupt space ships, and restore peace to the universe.<br>To do this, you must take out as many ships as you can, as well as defeat the emperor, who is hiding out in an other dimension, in an arena, top down shooter-style game made entirely by 1 person.<br><br>This game is a retro-style top down shooter space arena fighter game that will provide you with [hopefully] hours of hilarious content.<br>There are three main game modes to this game. The first, which is available by default, is a &quot;story mode&quot; this mode allows you to play the game with an objective in mind. By completing this game mode, you will unlock two additional secret game modes. Both of which add a unique twist to the game<br><br>The game also includes a full modding API. The modding instruction document is about 30 pages long, and is filled with Python-based modding. The API is so open, and free, you could technically build an entirely different game on top of the original game! The modding allows access to a few Python modules, including Pygame, random, time, and TkInter! A complete list can be found in the modding API documentation.<br><br>If you are new to the game, there is a skip-able tutorial where you can learn the basic game mechanics. I would highly recommend that you go through this before playing!<br><br>What's more is that there is over 30 seconds of credits you can watch over, and over again!<br><br>Good luck, and may the stars align in your favor!",
