    "description": "Art Your Brains - not too colorful, but interesting puzzle game in which you will find unique levels, interesting quests and objects with unusual physics. Arrows, pencils, weapons, enemies, friends. Whatever gets outside the world will definitely come back, because the world is really round. Place boxes, remove boxes, interact with objects, shoot, destroy enemies, jump, fall. Do whatever comes into your head and enjoy the game. Remember your main goal - to find all the keys and exterminate the enemies, in order to then free the little green man from this unpredictable painted world. Challenge yourself and be sure to complete your goal!",
