    "description": "Time Break is a game set in an alternate reality where you are a police officer training to serve the public with your standard issue time slowing and rewind watch. Assess, resume time, and stop the crime. Keep the city safe from a deadly group against the manipulation of time. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery level will start in stopped time. This allows you to survey the environment. Take in what crime is happening and what you can use to stop it. Maybe it's throwing a trash can lid at a robber or exploding a can of spray paint with a lighter. Each level is filled with multiple solutions to solve each scenario. When you're ready, resume the flow of time and stop the crime using whatever you can in the environment. If you fail, the level automatically rewinds time back to the start of the crime. Try and try again until you successfully stop the crime.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTime Break is a student game, made in about 7 months, through the University of Utah Entertainment Arts and Engineering Program.",
