    "description": "Official Soundtrack for the game Tooth and Tail, original score by Austin Wintory.<br><br>Over an hour of music, including bonus tracks by:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Eli Bishop<br></li><li>Hyperduck Soundworks<br></li><li>Darren Korb<br></li><li>John Robert Matz<br></li><li>Kristin Naigus<br></li><li>Salome Scheidegger</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Liner Notes</h2>Austin: &quot;We want to make a game about war, but we want to make it fun.  What were some fun wars?&quot;<br><br>Andy: &quot;World War One was fun.  So was the Russian Revolution.  Super fun.&quot;<br>Austin: &quot;True, true.  And so is starvation.  And cannibalism.  Really goofy stuff.&quot;<br>Andy: &quot;So our game is all about building tension before short explosive bursts of action… maybe we should use tangos and latin dance music as the basis for things?  Real Time Strategy is essentially ballroom dancing.&quot;<br>Austin: &quot;Yeah, and we can play it all using early 20th century Russian instruments.  That makes sense.&quot;<br>Andy: &quot;Except our game is wild and raucous, so let's play the instruments drunkenly.&quot;<br>Austin: &quot;Will do.&quot;<br><br>That is how this album came to be.
