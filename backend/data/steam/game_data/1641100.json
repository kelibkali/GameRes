    "description": "Model Railway Easily 2 with fully functional terrain editor!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can build highly detailed and functional model railway layouts in this game.<br />\r\nYou can select the size of your layout and edit the terrain by painting it using different textures and creating hills, rivers, lakes, platforms, slopes, or select different premade terrain types. Then populate the layout with beautiful 3D models of engines, wagons, buildings, plants etc.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreating the track layout is very easy with the self explaining menus, which offer always only the possible actions during the use. The track can climb up to the hills or go through them with tunnels. The length of the track is practically unlimited. You can add as many switches as you want, only your fantasy limits the complexity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPut engines and wagons on the built track and just push them with your finger, and they start to move. They will travel the prepared track and stop automatically at the placed stations. If a train reaches and end of the track, it will stop, and move backward after a few seconds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdd different houses, buildings, plants, roads to increase the reality of your layout, and enjoy the beautiful details of all 3D models.",
