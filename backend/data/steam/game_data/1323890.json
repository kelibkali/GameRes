Often all one has, is the power of words. And it is your choice to reach out or to alienate. Like in real life, you don't always know how your words will affect the other. Or what future they hold.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Emotional storytelling</h2>is something that we are both passionate and curious about. Players identify deeply with characters of flesh and blood that they can relate to. Through complex characters we´re able to tell stories that trigger a universal set of emotions.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1323890/extras/552f90c281cb321db9a758450cfeba2f.webp?t=1652338255\" width=616 height=20 /></span><br>Created by like Charlie, the team behind the award-winning story exploration game Marie's Room.",
