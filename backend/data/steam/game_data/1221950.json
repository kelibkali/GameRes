Vampires have finally been exposed, and although your existence is presently tolerated, your constant thirst for blood is not. You arrived in the one city willing to promise vampires a fresh start, only to find suspicion and paranoia waiting on its dark streets. But death could not hold you, and fear will not hold you back.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >When the sun sets, outcasts <i><strong>rise</strong>.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >It’s time to seize the night by its throat. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1221950/extras/1ec92be2d2f1d3f5ab474d75811e3ab1.avif?t=1760356895\" alt=\"Welcome To Nighthawks\" width=1476 height=100 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1221950/extras/3fddd2e73965d4981abd29e45dc58b2c.avif?t=1760356895\" alt=\"&amp;quot;What&#039;s it like?

Befriend and recruit fellow outcasts, digging deep into their stories and harnessing their skills. Explore a fully voiced, lavishly written world of dark shadows and bright neon, where your every decision could push the world towards a bold united future... or a whole new era of fear and paranoia.     </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >In Nighthawks, death is what you make it. Climb from rags to riches as a modern vampire in a city filled with horror and humour, embracing your dark instincts or proving to the world that even the darkest nights can lead to a brighter tomorrow. A bit of both, perhaps? Race against the sunrise while exploring a city filled with stories and opportunities, and meeting a fully-voiced cast of over 80 characters looking to make a fresh start in the modern nights. Turn your nightclub into a haven of found family and new beginnings, or simply your personal hunting ground. Fight to resist your predator instincts, or stalk the city streets in search of fresh prey. Either way, prepare to claw a path from the gutter to the heights of power and influence, until the fate of humans and vampires alike sits within your grasp.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1221950/extras/a9ef98678339ba0f01f22010978d2f5e.avif?t=1760356895\" alt=\"Key Features\" width=1476 height=100 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1221950/extras/6a47d9776f37d8178aee51ef3c6edeac.avif?t=1760356895\" alt=\"&amp;quot;Revenge, my friend, is a fool&#039;s errand... which does not make it any less satisfying.
