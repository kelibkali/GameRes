Nestled within its fertile plains lay Zalumi, the grand capital, a city shimmering with wealth and guarded by four noble houses – the Sutherlands, the Pantelakos, the Totens, and the Rileys.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Yet, a shadow crept upon Zenman's grandeur. The Martia Kingdom, once scattered tribes, now a bloodthirsty force, glared down from the north, their hunger for conquest a constant threat. Southward, the Amazail Kingdom, cloaked in an air of deceptive power, watched with silent ambition.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Each year, these vassal kingdoms paid tribute to Zenman – a heavy burden of gold, weapons, and even the most beautiful women within their borders. Yet, whispers of discontent grew louder with each passing season. Both Martia and Amazail yearned to break free from Zenman's iron grip.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Then, a tremor shook the very foundation of Zenman's power. Leonardo, the sole heir to the Sutherland house, vanished without a trace. Panic rippled through Zalumi, a stark reminder of the empire's growing vulnerability. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Meanwhile, whispers reached the Zenman court from a shadowy organization known as the Iron Eagle – both Martia and Amazail were plotting. An alliance brewed in the north and south, a storm threatening to engulf the once-mighty Zenman Empire.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1124210/extras/B5379.PNG?t=1753379468\" /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Brace yourself for an unforgettable journey filled with twists, treasures, and triumphs.
