    "description": "Welcome to the operating room, doctor. The patient needs an urgent respiration recovery! The patient was anesthetized by infiltration. At the beginning of each manipulation, a tool and type of action will be proposed. While the tool is not selected - remember the animation on the scene. After selecting the tool, the animation disappears. Manipulation is passed when the action is completed. A sign of the fact that the manipulation is performed correctly is the change of the hint.",
