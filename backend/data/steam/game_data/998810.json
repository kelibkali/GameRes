    "description": "It’s finally here: the last volume of <i>Hiveswap Friendsim</i>. We’ve had a long, memorable journey together, haven’t we? Around now is typically when we’d play a slideshow highlighting all your best moments, but we aren’t Facebook. We don’t feed off of personal information, just your tears. Your sweet, sweet tears. So instead we’ll invite you to take a second and visualize within your mind’s eye snapshots of you being cradled close to the bosom of a massive murder clown. Or how about accidentally killing a guy with your ass? Good times.<br><br>What will you do now, without a new volume to play every alternating Friday? Perhaps this is a good opportunity to check out that “outside” we’ve heard so much about. Or to take up a new hobby, like stamp collecting. <br><br>But before you embark on your new, Friendsim-less life, we’ve still got two (three?) more new chums for you to pal up with. What better time to party like it’s the end of the line? Or enjoy some, uhh, other non-specific yet quality entertainments that definitely aren’t dangerous at all? <br><br>Maybe the real friends were the injuries we accrued along the way.<br><br>---<br><br>You just crash-landed on Alternia, and you’re <strong>DESPERATE</strong> for friendship! Anyone will do...wait, who are those two trolls approaching you?<br><br>The <i>Hiveswap Friendsim</i> is a quick, loosely-canonical visual novel adventure following the efforts of the unnamed protagonist (that’s you!) to survive and maybe even thrive on the harsh surface of ALTERNIA. Set in the time of <i>Hiveswap: Act 1</i>, this episodic visual novel’s opening volume, written by <i>Homestuck</i> creator <strong>Andrew Hussie</strong>, is sure to satisfy <i>Homestuck</i> and <i>Hiveswap</i> fans who are eager for a darker stroll across the Alternian landscape. <br><br>Future episodes will arrive regularly as DLC.",
