She and her group of heroic misfits journey through a desolate world that’s well past saving. Her quest to destroy the Faceless Overlord of the Mournfolk may be hopeless, but she's kinda into lost causes.<br><br>Bonfire is a procedurally generated, deeply tactical RPG with a rapid battle system and heroes that care a little too much. A game of plans that go sideways, crazy builds that somehow work, quick gameplay sessions, and a cute-sad story that binds it all together.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>RAPID TACTICS</strong></h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1163410/extras/33b6999eea768c08c17ba8e1741aac93.poster.avif?t=1603985856\" width=600 height=220 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1163410/extras/33b6999eea768c08c17ba8e1741aac93.webm?t=1603985856\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1163410/extras/33b6999eea768c08c17ba8e1741aac93.mp4?t=1603985856\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Bonfire is all about complex strategy emerging from simple rules. The rapid turn-based battle system drops menu navigation in favor of contextual abilities and tactical item use. Each click is a move, each move is significant, and each encounter is a puzzle to solve.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>JOURNEY</strong></h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1163410/extras/e569bae58e48f2d21e894228608ab860.poster.avif?t=1603985856\" width=600 height=220 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1163410/extras/e569bae58e48f2d21e894228608ab860.webm?t=1603985856\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1163410/extras/e569bae58e48f2d21e894228608ab860.mp4?t=1603985856\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>The gloomy world of Bonfire is procedurally generated. You'll travel to really depressing-sounding places, expand your arsenal of tactical options, meet a cast of rather odd survivors, and struggle to survive yourself. The game is designed for endless play, but its story actually goes somewhere. And yes -- there's even an ending.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>EXPERIMENTATION</strong></h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1163410/extras/68d97ce54e9ca7a2ab01edb67a4974d2.poster.avif?t=1603985856\" width=600 height=220 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1163410/extras/68d97ce54e9ca7a2ab01edb67a4974d2.webm?t=1603985856\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1163410/extras/68d97ce54e9ca7a2ab01edb67a4974d2.mp4?t=1603985856\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Making your own builds and party comps is where it's at! Bonfire classes are designed around subtle synergies to work in any possible combination. As your pool of available heroes, abilities and items increases, you'll be able to experiment with more and more interesting setups that don't fall under common RPG archetypes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>FAILURE</strong></h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1163410/extras/585133e712b2d810037fbeb15e86d93f.poster.avif?t=1603985856\" width=600 height=220 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1163410/extras/585133e712b2d810037fbeb15e86d93f.webm?t=1603985856\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1163410/extras/585133e712b2d810037fbeb15e86d93f.mp4?t=1603985856\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Bonfire is difficult. The challenge, however, doesn't come from spiteful RNG coin tosses. While you often have to make the best of a situation, success depends on your setup and tactical flexibility. Each decision is final, and each mistake may be fatal, but runs are bite-sized enough to allow for quick adjustments.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>SHOWERS OF BLOOD &amp; COINS</strong></h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1163410/extras/4fcb0405ed1fa98739da3d3054758d64.poster.avif?t=1603985856\" width=600 height=220 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1163410/extras/4fcb0405ed1fa98739da3d3054758d64.webm?t=1603985856\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1163410/extras/4fcb0405ed1fa98739da3d3054758d64.mp4?t=1603985856\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>This honestly should be at the top of this list.",
