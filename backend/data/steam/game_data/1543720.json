Inside that cathedral resides the last remnants of humanity, where humans live under vampire rule. Monsters scour for blood in every corner of the cathedral, and with the onset of giant monsters called goliaths, humanity's hope for survival has completely dissipated.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >However, while the future looks bleak, perhaps humanity can accomplish something grand in its final days before extinction. Play as a young woman named Aeryn, a talented monster killer from the Human Quarters, who may be able to do something extraordinary for a dying world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1543720/extras/b16c0293fb4963d1ecf5cb7a5ab1feb1.avif?t=1733068655\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1543720/extras_big/b16c0293fb4963d1ecf5cb7a5ab1feb1.avif?t=1733068655 width=800 height=100 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Inspired by <i>Bloodborne</i>, the <i>Dark Souls</i> trilogy and the <i>Castlevania</i> series, <i>Sunrise Tragedy</i> offers a new take on the 2D soulslike genre.

You are encouraged to learn how to pressure your enemies, which will make it easier to inflict stagger. Once they stagger, you will have a brief moment to inflict some major damage. However, this is not the only way to play. In this game, there is a large emphasis on build customization, giving you the freedom to form your own playstyle with a large catalogue of weapons, spells and accessories.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1543720/extras/6b6f1f27141400138bb66fee509c89e5.avif?t=1733068655\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1543720/extras_big/6b6f1f27141400138bb66fee509c89e5.avif?t=1733068655 width=800 height=100 /></span></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > This game offers a new rendition of the traditional &quot;estus flask&quot; healing mechanic of the soulslike genre with its elaborate alchemy system. Throughout your journey, you will collect many ingredients which you can put in your potions to give them new effects. For example, a magic build may want to include some MP-restoring ingredients, or in some areas you may want to include a cure for poison. Ingredients are reusable and permanently in your inventory once obtained, so you are free to experiment as much as you like.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1543720/extras/48afe5b99d5041c324501bb3a336f2de.avif?t=1733068655\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1543720/extras_big/48afe5b99d5041c324501bb3a336f2de.avif?t=1733068655 width=800 height=100 /></span></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >On your journey, you will encounter many whimsical characters.
