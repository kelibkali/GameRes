    "description": "Command Z is an exhibition realized by Michael Ziga; an experience viewed from the perspective of our successors, reflecting back on humanity from a distant future, as we now observe our predecessors. These works imagine the development of our devices and their effects on the evolution of humanity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVirtual sculptures in the galleries, produced using 3D scanning and digital sculpting techniques, are backed by images generated during the scanning process. 3D soundscapes - composed by Palmer Foote, Jimmy Quinn, Connor Hanwick, Olivia Harris, and Peter Toh - complement the installations, propelling the viewer through the virtual spaces.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Teleport into the black door to advance between levels !!! *",
