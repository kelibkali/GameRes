Not the dead, just a one Englebert Picklebender who has been in an ethereal entanglement with Oliver for many years. Together they run The Phantom Fellows, a paranormal investigation service that provides the breathers that hire them peace from hauntings, while bringing closure and rest to the floaters who torment the living, and often, themselves.<br><br>Take control of Oliver and Englebert in this point and click adventure comedy as you explore the town of Elderberry, Colorado and spend 7 days in the life of The Phantom Fellows. Share laughs with the living and the respiratorily challenged in a game where exploration is rewarded and there is more to the story than meets the eye.<br><br>Use Oliver's ability to... be alive, or switch to Englebert if the physical world is in the way. Negotiate with spirits, some of which seek closure, others a long lost possession and even some who just enjoy a good pranking- I mean, haunting.  Don't forget to also provide proof of service to the breather that hired you, they will need more than Oliver's word for it and seeing is believing! <br><br>Throughout your week with The Phantom Fellows you will meet many breathers, plenty of floaters and as you navigate through each day's task, something more malevolent begins lurking in the shadows, with it's eye on Oliver and an aim set on something bigger, something... otherworldly. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Narrative based adventure game where the writing and the story come first.<br></li><li> Hand-drawn pixel art and animations!<br></li><li> Walk or float around the environments, freely explore the world you're in.<br></li><li> Switch between Oliver and Englebert! Sometimes being dead has its perks. Maybe. Switching between the two unlocks in Day 2.<br></li><li> 7 Playable Days: Each day features it's own goals and characters, while an over-arcing story builds to an unavoidable confrontation!<br></li><li> Fast Travel Map: Unlocks in Day 3, freely explore the town of Elderberry, revisit the location of previous days for more interactions, world building and alternative puzzle solutions!<br></li><li> Real World Puzzle Reasoning: Some puzzles have alternate solutions based on simple reasoning- you never have to leave the location of the day, but if you saw something in a previous day's location that would help you in your current day, you can go get it and use it!<br></li><li> Dialog-based Hint System: Englebert often plays the role of mentor to Oliver. You can speak to him for advice on what to do, and he will give you hints with increasing levels of detail, along with the option to have him stop so you may take as much or as little help as you wish.<br></li><li> Hotspot Heaven: It's all clickable! Oliver and Englebert will look at and interact with everything and provide you with unique lines, laughter and world building, for doing so.<br></li><li> Dual Controls: Optimized for easy, keyboard based control, while maintaining the option to instead point and click.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1581490/extras/0fbaa9cdf82da232fab64869b062dfbf.poster.avif?t=1727460252\" width=376 height=180 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1581490/extras/0fbaa9cdf82da232fab64869b062dfbf.webm?t=1727460252\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1581490/extras/0fbaa9cdf82da232fab64869b062dfbf.mp4?t=1727460252\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
