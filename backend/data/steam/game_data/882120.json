    "description": "<strong> Rugon will not be completed. </strong><br><br>Rugon is published as unfinished in order to give the existing community that accompanied us on our journey and new players the opportunity to continue playing Rugon. As this does not happen often, we want to reiterate that Rugon is not monetized and <strong>ALL GAME CONTEN</strong>T is available for free.<br><br><br><br>Dive deep into the world of Rugon, a collectable card game, where strategic diversity is the number one priority. Combine creatures to strengthen them, build fortifications that give strategic abilities and raise your level to play even more powerful creatures! <br>Play as one of many factions with a distinct playstyle and unique abilities. Fight for honor, for tradition, for knowledge, or simply to survive. <br>Rise above your competition and become Rugon’s greatest Commander! <br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/882120/extras/d361c7a2433f17ae6c965260c9897296.webp?t=1612912960\" width=40 height=43 /></span><strong> Level up yourself</strong><br>You start the match at level one. The lower your life, the higher your level and the stronger the cards you can play. When you’re behind, you can play stronger cards than your enemy! Always keep an eye on that experience gauge.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/882120/extras/5b34e49b8e76a6833ad0f538b847abcc.webp?t=1612912960\" width=40 height=43 /></span><strong> Fights have grave consequences</strong><br>Creatures don’t have separate “attack” and “life” attributes, they have “stamina”. When two creatures battle, they lose stamina: both life and attack power! This will leave the survivor crippled, who will have a hard time fighting other creatures. Pick your battles wisely!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/882120/extras/88572f388d46fb072213028d161bf957.webp?t=1612912960\" width=40 height=43 /></span><strong> Creatures can support other creatures</strong><br>You can buff any creature on the field by combining it with one from your hand! With this, you can use your creatures in creative and unexpected ways. Explore all possible combinations to find the playstyle that suits you most!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/882120/extras/0f1294788c174960b492e066371a5bcd.webp?t=1612912960\" width=40 height=43 /></span><strong> Build Fortifications</strong><br>The Fortification is a new type of Card. It can be played anytime and gives you a permanent advantage! This may range from simple creature buffs to complicated, strategic benefits. Sadly, your enemy can destroy your fortifications, so pay attention! You don’t want to lose your advantage, do you?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/882120/extras/5cd549d4486ca3bd024f54dfa3c76e24.webp?t=1612912960\" width=40 height=43 /></span><strong> Factions, heroes, playstyles</strong><br>Each of the five factions comes with their own playstyle and set of heroes. Pick one hero and build your deck around their personal ability! But although you can have only one faction per deck, don’t worry - as long as you own a hero from that faction, you can play any faction anytime!",
