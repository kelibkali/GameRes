    "description": "Welcome to Puzzle Island, a beautiful place where time stands still and there's nowhere you need to go. It's just you, the sand, the palm trees and of course the lovely ocean.<br><br><i>But we wouldn't want you to get bored while you're here, so how about some puzzles to solve while the sun sets?</i><br><br>In each level of Puzzle Island VR you're given various objects such as crates, buckets, balls or planks. Equipped with some of the most realistic ropes you've ever seen in a game, you'll need to somehow stack those objects to touch the glowing orb. Sounds easy, right? Well it isn't always. Sometimes the wind will blow your boxes away or the force-field prevents you putting that create exactly where you need it and often the solution is more challenging than simply stacking objects.<br><br>The puzzles will require you to think like an engineer, keep cool like a martial arts grand-master, have a steady hand like a marksman and also think outside of the box like an inventor.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Beautiful and realistic island</strong>: Perfect for presenting the capabilities of VR<br></li><li><strong>Super cool rope physics</strong>: Swing them and fling them, pretty amazing<br></li><li><strong>Family friendly</strong>: Show your kids the beach<br></li><li><strong>No time limits</strong>: Relax, become one with Puzzle Island and take as long as you need to solve the puzzles.<br></li><li><strong>Soundtrack</strong>: Atmospheric music will make you feel one with the ocean</li></ul>",
