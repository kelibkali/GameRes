A cart stands at a crossroads, out of place in all respects, but you ain't one to complain on an empty stomach. You stumble up to its window, desperate for something to ease your pain...<br><br>Cures &amp; Curios is a virtual reality game for the HTC Vive set in the Weird Old West. In this mystical take on the American frontier, the player toils in an old-fashioned medicine show cart in the center of a small pioneer town called Pueblo Pequeño. Each day, you must concoct a variety of potions for the locals that come to your window. As your potion-making skills grow, so do your options: new recipes, ingredients, tools, and rewards await you. But know that the fruits of your labor belong to the Beast, the mysterious figure that brought you back from the edge of death only to force you into servitude.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1141740/extras/a40fc13b180859695c853dd6bb194d1f.avif?t=1670243189\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Intuitive controls and mechanics!<br></li><li>A variety of ingredients to incorporate into your recipes!<br></li><li>A lived-in cart with secrets to discover!<br></li><li>A town full of folks eager to imbibe your tonics and elixirs!<br></li><li>An ancient, terrible creature for a boss that forces you to work without end!</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1141740/extras/a0314dc9cb71f37107ea1d9189626940.avif?t=1670243189\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><br>This game was developed as a student project at DigiPen Institute of Technology and was created for educational purposes only.
