This goal was almost reached: collapsing German Army was not capable to offer resistance, while local armies were not prepared for the war yet.<br><br>The next stage started when German Army managed to build defences in front of Germany's borders. New regular units and freikorps were sent to Latvia, help was offered to organize local armies. The Red Army was pushed away to the east.<br><br>The same Germans who just had driven bolshewiks away now started to act, lead by imperialist goals. Estonia and Latvia had to fight for their independence. The most important battle for Estonian War of Independence took place in Latvia, near Cēsis.<br><br>After Latvian Army had organized in liberated part of Latvia, it inherited not only the front against the Red Army, but a new front, that had formed in the west in form of West-Russian Army. This army with its allies tried to wipe out Latvia. Latvian Army finally had to free Latvia from foreign armies in the west.<br><br>Ultimately Latvian Army could turn to its main enemy - the Red Army that still occupied large part of Latvia. This operation in the beginning of 1920 was executed together with the Polish Army.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1646380/extras/12d16d7eb23b5d1a94f46415a7700408.avif?t=1725034748\" width=625 height=193 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Game features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Lesser known setting near the Baltic Sea<br></li><li>Well researched historical battlefields<br></li><li>Campaigns of half-dozen different fighting forces<br></li><li>Unique card-based combat mechanics<br></li><li>Paper map and hand-painted miniature aestetic</li></ul>",
