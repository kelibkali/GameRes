    "description": "What is in the &quot;Way of Gold and Steel&quot; which makes it interesting?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMain reason is the unusual gameplay style — combination of a real-time strategy (RTS) and a roguelike. As you know, in a typical RTS you issue global orders — basically what should be built and how to advance through the technology trees. It is different here. You control your character like you normally would do in a roguelike. Also you issue orders to your followers verbally, participate in fights, you have inventory and equipment. As a result we've got a mix of genres: real-time strategy and a dungeon crawler, two in one.",
