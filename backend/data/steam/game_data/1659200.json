Start with point-and-click controls where you hack cloud-connected devices to escape puzzle rooms from an omniscient top down isometric perspective. Progress to WASD-style controls as you get your hands dirty solving more complex puzzles and clearing obstacles. Discover your origins and collect secrets as you progress through this satirical, chaos-filled adventure and learn deep secrets of the universe like why flamethrowers are indeed dangerous.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Delight in Omniscience</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1659200/extras/4033d8be5ff8f4ff2517dea356048747.poster.avif?t=1734461037\" width=608 height=152 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1659200/extras/4033d8be5ff8f4ff2517dea356048747.webm?t=1734461037\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1659200/extras/4033d8be5ff8f4ff2517dea356048747.mp4?t=1734461037\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>As an awakened computer program use the information superhighway to interact with electronic devices to steer your charge clear of danger.
