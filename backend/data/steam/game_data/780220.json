Rather you have to be aware of how you fly and how to target or drop your arsenal onto the enemies. the enemies are a bit more intelligent than just to be a placeholder. they are part of the environment and they blend together with the gameplay. the enemies will try to dodge your weapons and are more likely to engage with the progression of the player.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/780220/extras/bdc5d59404e81cd203b9f3a1b84bb359.avif?t=1584295475\" width=680 height=244 /></span><br>This is about a boy genius who goes to deal with the parasitic gump. Here he  roams around in his, buggy plane that he has invented and goes on to take on the challenge. The Gump however has their own technology from the prayers of the ancients. As they dwell with each other you journey through the stages and discover doobies fate. Some says they just want him to feel destroyed.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/780220/extras/aac1d4b3b1fbcc2f0ca0b6880de62fba.avif?t=1584295475\" width=600 height=132 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Characters</strong></h2>The characters and the elements of this game are hand drawn vectors. And you would find they are not perpetually generated. It's been carefully designed so it does not repeat it self. the enemies are called quibble, who live in different part of Gump. being the habitant of gump they are all a bit more family oriented. And As you go through the process from level to level you can unlock more quibbles  and learn more about who they are.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Player Choices</strong></h2>The Gameplay features of this game are that you can choose moody weapons  and doobies state of being himself. The Player selection Choice will reflect how you stature against your enemies. you can buy Custom guns, you can buy PowerCharger to slash through with your all upgraded weapons.  the Arcade style gameplay is a bit moderated with the way it is played in reference to its player choices.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Co-op</strong></h2>this is a single+ Co-op game. it only adds more weapon power when going on taking the challenge but its been balanced so you would still find the levels quite challenging yet enjoying the fire power. usually quibbles come in groups of paranoia in a simple little obsession, cloning yourself only helps it better. may be its for the better good of the adventure.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Doobies Lab</strong></h2>Doobie has his own lab and here you can experiment with different combinations of chemicals and discover different elements that will unlock upgrades. there are many upgrades and it has a direct effect on how you play the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Gunshop.</strong></h2>the gunshop has plenty of options for you to choose from. they are not the usual futuristic guns where you can go mad shooting the enemies, but a bit of realism and going with the game theme is a bit different. you can buy the guns with your score point, as there is no in-game payment to be made. the guns have special upgrades such as mechanical flight suit called powerChargers. the power chargers are powerful weapons invented and developed in doobies lab to help him fly through the land of Gump.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>GameMaker</strong></h2>the game maker is a custom game maker tool inside the game. it is part fo the game as well, practice makes things better. you can choose whichever quibbles you unlock playing the solo campaign game. once unlocked you can go ahead and shoot it off back again and. You can raise your score by playing more and more on the custom stage and use it to buy guns and upgrade in the Gunshop, perhaps use it in the campaign game as well. you can choose which environment you want to play in and go on play your custom game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>LinearProgression</strong></h2>The Levels are set to fly linear paths but it has been carefully designed so it has a vertical freedom to it. the length of the game depends on how you play the game. if you engage with the enemies and huddle your way through the obstacles the game play becomes much more enjoyable rather than flying really high, which will not effect the enemies or the level elements.<br><br>This is supposed to be a fun game, with light humour and seriousness for the <strong>Arcade</strong> lovers. For Technical issues report in the Community Hub.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Controller Support</strong></h2>Xbox Controller support has been added. although it's not been tested.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Window shopper</strong></h2>if you are not satisfied with the game  or other things please leave a comment on the discussion forum, how it could have been better, what were you expecting, and what gameplay feature you wanted to have..or other things. Same goes with the wishlist additions. the game will not be updated to a new game. it is what it is and you may make your choice based on what is presented.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/780220/extras/1a5d4c51fbe9794fb1b32060fac4a7ba.poster.avif?t=1584295475\" width=600 height=180 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/780220/extras/1a5d4c51fbe9794fb1b32060fac4a7ba.webm?t=1584295475\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/780220/extras/1a5d4c51fbe9794fb1b32060fac4a7ba.mp4?t=1584295475\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
