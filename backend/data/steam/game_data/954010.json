Use Steam's <i>Remote Play</i> feature to play with other Steam users with just one copy of the game!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Action-Stealth gameplay</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Approach missions in different ways depending on your loadout and strategy. Take out enemies before they notice you with close-ranged melee and silenced weapons! Or run in with a shotgun and some grenades. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Slow-mo</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Slow-motion effects activate throughout the game. Use them to your advantage to dodge bullets or get a second to make a decision!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Party mode</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Play local co-op versus with 2-4 players. Go free-for-all or split into teams! </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Zombie mode</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Survive never-ending waves of zombies, purchase upgrades with kills, and explore the larger maps! </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Mission editor with Steam Workshop integration</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >With the built-in editor, create all the missions you can see in the Missions mode and more!
