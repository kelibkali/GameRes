    "description": "<strong>Prismatic Maze is my ongoing attempt to make an interesting maze game.</strong><br><br>In Prismatic Maze, maps are not pre-built or purely random, they are grown.<br><br>Maps are seeded with Pigment creatures which grow larger over time like bacteria in a petri dish, filling their inside area with maze walls.<br><br>Pigments bump up against each other, punch doors through to the other side and hide keys inside the bodies of their neighbors.<br><br><strong>Classic Mode</strong><br>In Classic Mode, you play as an agent of White and are tasked with bringing light to the Black Tower, which is hidden and locked away somewhere on the same map.<br><br>You must find keys to unlock the doors barring your way, break into the domains of your neighbors, exploring to steal their seeds to unlock the Black Tower.<br><br>Along the way, you can find items to assist you in your exploration as well as ingredients to build new maps with large and more complex mazes.",
