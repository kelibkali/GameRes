    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story</h2>Nikolai, the son of two soviet engineers and a normal Japanese student, has no idea his world will soon be turned over. The familiar and dear will clash with the grim ghosts of the past in his soul. Now Nikolai will have to decide whom can he really trust and find out why those with power and money have taken an interest in him, the lives of average people insignificant to them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Heroines</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/617070/extras/d9729578f8626f68851cf6a212872ab8.avif?t=1491516603\" width=600 height=126 /></span><br>Himitsu is Nikolai’s childhood friend. She is kind, caring, she always worries for him, sometimes even too annoyingly so. But is simple friendship really enough for her? Perhaps, the years of devotion earned her something more?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/617070/extras/eddde0ec33b2fa8de8c6df7994ca3203.avif?t=1491516603\" width=600 height=126 /></span><br>Catherine is Nikolai’s ex-girlfriend who left Japan about a year before the beginning of the game’s events. Their parting wasn’t the prettiest, and Nikolai still carries quite uncomfortable memories about it. Perhaps he would have forgotten them with time, but Catherine suddenly returns and, moreover, transfers into his class. Why did she return? Does she still love him? Does he still love her?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/617070/extras/91a01ed1376d198360a3cdc38c844b00.avif?t=1491516603\" width=600 height=126 /></span><br>Ellie is the granddaughter of the board chairman of the school Nikolai goes to. She is a self-willed, proud girl and thinks highly of herself, but cannot be said to lack ardour. Is everything really as simple as it looks at the first glance, or is there more than meets the eye behind the image of a spoiled young lady?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/617070/extras/7d5f3b365635434ef53cd9bd72869c39.avif?t=1491516603\" width=600 height=126 /></span><br>Kagome is the representative of Nikolai’s class. He has never paid attention to her before, but a certain sequence of events makes them come to know each other. Kagome isn’t loved in the school, and she isn’t really burning with desire to become friends with anyone either. Is there a reason for her behaviour? What hides behind the facade of a simple unsociable girl? What secrets does she hide?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Main features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Four heroines, each with her own story and several possible endings<br></li><li>Over 100 backgrounds and over 100 event CGs<br></li><li>3,5+ hours of music<br></li><li>Unity3D as the game engine<br></li><li>Over 300 000 words in the script<br></li><li>Fully animated background and character sprites<br></li><li>Multiplatform (including web- and mobile versions)<ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul></li></ul>",
