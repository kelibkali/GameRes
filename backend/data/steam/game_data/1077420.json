However, you can opt to play in <strong>Amputee Mode</strong>, which lets you progress through the game with just one hand. Perfect if you're missing a hand, sipping a beer, or holding a baby.<br><br>IMPORTANT: This game uses a special control scheme that requires an Xbox-style (X-input) gamepad with two joysticks. It cannot be played with a keyboard and mouse.",
