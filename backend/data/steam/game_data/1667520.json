    "description": "A BYTE-SIZED ROGUELIKE ANTI-SHOOT-EM-UP<br><br>You are a data-integrity program inside of a computer and your job is to prevent other programs from having their data corrupted!<br><br>“Enemy” programs emit electron projectiles and your job is to deflect them to “ground” and not accidentally damage the programs themselves in the process. Features 3 worlds of crazy bullet-heck action with semi-randomized room order and an upgrade system that provides a bevy of interesting ways to progress!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The story behind Save Data</h2>Save Data is part of what has retroactively been termed a &quot;molasses jam&quot; run by the <strong>Bay Area Dev Collective</strong>. The theme of the jam was to <i>make a violent genre non-violent</i>. As I've had a growing interest in action games, specifically of the shoot-em-up variety, naturally I wondered what it would be like to make such a game non-violent. The result is shoot-em-up where you have to protect the &quot;enemies&quot;!<br><br>The other molasses game jam games are also on steam:<br><br><br>",
