    "description": "Hazelnut Bastille is a topdown, Zelda-like ARPG, crafted in a 16bit character; it features action-adventure style gameplay. Players will engage with heavily tactical, real-time combat, and experience taxing lateral-thinking puzzles! Explore a vast Overworld which is brimming with content, in the form of secrets, collectibles, mini-games, and story elements! A set of unforgiving Dungeons forms the core experience, as the player obtains a series of items which grants them ever greater control over the world, as well as new powers of traversal, in true Metroidvania fashion!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers take on the role of a cast-out heroine, setting foot on the shores of a new continent, in the hopes of regaining something which was lost to her! Her fate will be inexplicably intertwined with the sundry crew already living there, as she gets drawn into a baroque plot to unravel the mysteries of this land's original inhabitants!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers can expect a roughly 2-3 hour experience from the Demo!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHazelnut Bastille is coming to Windows, Mac, and Linux Platforms on Steam, sometime in 2020!",
