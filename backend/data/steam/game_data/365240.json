    "description": "Economic based 4x, puts you in a large galaxy with hundreds of systems as a CEO of a colony destined to rule over all competitors, features dozens or more opponent CEOs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContaining some features never seen in 4x games. Galaxy Union places you in a densely populated galaxy as a CEO of a corporation with a mission to unite the galaxy under your rule. Colonize systems, build colonies, research stations, become rich and commission fleets that will conquer the galaxy. This is a turn based 4x game, includes a global market with fluctuating prices, real life minerals, gases and a periodic table. It departs from the regular notion of only having a handful of opponent players and puts you in a galaxy where dozens and sometime up to a hundred AI players are competing with you.",
