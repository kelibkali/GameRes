    "description": "Ultimate Zombie Death Ball is a 1v1 arena sports game set in a zombie apocalypse. The object of the game is to get a ball in your opponent’s net, while being chased by a hoard of hungry zombies. Also, the ball is electrified, and will stun you if you kick it. <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2085450/extras/1c5d22838af0dea9d5808e3a9d15ea97.avif?t=1659016648\" width=179 height=250 /></span><br><br>Luckily, the zombies can kick the ball for you.
