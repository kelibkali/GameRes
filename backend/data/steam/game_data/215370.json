    "description": "A letter arrived today. The envelope was thick with the smell of a woman's perfume. It was an invitation, but not the invitation I expected. It was a call to take part in the &quot;Greatest con of all time.&quot; Intrigued, I followed the message to one of the wealthiest parts of Atlantic City. The place was full of rich little good-for-nothings who never had to work for a living - the perfect setting for a scam.<br><br>New Jersey, February 1919. A young woman claiming to be Anastasia Romanov disappears after raising a considerable sum of money from local Russian immigrants who supported the royalist regime in Russia. The police suspected a con scheme but the very people that gave the money truly believed that the self-proclaimed Romanov has gone into hiding because of Soviet spies threatening her life.<br><br>The person in question was Anna Anderson. She is known to be a charismatic and influential socialite with striking good looks. Her personality baffles investigators and people acquainted with the case and on one could tell whether this was a brilliant con act or the naked truth.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Availability:</h2><br>This DLC is available after successfully completing the first two missions of the single player campaign.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>New Henchman: Anna Anderson<br></li><li>New Weapon: The Mohaska<br></li><li>New District: Connecticut Ave</li></ul>",
