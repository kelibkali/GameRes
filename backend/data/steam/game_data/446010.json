    "description": "<strong>Welcome to CitiesCorp Concept!</strong><br><br>Inspired by all the cool city building simulations, CitiesCorp Concept is an indie-game for all the passionate majors that love to see new ideas and visions turn into reality. <br><br>CitiesCorp Concept proudly represents the meaning of what can be different in a city building simulation – scale and shape your buildings, decide the textures, set own production lines or even decide which traffic signs have to be deployed – in other words, do what you probably have missed in other city building games for many years. <br><br>CitiesCorp Concept is just the beginning – Your interest &amp; support will help to push innovation in the city simulation genre to its edges, because I love to build cities as well. <br><br><strong>Before starting to play/buying it, don't forget to check the tutorials on Youtube/SaintWorks-Channel</strong> - the game has no ingame hints or tutorials!!!<br><br><strong>Why &quot;Concept&quot; Game?</strong><br><br><strong>The main idea behind this &quot;Concept&quot; is to have a flexible platform in place that will support further development</strong> which will depend on the interest of players, inspiration and of course my ability to afford it (but hey, even in worst case, hobby mode is still available :-).<br><br>Even the game contains plenty of innovative ideas, I believe that there are a lot of interesting features that could be implemented within a feasible time and could be made available to everybody. <strong>However, the project's target is not to replicate functions from other games</strong>, but coming up with own ideas. That's also why some well known functions have not been implemented - I simply did not have a better idea how to make it differently :-).<br><br>It's not Early Access, because, with some minor exceptions related to fine tuning and bugs, the game is already fully playable as it is.<br><br>Please check also the game requirements - optimization of the game was not the top priority (with that, I would have to sacrifice some features).<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Storyline</strong><br><br>CitiesCorp means that a corporation is taking over the responsibility – so in fact, there are no majors, just CEOs. Your corporation takes care about housing, jobs, products and its own profits. In return, there are no taxes – neither to the corporation nor to the population. <br><br><br><strong>What Is In? What Can Be Played Today?</strong><br><br>- Map That Is Equivalent to 10km X 10km,<br>- Scale Buildings,<br>- Shape Buildings,<br>- Numerous In-game Building Textures,<br>- Creating building complexes through a simple and effective overlapping system, <br>- Multiple building functionalities (e.g. appartments, offices, shops, factories in one building), <br>- Challenging economy with hundreds of products to be produced and sold, <br>- Flexible street building system, <br>- Street signs and lightning for coping with traffic jams. <br><br><br><br><strong>What Is Not In (yet)?</strong><br><br>- Mainly things that can be already played in other similar games - in case there will be a great idea to do it &quot;differently&quot;, it will be implemented<br><br>    - Public buildings, e.g. police, schools, hospitals etc. <br>    - Landscapes - at the moment it is just a flat land, <br>    - Public transport, e.g. trains, busses etc., <br>    - Curvy roads, <br>    - Tax system – and do not even ask for it.",
