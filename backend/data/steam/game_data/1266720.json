    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Squirrel Forest</h2>If you were asked how you imagine an apocalypse you would probably mention zombies or a nuclear winter. This is not what happened to the squirrels, however. Deforestation is enough. Their habitats were destroyed. Food sources diminished. All hope is lost... Unless, you step in and help to guide two squirrel brothers Zen and Ven on this quest to restore the harmony in the forest.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Important!</h2>The game is currently undergoing a design overhaul and is in early development stages. Please be patient!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Short Term Goal</h2>Survive, gather resources and save fellow squirrels. They will join you and help you to restore the forest.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Long term goal</h2>Re-plant the whole forest and ensure the survival of the species.",
