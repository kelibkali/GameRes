This provides a unique twist on the familiar game genre, battle royale. When a new match starts, each contestant has a bounty on their head. Outfitting yourself with advanced technology, you must hunt other players and eliminate them to collect their bounties. With each foe you eliminate, your own bounty will increase, making you a more desirable target for everyone else!<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/861530/extras/a57bd821f1626663c0a86e8ab1e4bb6e.avif?t=1736851587\" width=600 height=296 /></span><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Custom-Built Your Way </h2></strong><br>Customize your anthropomorphic robot, a.k.a.
