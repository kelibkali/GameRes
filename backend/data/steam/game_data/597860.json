We’ve ended up making a game we have loved to play. We’re an Indie team of just 2 people: Mr. Garcai and Víctor Ávila. All graphical assets are credited to Mr. Garcai - illustration, design, scenarios, etc. He’s the creative mind in the team. Víctor takes the programming, development, animation integration…and puts all of Garcai creations to work!",
