    "description": "Grave of the Petrified is a single-player VR game. Set in an ancient Greek temple where Medusa has been sneaking around for centuries, petrifying whoever crosses her path, the player will go through a spine-tingling escape experience. Surrounded by statues of prior adventurers and fighters who have been turned into stone throughout history one must find the keys for the door to get out. But avoid Medusa’s gaze at all cost – otherwise you will also become a part of the graveyard.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game was completed within 10 weeks, the platforms used are PC and HTC Vive. Eerily realistic statues and some environment assets are achieved by using photogrammetry.",
