    "description": "<strong>'Pay2Win: The Tricks Exposed'</strong> is a Pay2Win business model simulator(adventure) that exposes the tricks online game businessmen use to maximize monetization. This game also gives you a chance to think about the value of paying money to Pay2Win games. <br>In this game, you become a warrior in a fantasy world, experience the Pay2Win business model and uncover the hidden secrets behind the systems.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Before you play this game:</h2>-The Pay2Win model is not necessarily evil. But you must know on what you spent your money. Now you can, with this game. <br><br><br>-We recommend this game to those who have read Thomas Baekdal's 'How In-app Purchases Have Destroyed The Industry' and were excited by it. <br><br>-In this game, you will have to purchase countless transactions just to play. But worry not. The cash in this game is free and virtual, and is provided limitlessly. <strong>(NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE!!)</strong><br><br>-However, the accumulated cash amount you've spent will be shown in the game screen, and this will bother you a bit.<br><br>-This game cannot represent all the pay2win tricks that exist in the world. Even now, new tricks are being conjured.<br><br>-This game simulates an MMORPG, but only supports single play mode. NPCs who pose as other players appear in this game.<br><br>-The 'Avatar' you meet in the game is an extension of the game's creator. Talk to him. He is dead serious.<br><br>Best Gaem Studio <br>&quot;We create gaem&quot;",
