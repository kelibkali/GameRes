Following his dream of pursuing a cause dear to him, Mizukami Sei heads to his new place of enrollment; but from the beginning, everything seems off to him.  His curiosity getting the best of him, he continues to explore the school, but brushes off the rumors and stories of &quot;mysterious&quot; happenings as mere hearsay. Gathering an unlikely group of friends and slowly exploring and learning more about the school and its history, the legends surrounding the school begin to seem increasingly suspicious.  Accompanied by the stern student council vice president and sweet librarian of the school, Sei, emboldened by his personal pursuits, and his roommate Yuuto together delve deeper into the dark mysteries of the St Clementine - even if consequences may lay ahead.<br><br>Will they be able to solve the mysteries of St Clementine, and more importantly, will they survive? Can they trust each other? And what exactly are the dark secrets this school hides?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117470/extras/3580fca3124e0fa31b55778242431ddf.avif?t=1669812501\" width=506 height=716 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117470/extras/1c2d272cf502c81a70a30b684c2d303d.avif?t=1669812501\" width=566 height=148 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Easy on the eyes. the characters are drawn in painting style that matches overall dark tone of the game.<br></li><li>Pulchritudinous Death.
