    "description": "Venture into a forbidden cursed city in the hopes of rescuing your sister! It's set up in a rogue-like manner, where you enter the forbidden city of Atlantris,<br />\r\nand if you are nearing death, you get teleported out by your sorcerer friend. You get to keep all of your experience and items, but have to start from<br />\r\nthe beginning every time you die! There are more than fifteen 'levels' and the player can expect to beat the game in around 3 hours if they're good. The battles <br />\r\nare turn based and feature a neat sliding bar that you have to press at the right time to execute attacks. Beyond that there are random item drops from the<br />\r\nenemies, and many skills to be learned. There's also a hidden character.",
