    "description": "You run at high speed and attack enemies.<br />\r\nThe main point is to enjoy feeling of speed and your own dexterity. For me, just running forward is a pleasure itself.<br />\r\nMoreover there's a gameplay which requires accuracy of your movements.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI am a big fan of the old 90s games, and I tried to reproduce the graphic style of some games of that era. In general, I tried to make levels in the spirit of the first Quake, and to achieve the same feeling of a shotgun. Although this is not the main weapon in my game.<br />\r\nIn summing up, you may enjoy the game if you like fast running, feeling of speed and the action games in general.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* A hard to master game with unusual gameplay.<br />\r\n* Fast-paced, it requires good reflexes and dexterity.<br />\r\n* Short, it only takes an hour or two to beat.<br />\r\n* Software-rendered retro style graphics from the '90s.",
