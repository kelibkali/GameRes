    "description": "Zahhak is a side-scrolling platform-shooter. Sargent Kickass is a hard-as-nails cop who is tasked to gun down an entire army of lunatics, the Zahhak Trinity, a sect that is trying to summon their dark prophecies. Deactivate their bombs and rescue their hostages, in an arcade style gameplay.<br />\r\nThe game is a gun-blazing action, with stages situated in the city, where the terrorists are placing explosives; the forest, where the sect is taking hold of hostages; and at the factory, where the high priest is located. There are bonus stages to recover the health and gain ammo, and upgrade to a better weapon.",
