MIDI devices (such as electronic drum pedals) can be integrated into Paradiddle to trigger any drums within the environment. Likewise, Paradiddle can also send MIDI output, which means you can use the app to trigger your own samples in your favorite digital audio workstation. This transforms Paradiddle into an extremely powerful audio creation tool.<br></li><li><strong>Peripheral support</strong> for kick and hi-hat. Any USB peripheral that can emulate keyboard input (such as USB pedals) can be used in Paradiddle as a way to trigger the kick drum or control the hi-hat.<br></li><li><strong>ASIO Support.</strong> Audio enthusiasts that want maximum customization of their audio settings can switch their output device to ASIO. By default, the app uses WASAPI, and a lot of time was spent to ensure that the latency was kept to a minimum with the default settings.<br></li><li>Customise settings like pitch and max volume for each individual drum. These settings will expand in the future to give users greater control over the sound that comes out of their drums.</li></ul>",
