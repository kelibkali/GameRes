    "description": "Captain Shika has seen all kinds of things in her adventures throughout the universe, and with her two loyal crew members by her side, she's managed to make a name for her small company of mercenaries. When Shika finds a bounty job offering an absurd amount of money, she doesn't hesitate to act: tracking hardened criminals is part of the job. Their target is an elusive mastermind, a mark who challenges their ingenuity at every turn. In this yuri space adventure, the crew will need all of their wits - and a fair amount of luck - to bring their quarry to justice.",
