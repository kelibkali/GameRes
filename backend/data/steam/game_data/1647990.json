    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >UPDATE 2025-10-19</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This game was made with Unity, which has an RCE exploit designated CVE-2025-59489.  This exploit allows an attacker to run arbitrary code by invoking the Ningakki XXVI FPS executable.  I have updated the game to mitigate this vulnerability, but Steam/Valve will not allow me to upload the patched files (as per &quot;Jason&quot; with Steamworks Support).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >From my Steam Analytics, I think only nine people have played this game over the last year, so I think the exposure surface is quite minimal.  If Steam/Valve ever fix their systems to allow updates, then I will upload the fixed versions that are not vulnerable.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >=============================================================</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >In this game you kill robots to save yourself.  Or just escape and hope someone else deals</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >with the problem.  Or self-sacrifice yourself to blow up the planet.  Or</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >let the robots kill you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The game play is slow, and decidedly unhelpful.  Modern games guide you</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >incessantly towards the objectives.  This game doesn't.  There is no</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >handy weapon to start with, you have to punch the door open with your</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >bare fists and then find a weapon.  There are no hints as to where to</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >find a weapon.  The first weapon you pickup chooses if you are a wizard</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >or a mundane.  There are three wizard weapons, and six mundane weapons.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >I wrote this game as a project to learn Unity.  Getting it onto Steam</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >was also a goal.  The core of the game is the Unity FPS Microgame, but</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >I'd like to think that I added and changed enough things to elevate this</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >above an asset-flip.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >I didn't implement everything I wanted to, but I learned a lot along the</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >way.  My accomplishments are: a surveilance drone, landmines, barbed</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >wire, updated graphics (especially the jetpack model and the sniper</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >rifle model), a healing platform, a pick-up for the compass, a pick-up</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >for the flashlight, a pick-up to expand your jetpack fuel (the Unity FPS</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Microgame provided the jetpack pickup), tweaked AI aiming, several new</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >AI aggro distributions, the wizard/mundane paradigm, and more I'm sure.</p>",
