Need a water source? Place a water drop tile into a canyon and watch the surrounding flat land become fertile. Need suitable terrain to build wind turbines? Use a terraforming kit to raise mountains that will help increase your energy production. <br><br>Terraforming tiles have preset shapes, so be careful when configuring where to place them! You may end up with ice if you place a water drop tile on flat ground instead of a canyon.
