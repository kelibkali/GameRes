    "description": "War of Velana is a single player 16-bit RPG that combines world exploration and interaction with an orthographic grid-based tactical battle system. In many ways, War of Velana is in many ways a spiritual successor to the Shining Force series on the Sega Genesis. Elements of those games are the core, and combine with some design ideas from Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics to create a new tactical experience. In War of Velana, your characters have static classes and gain a variety of skills and equipment upgrades as you progress through the game. In between combat, you’ll be able to explore and interact with the world around you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis demo covers the first chapter of the game and is about 90% content complete. There will be additional bug fixes, side content, and other improvements added as we have them ready. If you play the demo, we'd love to know your thoughts or any issues you encountered along the way!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSetting:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe world of Velana, in its current state, has four nations:<br />\r\nAlta, a royal kingdom of sprawling green fields, meadows, and riverlands.<br />\r\nKovell, a nation with a wide plain of autumn-gold, a dark forest, and a northern tundra.<br />\r\nIshdar, a small desert island nation of artisans and warriors to the far east.<br />\r\nJakka, a jungle archipelago with towering mountains and devout monasteries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur story starts in Alta near the foothills of the Goravia Ridge, outside the small village of Pell.

They help him repair his cart, but quickly realize that bandits have taken over their home. Events continue to unfold, the party bears witness to a mysterious encounter and potential sparks of a new war.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCharacters:<br />\r\nArnen, a hunter from Pell Village.

Each unit moves in Turn Order, rather than Player-vs-Enemy phases.<br />\r\nUnit inventories can be managed in and out of combat. Equipping items and even trading them between units is possible and doesn’t count as a turn action.<br />\r\nEach class has different magic spells and weapon skills to learn. Though you may find two allies of the same class, each will have unique abilities and different stat growth ranges.<br />\r\nWhen a unit levels up, their HP, SP, and stats increase based on growth ranges for their class. Melee units will focus on Attack, Defense, or Speed growth whereas casters will focus on Magic and Resistance, in most cases.<br />\r\nThere are many allies, items, and secrets to uncover all over the country of Alta.
