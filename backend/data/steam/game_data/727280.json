    "description": "Before the tech apocalypse, the humans built a perfect city where robots did all the work. It did not take long for technology to turn against protocol and begin taking the lives of their human counterparts. Twenty years later, the robot uprising fell apart with no way to service the larger machines. Civilization became a trail of broken metal on desolate highways. There are very few humans left, and the only ones brave enough to traverse these barren wastelands are called Scrappers.<br><br>Shoot, kick, and detonate your way through a post tech apocalyptic wasteland where robots reign terror upon the resourceful Scrappers. Scrap foes, unlock weapons, play alone or with friends and take back the world.<br><br>Scrap is a free, 3D, action, twin stick, shooter that offers single player and local co-op experiences. Play as a Scrapper, fighting your way through a multitude of robot foes, utilizing tactical teamwork and makeshift weapons.<br><br>***Xbox 360 Controller Required****<br><br>Scrap contains:<br><strong>Four Action Packed Missions</strong><br>Travel through the winding desert wastes, through run down highways and train yards, to a robot graveyard.
