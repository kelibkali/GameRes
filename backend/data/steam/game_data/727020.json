You will encounter many more dynamic obstacles such as gravity wells, space worms, falling stalactites and more! There are also several paths through the level allowing players of all skill levels a rewarding experience. By discovering Fuel Tanks, it is also possible to complete all paths in one run for the die-hard fans.

There are currently 3 different play modes. Quest, Time Trial and Practice. There is a leader board for Quest mode progress, and for Time Trial. Each game has a seed that can be used to replay those exact levels, or a random seed can be used for exploration. The procedural map generator is still in development and can currently only generate one style of map at varying difficulties. Future updates will see other map styles added to the generation capabilities.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Arcade Moonlander was designed for speed runs from the start and features a robust timing and score system.
