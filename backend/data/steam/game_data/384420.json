    "description": "Creature Factory 2 is the second installment of the original Open Movie Workshop DVD. However, this is not a simple refresh, it's an entirely different workflow. Like the first part of the series, Creature Factory 2 is not meant to be a simple follow-along tutorial. Instead we witness an inspiring creative process from start to finish.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOriginally published on cloud.blender.org - August 2014. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTotal duration: 13 hours, 45 chapters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAuthor: Andy Goralczyk<br />\r\nAs a Blender 3D artist, Andy was responsible for much of the design, compositing and lighting for Elephants Dream, Big Buck Bunny, Tears Of Steel, Caminandes 2, and Cosmos Laundromat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLicense: Creative Commons Attribution 3.0.
