A small group of humans now face a decision on behalf of their planet: Should they trust the stranger that arrived from the stars?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Quarantine Circular places the fate of a vulnerable human race in your hands. Your dialogue choices in conversation with your fellow humans and off-world visitor will determine how the game plays out, and how its story ends. Work with your team to figure out if your new alien acquaintance is here to help the human race, or whether they plan to strike while the planet is weakened. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This self-contained short story takes around two hours to complete and is split into several chapters. You can play the game in one sitting or, if you prefer, unfold the story in smaller pieces that can fit into a busier schedule.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Quarantine Circular is inspired by classic adventure games and modern dialogue systems, and developed by the award-winning team behind Thomas Was Alone, Volume, and Subsurface Circular.
