    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A Word From The Devs</h2>We are a relatively small team that decided to take up the challenge to make a game in a month. This is the product of our challenge, and while we are both confident and content with how it turned out, we just want to make everyone aware that this game was created in only one month. It does not have a <i>ton</i> of content, but it does offer a unique arcade puzzle game experience with a solid amount of replayability and provides great laughs with friends.<br><br>Please feel free to contact us if you have any feedback, questions, or problems, and be on the lookout for our future games!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Drinks</h2><br><strong>At Cypher's, every drink is a puzzle!</strong><br><br>In Uh Oh Bartender, you will be serving drinks to patrons as any bartender would, but unlike other bars, the ingredients of the drinks you serve will be dictated by a procedurally generated name, as will the cups they are served in, and any garnishes they are served with. All of these factors are based on &quot;rules&quot; that may or may not be present within a given drink name.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1097760/extras/show.PNG?t=1585347708\" /></span><br><br>Rules present in any given name may include; looking for certain letter sequences found within the drink name, adding up the numbers in the year at the end of the drink name, or even paying attention to the font of the drink name itself! Be careful though, because you don't have all day to decipher what ingredients are included, as each order will be on a timer. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1097760/extras/4c13aeb2a3b76959019a161a5168eb7a.poster.avif?t=1585347708\" width=600 height=332 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1097760/extras/4c13aeb2a3b76959019a161a5168eb7a.webm?t=1585347708\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1097760/extras/4c13aeb2a3b76959019a161a5168eb7a.mp4?t=1585347708\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>As you continue to serve correct orders, your score will increase, but so will the complexity of the order! <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1097760/extras/longname.PNG?t=1585347708\" /></span><br><br>Don't worry about memorizing every single rule out of the gate, as you'll have a handy cheat sheet that you can pull up to reference every rule that the game has to offer.
