It's called Old Port, because it remembers times of great sailing ships and brave people who used to sail them. Each nook of this charming town has it's own story from distant times.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This is where Tony and Annie live. They are 10 years old and their heads are full of dreams. They have made friends with the Captain, an old sea dog, who traveled many seas and knows lots of tales from distant lands. There were times when they all together set off for long voyages. They got to know faraway regions and people who live there. From each of their journey, they brought lots of presents from their new friends. They also wrote many letters and postcards in which they invited each other to visit their homes. The postman always had to carry a heavy bag, filled with lots of mail. He wasn't very happy about it, but... a letter must be delivered - that's the duty.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1439150/extras/662e30999b4cf6ac781e7d5df329874e.avif?t=1745593258\" width=800 height=258 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Once, on a beautiful July day, as usual the postman arrived at Tony and Annie's door. However this time he didn't have his bag full and he just handed a single letter to the kids. There was a strong chill coming from it, like it has been mailed from a very cold place. It seemed that the other letters got scared of that cold and decided no to get in the postman's bag - that's why there was only this single one. <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1439150/extras/216aa30718a39be50ec79fe62c9fef27.avif?t=1745593258\" width=800 height=258 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong><i>KEY FEATURES</i></strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >- Colorful and enchanting scenery. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >- 5 chapters full of adventure and more than 30 locations from all over the world; </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >- Ecological theme with NO violence - promoting empathy and understanding the game is more than safe for your kid; </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >- Two speeds in the same game -  storytelling of the slow-paces adventure side works just great with action and dynamics of mini-games; </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >- &quot;One click&quot; interface - our mouse based interface is extremely simple, for most of the time you click only one mouse button to perform various actions.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1439150/extras/b314d84113aaa846ba11b842d5cfcf60.avif?t=1745593258\" width=430 height=320 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Silver Games</strong> is a collection of classic titles from 20 years ago – games that, despite their age, still captivate with their atmosphere, creativity, and old-school charm.
