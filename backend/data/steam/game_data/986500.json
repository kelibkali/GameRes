    "description": "A dual stage survival FPS/Defense/strategy zombie game; a DSSFPSDSZG you could say...¯\\_(ツ)_/¯<br />\r\nStage 1 (Birds-eye-view strategy): Place defense mechanisms such as turrets, mines, etc around you.<br />\r\nStage 2 (FPS): Shoot incendiary rounds at the zombies from your powerful cannon!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn summary, there are a bunch of zombies and cannons.  So, shoot the zombies with the cannons.  You could say the gore, the cannons, the zombies, and this entire game are all uncalled for, lacking good reason, and unwarranted i.e. gratuitous.  <br />\r\nWe agree.  That's why we name this game GRATUITOUS ZOMBIE CANNON!!!",
