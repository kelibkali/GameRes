Each character can summon his own &quot;magic&quot; arena where he becomes the boss of the level for a short amount of time. Each character can be knocked out with one hit in standing in &quot;danger&quot; zone. Once the &quot;magic&quot; arena is summoned by one of the 15 combatants - the fighting game becomes an arcade while the &quot;boss&quot; player is trying to defeat the opponent before the magic arena time runs out.<br><br>You can find Write-N-Fight merch store on Redbubble!<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1666500/extras/82c7989f0167723b829a8bd3c9cb0b65.poster.avif?t=1710241543\" width=616 height=300 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1666500/extras/82c7989f0167723b829a8bd3c9cb0b65.webm?t=1710241543\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><br><br>Included game modes:<br><br>- 2x Speed mode - a good way to train superhuman reaction<br><br>- Prophet mode - turns the game into a turn-based strategy in a way.
