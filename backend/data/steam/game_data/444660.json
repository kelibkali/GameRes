Creating good and balanced characters with the right stats, skills, equipments, items and spells combinations is what matters the most.

Choosing which spell to use, when and how to use them, and the positionning of your warriors and choosing the right targets are what will bring you victory.<br><br><strong>Key Features :</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>    Single player action RPG where you control a party of 5 characters that you create with no class restriction, they are how you decide, completely.<br></li><li>    Very intense real-time tactical gameplay that keeps you on your toes.
