    "description": "Dojo based mostly on skill, you need to be accurate and agile to both take down enemies and dodge incoming projectiles. Progression is based on player skill and training rather than unlocks. Like many arcade style games. Personal progress and a high score is the goal. This game becomes difficult quickly and has a high skill bar if you want to make it past the first few rounds. Dojo is designed so that only a few determined archers will reach the higher waves.",
