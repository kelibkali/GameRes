    "description": "Call Me Under is a queer, eldritch noir tale that takes place in the mysterious underwater city of Styx, a haven inhabited by humans, Sirens, and other otherworldly beings. <br><br>Play as a choice of two different faceless protagonists from The Surface seeking to leave their past behind. They say there’s nothing like a clean slate, but maybe not if you find yourself thrown into the middle of a brewing fight between the Shadows and the Light – two ancient entities embroiled in a centuries-long battle for power.<br><br>As a rookie detective, you’ll investigate the various missing persons cases littering the streets of Styx. Why have so many gone missing? Who, or what, is behind their disappearances? And why are sudden earthquakes rattling the city?<br><br>Call Me Under is a story about destiny, questioning the morality of yourself and those around you, and asking yourself exactly what defines ‘good’ and ‘evil.’ Though you’ll decide whether to bathe in darkness or reach for the light, there’s no telling what others will do. As you get to know the important players in this mystery, you’ll find that these characters revel in the gray crevices where secrets lie, waiting to be found.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1475120/extras/c034632754676ae858e624b92e6c1a1e.avif?t=1703017268\" width=546 height=102 /></span><br><br><strong>Choose Your Story:</strong> Play as either the Human or the Skia, each with a unique route and with the ability to choose your pronouns.<br><br><strong>Meet (and Romance) a Diverse Cast:</strong> Get to know, befriend, antagonize, or fall in love with an eclectic cast of humans and Sirens.
