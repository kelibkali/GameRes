It was built over the course of many long years and is designed to be a chaotic burst of action with an aesthetic that throws back to a previous generation. <br><br>Vanguard is a high speed, arcade style, 3D shooter. Prepare to speed through a carefully crafted experience that will push your precision, reaction, and timing abilities in order to weave through obstacles and enemy attacks. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/652890/extras/11a45a8f456d824ea5ba14190b8a8f6e.avif?t=1574869265\" width=600 height=230 /></span><br>Engage in frantic dogfights, massive bosses, and  use a plethora of cutting edge weapons in order to defend what is left of your home world. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/652890/extras/94d8bfc5e9069cea3ec0de9dd8f45f8f.avif?t=1574869265\" width=600 height=230 /></span><br>The action for the game will fall into two categories. The first is an on-rail mode where the goal is simply to survive to the end while destroying as many enemies as possible. The second  is a all-range combat mode where the player is free to move any direction they chose in order to navigate an environment and take down enemies as they see fit.",
