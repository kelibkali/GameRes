    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Mythic Monsters #4: Mounts</strong></h2><strong>The fourth volume in our new Mythic Monsters series, Mythic Monsters: Mounts</strong> brings you a full complement of amazing mounts for your heroes to tame, or to face bearing their greatest foes into battle. Fully TWENTY of your favorite  mounts are here, updated for the mythic rules, and when we say updated we mean complete stat blocks. More than that, every noble steed has its own unique and exciting new mythic abilities, from a mythic ponys inexplicable survival to a mythic nightmare cauchemars deaths ride, from a the aerial aid of a mythic hippogriff to the unbridled glory of a mythic pegasus champion.<br><i>This product includes mythic mounts of commonplace varieties like horses, camels, and riding dogs, as well as exotic mounts like the sleipnir, dragon horse, and triceratops, including advanced variants that take the basic creatures up to a whole new level, covering CRs from 1 to 15. In addition to these twenty mount stat blocks, <strong>Mythic Monsters: Mounts</strong> also includes mythic feats and path abilities geared toward mounted mythic characters and classes with mount-based abilities.</i><br>The Mythic Monsters series from Legendary Games brings you dynamic and exciting mechanics alongside evocative and cinematic new abilities that really help creatures live up to their flavor text, whether they are creatures of real-world myth and legend or creatures born out of the RPG tradition itself. These creatures can work just as well in a non-mythic campaign as they do in one that incorporates the full mythic rules, as you can throw them at your jaded players who think theyve seen it all or know the standard monster stats as well as you do. That look of surprise and What was THAT? will warm any GMs heart.<br><strong>Requirements:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included Pathfinder ruleset.<br><i>Conversion by:</i> <strong>Tony Lindberg</strong><br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Tony Lindberg</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included Pathfinder RPG and D&amp;D 3.5/ OGL ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
