    "description": "Untitled Space Game is a local multiplayer PvP game.<br />\r\nWith a plethora of game options you can play any way you like.<br />\r\nAdjustable health, options for powerups, different game modes and up to 3 players.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeat your friends, get money, buy better weapons, beat them more!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nModes:<br />\r\nThere are three modes: Normal mode, Simple Mode and Party mode.<br />\r\nIn Normal mode you get money for kills to buy better weapons, shields, and dashes.<br />\r\nIn Party mode after each round the rules change.<br />\r\nSimple mode is simple, no money only one weapon last alive wins.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayer Health:<br />\r\nPlayer health can be adjusted from 1 - 100.<br />\r\nThe way the game is played varies widely depending on what health you choose.<br />\r\nFor maximum strategy we recommend playing on instant death.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPowerups (Option to turn these off):<br />\r\nThere are 4 Powerups:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDouble Speed. (Doubles your speed)<br />\r\nMore bullets. (Decreases the cooldown in between shots)<br />\r\nMore Spray. (Increases the amount of spray and the angle of it)<br />\r\nHp + (Refills your HP (Only appears when not on instant death))<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTurning on powerups will also drop small asteroids from the top of the screen, so when the timer counts down to zero make sure you don't get hit because it's an instant death no matter how much health you have!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDashing (Option to turn it off):<br />\r\nEvery few seconds you can dash which will send you a short distance instantly in the way you are moving.<br />\r\nWhen dashing you are teleported and all obstructions in the way to not matter and you will take no damage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote: Although there is a one player mode, for maximum fun we recommend playing with friends.<br />\r\nNote 2: A Gamepad is not needed for 2 players. But for three players you will need to plug in a gamepad.",
