    "description": "Zen Studios enlisted the talents of Hungarian maestro Arthur Valentin Grósz (Operencia: The Stolen Sun) to compose a soundtrack he himself describes as, “a bit hard to grasp. Like steampunk itself, while it can be defined, it derives from many different genres just as this soundtrack. It is based upon symphonic music from baroque to romanticism all the way through the modern movie soundtracks, which are heavily influenced by electronic music.”",
