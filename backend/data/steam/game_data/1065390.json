There, the user will enjoy interacting with the TV series characters and elements. Until suddenly Rubius, in a desperate call, will ask the user for help.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nMagic, adventure and fun during an amazing trip where everyone will be able to measure his heroic qualities, after having designed their very own avatar identity.",
