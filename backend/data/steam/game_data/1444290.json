    "description": "<strong><u>Overview</u></strong><br>Star Mine is a 3D first person perspective space shoot 'em up game with both elevation, descent and 360 degree motion. You enter each mine from hyperspace and then fly through it between the enclosing walls and the laser grid which protect the interior. Blast the star jewels from the asteroids and steal cargo from alien space ships. Avoid lightening conductors, worm holes and attractor fields. Collect shield, hyperspace and weapon energy before escaping to the next mine.<br><br><strong><u>Two Free Levels Included</u></strong><br>The demo includes the first two levels of the game, which if completed lead to a splash screen. There are no other restrictions on the demo. The first two levels do not include some of the features that are present in the full game such as keys, attractor fields and conductors.<br><br><strong><u>Assistant and Goals</u></strong><br>The demo includes a computer assistant that highlights hazards, provides hints and warns of threats.<br><br>The goal of the game is to shoot asteroids to mine the required number of star jewels before hyper-spacing out of the mine.",
