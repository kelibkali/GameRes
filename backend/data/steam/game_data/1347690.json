    "description": "* Track on the trailer is Electro Light - Symbolism from NCS. Track not included in the game. Rhythm detection is automatic using a real time algorithm *<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGroove Balls is Disco Escrima. An intense rhythm game that equips you with sticks and blades and pits you against a barrage of balls generated by the music.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBalls come in two colours. Starting from empty handed, you grab a ball to charge a weapon for one shot. If you then strike a ball of the same colour you score a hit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStriking the other colour won't score immediately but will set the weapon to omni which can hit any colour. Final score depends on matching balls and weapons. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe groove is automatically detected with fine detail from your own mp3 so you can enjoy your favourite music tracks while having a mental and physical workout.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game's difficulty is automatically adjusted in real time based on the player's performance making for dynamic, enjoyable and always challenging playthroughs.",
