IX<br></li><li>DCS: WWII Assets Pack<br></li><li>DCS: The Channel Map</li></ul><br>During the winter of 1942-43, the air battle raging in the skies over Europe was at its fiercest. The Focke Wulfs and Messerschmitts flown by the Luftwaffe’s ’experten’ proved to be more than a worthy foe for the RAF’s new Spitfire Mk.IX-s. The air supremacy of the Allies was still just a distant dream. In the thickest of this battle stood the Biggin Hill Wing with 611 (West Lancashire) and 340 (Ile de France) Squadrons. As a result of thorough research in the national archives, squadron records and combat reports, Reflected Simulations managed to recreate 14 of these sorties down to the smallest details. Come, join 611 Squadron at the height of the air war over Europe, and experience what it was like to be a fighter pilot in the RAF in the most realistic way that it’s ever been possible in a simulator.<br><br><strong>Key Features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>14 historical historical missions based on extensive research<br></li><li>7 further missions and cut-scenes<br></li><li>Detailed campaign documentation<br></li><li>Realistic briefings and briefing images, including separate PDF mission files<br></li><li>Unique kneeboard cards and checklists for each mission<br></li><li>Maps, official forms and pilots notes<br></li><li>Nearly a thousand specially recorded voice-over messages and radio broadcasts<br></li><li>Historically accurate custom skins<br></li><li>A wide array of missions including rodeos, circus, practice flights and scrambles</li></ul>",
