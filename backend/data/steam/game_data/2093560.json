The town fisherman and slacker <strong>Gon</strong> has disappeared: the heroine <strong>Mirai</strong> must use the powers of the <strong>Flowstone</strong> to fend off wild beasts &amp; solve puzzles in order to find him.<br><br>Level up at double speed, unlock skill perks, and find equipment to customize your build and get a taste of the exciting &amp; unique battle system of <strong>Flowstone Saga</strong>!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Exciting &amp; Unique Puzzle Battles</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2093560/extras/c2a922abba863bcb9467b5bdb9b582b4.poster.avif?t=1752160102\" width=640 height=360 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2093560/extras/c2a922abba863bcb9467b5bdb9b582b4.webm?t=1752160102\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2093560/extras/c2a922abba863bcb9467b5bdb9b582b4.mp4?t=1752160102\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Battle monsters in a truly unique <strong>puzzle-based arena</strong>! Using the power of falling blocks, you can attack, defend, and trigger magic effects to thwart everything from lowly Beewis and Cookie Ferrets to Craggans and Giant Axolotls.<br><br>By clearing lines, you'll deal damage to a monster with a regular attack. Clear multiple lines at once for much more powerful blows. But this is just the beginning!<br><br>You'll use Flow Crystals and Orbs that appear on the board to create combos, deal damage, heal, and defend yourself from deadly monsters, who can ruin your board (and your HP) with attacks like poison, fire breath, paralysis, sandstorms, and much more.<br><br>Unique <strong>Powers</strong> let you swap pieces or even throw them at monsters directly, while <strong>Consumables</strong> toss special blocks on the board to wreak havoc on your foes.<br><br>You'll also unlock Powers that allow you to infuse blocks with elemental magic like Fire, Ice, and Lightning, attack monsters directly, repair your board, and enhance combos. Combined with a passive Perk tree and even a Job System, tons of unique strategies are possible. This is unlike any RPG or puzzle game you've played!<br><br>With this system, you'll have to use your wits &amp; tactics to create the best strategy for each encounter... and the battle scenario can change at any moment!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2093560/extras/ae09cd893c6c24179c48020ea8c614e1.poster.avif?t=1752160102\" width=640 height=360 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2093560/extras/ae09cd893c6c24179c48020ea8c614e1.webm?t=1752160102\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2093560/extras/ae09cd893c6c24179c48020ea8c614e1.mp4?t=1752160102\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >New Game+</h2><br>When you complete the demo, you'll be able to continue from the beginning with your previous progress (equipment, stats, levels) saved.
