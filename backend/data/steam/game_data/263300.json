To win a round, one player must either incapacitate the other by inflicting damage through various attacks to reduce their opponent's health to zero or by having more remaining health than their opponent after the clock runs out. Every character has a weak, medium and strong attack. Also every ones has a &quot;unique&quot; technique, called a Drive attack, which is different for each character.<br><i></i><br><strong>Key Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>12 unique batants to choose from! - Choose a character that represents your own fighting style like the lightning-fast Taokaka or the wickedly powerful Tager.<br></li><li>Drive your way to victory! - Use the unique Drive Attacks specific to each character to decimate your opponent.
