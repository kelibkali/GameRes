Learning becomes much more exciting.<br>Why did we choose the name &quot;PULP&quot; for our language ? Because it has been designed to give you the pulp of the code.<br>There are few things to understand and you can learn it with our 15 tutorials.<br>Just write some lines of code and you will be thrilled to see what you can do with your brain.<br>With PULP, you are at the heart of the creation. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/995940/extras/82c3d84cee1269ac2e892f78ee3b746f.poster.avif?t=1545327878\" width=600 height=336 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/995940/extras/82c3d84cee1269ac2e892f78ee3b746f.webm?t=1545327878\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/995940/extras/82c3d84cee1269ac2e892f78ee3b746f.mp4?t=1545327878\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><strong>BUILD-IN GAMES</strong><br>These four build-in games are available (you can easily modify them and add your ideas) :<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Pop Island (1-2 players) - a CTF game. It’s an adaptation of our first Pop Island joyfully released on the Nintendo consoles in 2006 and 2007 (90% NintendoLife 90% NintendoWorldReport). You put yourself in a penguin' shoes and your team is counting on you. The same frantic capture the flag style gameplay returns in all of its glory.<br></li><li>Fish &amp; Shark (1 player) - a Run &amp; Jump game. It’s simple game to play and to code. You will swim inside an infinity pool, trying to collect coins to increase your score. The game has one control only, touch to jump. The longer you tap, the higher your fish/ shark will jump. You need to avoid hitting the building by jumping through it.<br></li><li>Five Minutes Before (1-2 players). You only have, you guessed it, five minutes to save the lives of those you see on rooftops as you pilot your futuristic aircraft. You will fly your powerful craft gliding between buildings, plunging towards the ground, and then swooping back up on your extreme mission!<br></li><li>One Shot (2 players) FPS. Found some ammo and find your opponent. Be careful, you will win or loose with one bullet.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/995940/extras/1c85e0f47e500db14a879a9ccf5fcbc5.poster.avif?t=1545327878\" width=600 height=336 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/995940/extras/1c85e0f47e500db14a879a9ccf5fcbc5.webm?t=1545327878\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/995940/extras/1c85e0f47e500db14a879a9ccf5fcbc5.mp4?t=1545327878\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><strong>ASSETS :</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The ultimate sandbox!<br></li><li>Learn &quot;PULP&quot;, a language close to C with some additions like the lists.
