But what does it mean?&quot;</i><br><br>City of Edges is a walking simulator that tells the story of a misfit: you, made of &quot;roundness&quot;, in a city full of sharp and broken edges.  In this 30-60 minute game, you will wander across this unfriendly place in search of answers and, eventually, others that are also unique in their own way.<br><br>Take your time and explore this world. Live the metaphor, feel the sound, and be unique.",
