    "description": "<i>Rafael is contracted to make thirty-one games throughout the month of December for a blatant shovelware company. His friend Liam buys stock in the company without knowing about the extremely strict deadlines. Their mutual friend Liv decides to help out by making the music for Rafael's games. Throughout the course of the next month, the three get a little too involved.​</i><br><br>The December Effect is a work of interactive fiction about the dynamic between three characters, but it's also a narrative-driven collection of 31 games, which were each made in one day (irl!). The game takes place inside a chat client, and the games are accessed by clicking on attachments.",
