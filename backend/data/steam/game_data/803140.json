Battle Carnival provides 6 characters at launch and we plan to add one character per month during 2018. You can pick whatever characters you like to start off the match then change it every round considering the situation of your team. So the communication with your teammates is the key to win. <br><br><br><strong>Non-P2W</strong><br>Battle Carnival is non-p2w online shooter. Everything you can purchase in the game wouldn't have any in-game stat bonus neither it will require you to play ridiculous amount of time to get ahead like leveling up some weapon cards to become stronger. It's not RPG, it's shooter. All characters are free-to-play so you will not have to buy characters including new ones. Come &amp; compete fairly.<br><br><strong>Team up before the Battle</strong><br>You can find/make new friends to team up ahead to the Battle at our official Discord.<br>",
