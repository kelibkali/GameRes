    "description": "Rule the high seas in Broadside: Perilous Waters!  Sail the world, sink enemies, join forces with friends, defend your nation from other warring nations or pirates.  Make money through trade, manufacturing, fishing, or combat.  So load your cannons, bring enough food and water for your crew, and prepare for action!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBroadside: Perilous Waters is an indie free to play MMO set approximately at the turn of the 19th century.  The game includes PVP, PVE, and &quot;full loot&quot; combat mechanics.  Loot is easy to gain, but just as easy to lose.  If your ship sinks it is gone, but the same is true for your foes.  Don't worry, you can get more ships!",
