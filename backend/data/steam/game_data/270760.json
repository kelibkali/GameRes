Based on Germany's most popular pen &amp; paper role playing game, it was also the first German computer RPG series to get widely recognized outside of its home country. To this day it holds a stable hardcore fanbase that loves the games for their comprehensive adaption of the pen &amp; paper ruleset and the believable medieval fantasy setting.",
