Employed by Forward Industries, they managed to transfer human consciousness to the digital space. But after trying to back out of the project, things took an unexpected turn. Held against their will, Nyla finds herself in a situation that forces her to use the technology in the very way she feared it would be.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >From the beginning until one of five possible endings, you experience the entire story from the perspective of Linh's consciousness in the digital world. As Nyla's sister, you participate in the events as they unfold, enabling and enhancing the system's capabilities from within.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The selfish vs compassionate choices you make along the way will define your past while shaping your future.
