    "description": "<strong>Ragdoll Runners is a physics-based Track and Field game where you control independently the two legs of an athlete to compete in 8 events of different types: sprint, long jump, triple jump, hurdles.</strong><br><br>You run with two keys: one key per leg. So you cannot count on pounding your keyboard to achieve victory like in most athletics games. You require good timing and mental strength.<br><br>At first, you run and jump in a disjointed fashion, causing funny situations. However, the better you get, the more your actions resemble those of true champions and it becomes very rewarding.<br><br>A third key allows to lean forward on certain occasions: to finish a sprint, a jump, or to jump over a hurdle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Game Modes</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Solo</strong>: compete against increasingly strong opponents and become a champion in each event.<br></li><li><strong>Splitscreen</strong>: play against 3 friends on the same computer (gamepad supported), like in this hilarious video.<br></li><li><strong>Online</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Confront the world record and your friends' records.<br></li><li>Challenge mode: compete against increasingly strong records from the leaderboards and become a concurrent for other players.<br></li><li>Daily Contest : experience the stress of competition with a limited number of attempts each day. Do your best in each event to score the most points in the Octathlon.</li></ul></li></ul><br>You can try the web demo!<br><br>Note: in case it's not obvious, this game is very different from QWOP.",
