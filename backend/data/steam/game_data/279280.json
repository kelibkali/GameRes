    "description": "Ohmicide:Melohman is an audio fx plugin which takes the concept of multi-band distortion further. Thanks to a new, more versatile technology as well as a modern interface and live performance-oriented features, Ohmicide is the both the best sound killer ever and your bread and butter tool to accurately work colour, shape and texture on every track.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>up to 4 bands, each with a heap of control over dynamics (compress, expand, gate), distortion (gain, type, bias and one extra disto-dependant control), pan (mid side mode included) and even a feedback generator (as in: &quot;my guitar is too close to my amp because I like it that way, any problem sir ?&quot;)<br></li><li>37 disto types multiplied by 3 modes (standard, ampsim, odd) for each: yes, that's 111 distortions to pick from. This means you have all the classics (overdrive, puncher, bit crusher, etc.) and a heap of totally unique ones (Jelly Fish, Frozen, Hip, etc.) allowing you to work on &quot;signature&quot; sounds that truly will be your own.<br></li><li>unique melohman preset morphing technology. Use your midi keyboard to morph between presets live for spectactular transition or insane beat design!<br></li><li>state of the art UI. No &quot;clip&quot; on fine tuning your knob here, thanks to sub-pixel accuracy. Enjoy a slight bit of inertia for controle so good you won't touch your midi controler (midi bind still supported though)<br></li><li>over 1000 presets for bass, guitar, drum, synth, vocal and general purposes<br></li><li>register once installed and get access to 32-bit and 64-bit Mac &amp; PC versions (VST, AU, RTAS and soon AAX)</li></ul>",
