    "description": "A First-Person Shooter game in which the main goal is to capture and secure objectives in a map and winning by draining other team's conquest points.<br />\r\nAs a Grunt you have a selection of five classes to pick from Demolition, Support, Medic, Marksman and SpecOps<br />\r\nVarious land and air vehicles to pick from depending on map and the higher the base level the more free vehicles will become available for the team along with more powerful classes and perks. Private vehicles cost score points and some are locked behind base level. Random supply trucks spawn in a map which if delivered back to team base will upgrade it one level, also bomb trucks will randomly spawn in a map and if delivered to the enemy base it will downgrade by one level so keeping an eye for these trucks might be the key to winning a match.",
