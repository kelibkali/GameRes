And after several rounds of building chaos, you face off in a Ridiculous Round with a unique, bigger modifier. After this, all modifiers reset and you get to do it all over again. In Arcade mode, you get to choose all the stages, guns, and modifiers that you want to play with.<br><br><u>Retro Revival</u><br>Every stage is based off of a classic movie genre.
