War on Mars is a 2.5D RTS game in which you have to play the role of a captain who is in command of a whole war battalion. You may ask why the war battalion? As it turned out, Mars is not a planet without living souls. It is inhabited by <strong>bloodthirsty beasts</strong>, with which communication is almost a miracle. Nevertheless, these creatures do not enjoy the presence of other species. They hate everyone. That is why your battalion has become an intruder whom the beasts will absolutely want to annihilate.
