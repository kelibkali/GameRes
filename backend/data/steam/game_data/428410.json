The only problem is that not every block is active at the same time. You must toggle between Red, Yellow, and Blue blocks to navigate each level without getting shot by turrets, impaled on spikes, or falling to your death.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/428410/extras/66c30fa98ba254faa56d00754aec4e0f.webp?t=1478028084\" width=622 height=37 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 50 Action-Packed Levels<br></li><li> Endless Mode<br></li><li> A Fully Functional Level editor<br></li><li> Striking Visuals<br></li><li> A Gorgeous Original Soundtrack<br></li><li> Full Controller Support<br></li><li> Color-Blind Friendly</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Campaign</h2>PRiO comes with 50 exciting levels to keep you busy for hours upon hours.

You could be the proud owner of a fully functional level editor to create your own masterpiecel. Save and load levels for later! Not only that, but you can even copy the level-code to your clipboard and paste it somewhere for your friends to copy and paste into their own editor. No file transfers necessary!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Visuals</h2>PRiO was meant to be a visually pleasing experience. While the gameplay itself is challenging, your eyes will have a wonderful time letting in all the beautiful lighting effects and particles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Soundtrack</h2>The absolutely gorgeous soundtrack for this game was created by Erik Danielson at <strong></strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Color-Blind Friendly</h2>Because PRiO is about the three primary colors, it comes with a color-blind option for those who need it. <br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/428410/extras/66c30fa98ba254faa56d00754aec4e0f.webp?t=1478028084\" width=622 height=37 /></span><br><br><i>PRiO is currently only available on Windows.</i><br><br><i>Please note:</i> The game is completely functional using a keyboard and mouse, however it's highly recommended that you use a Gamepad to play PRiO.",
