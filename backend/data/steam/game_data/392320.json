Stay on your toes or this galaxy will devour you.</strong><br><br>Retrobooster is an exceptionally difficult 2.5D shooter, focused on skill-based flying and enemy blasting. Pilot your nimble thrust ship through bizarre worlds littered with vicious enemies. Each new level takes you farther from home and, ultimately, into the deadliest reaches of the galaxy. Retrobooster also has speed-flying challenges, puzzles, juicy monsters, a warped sense of humor, and a healthy dose of bullet hell action.
