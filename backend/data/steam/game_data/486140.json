We have priced the game with the consideration to increase prices in the future with more content updates, somewhat like an early access title / pre-order. All proceeds will go towards game content.<br>Early buyers get free content updates although if there isn't much interest in this genre, there's the risk of little future content. <br>We appreciate all feedback and support (in terms of comments or reviews)!",
