    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >STORY</h2>The story of the game is based on sci-fi novel &quot;Frango Anomaly&quot;. The hero is a human clone who escaped from space pirates. The first location is asteroid FA-17, colonized a couple of millennia ago. The mining of crystals is still ongoing, but... right now crystals are dropping in price. If it weren't for the convenient location for the transshipment base, the asteroid would have been abandoned long ago. However, entire areas of the asteroid have already been abandoned. Life here moves at its own pace and by its own rules.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1113220/extras/c51f77003b900be49d64b5a44505cdc7.apng?t=1610253980\"><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1113220/extras/c51f77003b900be49d64b5a44505cdc7.poster.avif?t=1610253980\" class=\"bb_img\" width=522 height=323 /></picture></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >STYLE</h2>Absolutely all the graphics in the game are made using the characters that could be typed on the keyboard.

However, these characters are not involved in the design.
