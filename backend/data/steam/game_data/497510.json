    "description": "When you start the game you find yourself on a field sprinkled with crystals and other goodies. Your job is to collect all the crystals while avoiding the mines – not to mention the 12 breeds of nasties and their bullets that soon turn up to try and stop you. Once you collect all the crystals, an exit at the bottom of the screen opens up so you can escape. Sounds simple? All the best games are – the depth of gameplay emerges from the simplest of pretexts.<br><br>Crystal Quest Classic is a revival of the 1987 award winning video game. The original was played on almost every Macintosh computer in existence before being ported to the Apple IIgs, Amiga and the Game Boy – followed many years later by a reawakening on the Xbox360. It had so many firsts including being the very first color game on the Macintosh. Crystal Quest was one of 5 titles included in Macworld Magazine’s “Game Hall of Fame” and got 5 out of 5 mice from MacUser Magazine.<br><br><strong><i>“Crystal Quest cost me some of the best hours of my life. Nice to see it back and nice conversion. It looks, feels, and sounds just the way I remember it.”</i> – Bob “Dr. Mac” LeVitus</strong><br><br>There are bonuses, smart bombs and mines. There are also 12 achievements that you can earn. Some are harder than others.<br><br>This is an early game designed by Carmageddon creator Patrick Buckland, with all the art and sound effects just as he created them. And yes, the level exit sound is Patrick.",
