Skara is now available for PC on the Steam Store. Easy to learn, hard to master, only the best can be legendary, remembered forever in Skara lore. Will you be among the next Skara heroes?<br><br><br><strong>Fast-paced combat with timing and accuracy focus</strong><br>Each survivor has his own 3rd person combat style with a personalized set of close combat movements and skills to fight in frenetic skirmishes.<br><br><strong>Team fighting synergies between characters</strong><br>In order to master the game you will need to learn the specificities of each culture’s combat style to take advantage of your survivor’s and play as a cohesive group of warriors, powering each other’s strengths.<br><br><strong>Quick multiplayer matches</strong><br>You can choose different game modes ranging approximately from 3 to 10 minutes. You cannot hide in the arenas, so you must kill your enemies before they kill you.<br><br><strong>Game modes</strong><br>Right now we have 2 game modes: a 1v1 “Duel” and a 3v3 “Last Team Standing”. And 3 arenas: “Jaarvi” is the icy scenario for the Duels and “Khilma - Lava Coliseum” with “Gâo-di - Temple of the Zem” are the two scenarios where the Last Team Standing matches take place. <br>A 5v5 “Domination” is planned to come in the future. We will soon start working on 5v5 “Siege Battles”. Nearly all of them contain interactive elements. Danger is everywhere.<br><br><strong>Lore-Rich</strong><br>We have been working for the last four years to create a cohesive and rich Skara World with a strong culture background. We will introduce it to you through: in-game specific entries, some lore-related events, quotes from each Skara’s Culture in our medias and a ready to be published novel.<br><br><strong>Cosmetic based monetization system</strong><br>You will be able to personalise your survivors with aesthetic elements such as skins,  emotes, victory poses and dyes.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/274620/extras/421a772579670b05e5b3c3b4fc10a7a3.avif?t=1565084641\" width=616 height=360 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/274620/extras/8244b513ff9965ab9a011cac00231b28.webp?t=1565084641\" width=616 height=42 /></span><br><br>Playing Skara automatically means you have a say in its continued development. <br><br>From achievements to game modes, there are a whole host of details that we leave open to you, the players, to decide.
