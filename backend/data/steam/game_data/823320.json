Try to catch as many as possible without dying and take them to the collecting area and set your score. More hornets you collect at once more bonus you recive 1=1, 10=100, 100=100000 You need a minimum of 500 points each game to keep your rank status frozen. The challenge is to bring 100 hornets at once to the collector and be awarded with 100000 bonus points. At the end of the game your score will be showed on the LeaderBoard and you can see your rank in the main menu. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMultiplayer<br />\r\nwork in progress...you can connect with your friends and play against each other (10 players max) or cooperate and catch as many hornets you can.....in progress: lag, matchmaking, mods,...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe CrazyHousePlanes are equipped with three types of weapons. The main source of damage is your faithful machine gun, always ready to burn down your foes..well, almost always, you might want to throw an eye on your ammo count every now and then. Your heavy duty damage output comes from the homing missile launcher, lock your targets when you keep them in your crosshair for a short period of time - the lock-on is indicated by a sound. The third, situational weapon are the rear bombs. Rear bombs are best used against those enemies who don't keep their flying safety distance in check, giving you a proper defense. As this weapon is only meant to be a defensive weapon, it does not increase kill count.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game can be played in 1st person or 3rd person. After each game, the players are rewarded with trophies.",
