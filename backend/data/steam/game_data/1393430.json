    "description": "War breaks out on the eastern continent and Lorret's Fourth Regiment are forced to launch a counter attack. But as the death count rises questions start to emerge as to the true cause of the conflict.<br><br>Through 26+ campaign maps spanning 5 acts discover the secrets of Project Carridin, a military project that was abruptly killed four years ago, and uncover who really is behind this war and what they could possibly want from the doomed project.<br><br>Banality Wars Carridin is the spiritual successor to Advance Wars Days Of Ruin. It features a more impactful story (but don't worry, it's not <strong>as</strong> dark) and gameplay that that is more varied than what you'd expect to see in an Advance Wars-like.",
