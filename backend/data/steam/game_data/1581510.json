    "description": "The first expansion is one of the simplest, and the most like just &quot;more Dominion.&quot; It pushes decisions, with &quot;choose one&quot; cards, and has Victory cards with abilities. Also includes some extra-vicious attacks.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1581510/extras/aa8837dcd6fbc3bbd73ccd1aa82d52c1.avif?t=1706777088\" width=600 height=224 /></span><br>The Intrigue expansion unlocks 5 &amp; 6 player games. In these, four piles emptied ends the game rather than the usual three.  <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1581510/extras/a7930dbd4fd62d3a014170ad43c87e72.avif?t=1706777088\" width=600 height=224 /></span><br>Intrigue has cards that give players a choice between two or more options. A player given a choice picks any choice, even if unable to do the instruction, then does as much of it as they can. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1581510/extras/c36043ea43bf4735c0e6c0e0e43a239f.avif?t=1706777088\" width=600 height=224 /></span><br>Intrigue has three Victory cards that have an additional type.

The steward smiles at you like he has a secret, or like he thinks you have a secret, or like you think he thinks you have a secret. There are secret plots brewing, you’re sure of it. At the very least, there are yours. A passing servant murmurs, “The eggs are on the plate.” You frantically search your code book for the translation before realizing he means that breakfast is ready. Excellent. Everything is going according to plan.</i> <br>-- Donald X.
