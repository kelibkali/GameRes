    "description": "In a quiet night, our hero sleeps after a long day of hard work.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut, abruptly, a mob of evil birds fiercely invaded his house!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, our blue hero needs to turn into fire in order to get rid of the nasty birds!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGreat Ball of Fire is a platform/ puzzle game developed by Drink Cash, a team of two twin brothers. Daniel Noronha ( design and coding) and Gabriel Noronha ( soundtrack). We live in Bauru, São Paulo, Brazil.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are 4 worlds with 15 levels each, In each level you need to beat all the birds in the level and collect a key, in order to get out of the room. Picking at least 10 keys is enough to be able to enter the boss room.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHave fun and screw these birds! :)",
