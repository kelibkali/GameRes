    "description": "In the near future humans manage to create machines smart enough to carry out almost any task they are given. However, the humans become victims of their own success when they create machines that are so smart they no longer need humans to survive and decide to destroy their makers. Humankind is on the brink of destruction at the mercy of these super smart machines who possess advanced AI. But one machine is faulty. An error in its programming causes it to have an <strong>AI Anomaly</strong>. Instead of seeking to destroy its makers, this heroic little blue robot knows it must save mankind from the mindless onslaught of its fellow machines.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Run, jump, climb, use hand-over-hand manoeuvres and slide down poles 'fireman-style' as you battle through twenty action-packed levels.<br></li><li>Visit a wide variety of different location types.<br></li><li>Encounter moving and rotating hazards galore!<br></li><li>Use moving or static platforms with different properties; some helpful, some not so much!<br></li><li>Try out different possible pathways through many of the levels.<br></li><li>Less frustrating than Super Meat Boy!</li></ul>",
