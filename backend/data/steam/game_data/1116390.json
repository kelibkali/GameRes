Trapped aboard the voidship TRH Rusanov, Samuel Edwards must evade, fight and kill his former crew-mates as an outbreak transforms them into monsters. There's only one way out and an entire ship to cross. Danger lurks around every corner and time is running out. Explore the depths of the Rusanov, pull whatever resources you can out of its guts, and run.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1116390/extras/e37cc431c6eb8b6b8b8e0484761c8a4a.poster.avif?t=1761744340\" width=600 height=240 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1116390/extras/e37cc431c6eb8b6b8b8e0484761c8a4a.webm?t=1761744340\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1116390/extras/e37cc431c6eb8b6b8b8e0484761c8a4a.mp4?t=1761744340\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>As Chief Medical Officer of the Rusanov, Edwards has a confident, in-depth understanding of medicinal drugs. Routine medication can be repurposed for more creative ideas, or transformed into something more extreme.

This means that morality is not just about what you want as a player, as every decision will have an effect on Edwards.

Humans on board have mostly fallen victim to the outbreak, twisting their limbs and stretching their bodies into creatures that are near-unrecognisable. Robots are becoming unstable; some turn violent and roam the ship's corridors, while others break down in a state of utter panic. Between the remains of the crew, the confused husks of metal and other terrors that skulk in every shadow, every engagement could be Samuel's last.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1116390/extras/0dda20944812cbc7706f096d50e8d18c.webp?t=1761744340\" width=599 height=51 /></span>",
