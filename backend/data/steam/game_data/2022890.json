Movement parts such as wheels, wings and hover blades need to be built with redundancy in mind, as parts can get shot off during the course of a battle. Bots may be built block by block, but will be stronger, and more intricate, when you use advanced build plates. Each bot is centered on a core which has limited HP and must be protected. Any part that is disconnected from the core will be lost instantly, so multiple strong connections are needed for an optimal design. <br>  </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong><u>Weapons/Movement</u></strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2022890/extras/72f5509ac126f0717106ce690c9613b7.avif?t=1772193904\" width=800 height=450 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > <br>You will have to be creative and clever when designing your bots.
