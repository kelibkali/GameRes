Starting with just a Hangolin, beat down enemy Critterbytes to collect their energy, an important resource for upgrading Hangolin, or buying new Critterbytes for your team, or purchasing some usable items, or obtaining some buffs to increase your combat prowess. There's lots of choice, so where's the best place to spend that Nature energy?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4300960/extras/c919e0e001b310994500267fde578ada.poster.avif?t=1769700797\" width=616 height=346 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4300960/extras/c919e0e001b310994500267fde578ada.webm?t=1769700797\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/4300960/extras/c919e0e001b310994500267fde578ada.mp4?t=1769700797\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Critterbyte Royale is a hybrid idler/hack n slash game. If you fancy playing, take control of one of your Critterbytes and lay the smackdown on some enemies or place down your usable items for some handy benefits like healing or a poison bomb.
