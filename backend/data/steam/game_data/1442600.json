    "description": "<i>An Ensemble of Four Seasons</i> -- An original arrangement that chronologically features the four in-game season loops, welding them together into one grand musical movement that underlines the grand narrative of the game. The official title track tries to bridge the gap between a <i>Chiptune Aesthetic</i> and a higher quality <i>Orchestral Production</i>. In this bundle you can hear both at the same time, or exclusively listen to the individual versions. All versions you hear in-game are included as part of the bundle. Includes two <strong>bonus tracks</strong>: <i>An Ensemble of Four Seasons [orchestral version]</i> and <i>What Goes Up Must Come Down (Beta Title Theme) [CanPixel remix]</i>.",
