    "description": "I made a 2D action game. Aim for the top of the tower with a height of 1000m.<br />\r\nThe player is constantly moving and flips left and right when hitting a wall. Jump in a timely manner and aim for the top.<br />\r\nOnce you go to the point where the flag is, you will be able to return there immediately.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n【Method of operation】<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnly jumps. You can switch between jumping with the &quot;jump button&quot; or &quot;tap the screen&quot; in the settings. In the case of &quot;jump button&quot;, you can change the position of the button in the settings. You can also jump with the space key.<br />\r\nYou can quickly return to the location of the flag once you have passed it with the button.",
