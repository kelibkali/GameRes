    "description": "<strong>Legendary Tracks</strong> is a line of DLCs for <strong>Automobilista</strong>, celebrating the heritage of classic racing circuits throughout their history. Part 3 is now here: The Hockenheimring.<br><br>Host of the German GP for 35 years, the Hockenheimring is one of the tracks with the richest heritage in the world of motorsports. Historically known for its bygone classic layout with long straights through the surrounding forests, the track was reformed for the 2002 German GP, becoming much shorter modern circuit but retaining a high speed, flowing nature perfectly suited for wheel-to-wheel racing with all types of cars.<br><br>This pack features 4 distinct versions of this legendary track from 4 different decades - 1977, 1988, 2001 and 2016, along with extra modern layouts (National, Short A &amp; B). The Rallycross layout will be added shortly to the package.",
