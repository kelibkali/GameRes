The Salvadoran army sets up an offensive with the aim of overthrowing the president of Honduras, who is accused of spoliation against Salvadorian immigrants. Honduras is trying to hold the enemy's offensive in order to allow the international community to step in and call for a cease fire.<br><br>Soccer 1969 lasts 17 turns each of 8 hours between the 14th and 20th July 1969. It opposes two nations in Central America, the Honduras and El Salvador, when a tense football (a.k.a. soccer) match for the 1970 World Cup goes awry.<br><br>Strengths of both sides are weak. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The Salvadorans have the initiative and stronger land forces, <br></li><li>but Honduras has a larger air force.</li></ul><br>The game event cards allow full replay ability thanks to the numerous various situations that they create on the diplomatic, military, political or economical fields.<br><br>Be careful, intervention of the OAS or deaths of the President will end the game sooner than expected.<br><br><strong>Estimated Playtime</strong>: 2h00.<br><strong>Favored Side</strong>: none.<br><strong>Hardest to Play</strong>: none.",
