Work, revenge, political conspiracies, a banana balloon… it seems everything was meant to clash on this specific day.<br><br>It's finally time to overcome the crossed paths of Port Valley’s singular <i>citizens</i> and unfold the obscure plot that is tying together these <i>apparently</i> unrelated stories.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Some Key Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>3 plots, 3 main characters, 3 mayoral candidates</strong>… 3 chances to unfold a bigger and complex story.<br></li><li><strong>A renewed <i>(yet classic!)</i> Point &amp; Click interface.</strong><br></li><li><strong>A light-hearted, comical tone with annoying self-aware humor.</strong> <i>(Which doesn't necessarily mean this is just a comedy *wink* *wink*.)</i><br></li><li><strong>Even more annoying puzzles with different ways to solve them.</strong> For real.<br></li><li><strong>Active NPCs.</strong> They also have objectives, they're not 'just there' to give you stuff. <br></li><li><strong>It's surprisingly not about detectives.</strong> <i>(I swear it's legal in this genre.)</i><br></li><li><strong>There's a dog...?</strong></li></ul><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/904450/extras/12c8884c3704c33e37247610aef1e1df.poster.avif?t=1726600602\" width=284 height=140 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/904450/extras/12c8884c3704c33e37247610aef1e1df.webm?t=1726600602\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The 2022 DEMO</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>It's an hour-long experience with all-new content focused on gameplay, animations and the new UI.<br></li><li>The puzzles and the plot have been simplified so it can be played as an independent thing.
