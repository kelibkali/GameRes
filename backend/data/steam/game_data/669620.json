    "description": "The Necromancer's Castle is a sidescroller where you play as a wizard trying to get back a stolen magic diamond from an evil necromancer. You go from room to room, and in each room the doors will be blocked. Enemies will enter the room and start chasing you, and you have to defeat all the enemies to get to the next room. Enemies have different stats and abilities based on their appearance. As you progress you will learn new spells.",
