Blast your way through waves of enemies with a multitude of weapons at your disposal. Full controller support included.<br><br>True to its name, this twin-stick, top-down, 2D shooter features an alarmingly large arsenal to choose from. As waves of hostile enemy robots approach, it’s up to you to decide the best way to take them out. Whether you wield the rapid-fire machine gun, the unpredictable “Shaky Wibbly Minigun,” the wildly wide-spread Boomer or beyond – the perfect weapon for the job is at your fingertips.<br><br>Every time you play this game it will be a very different experience. One game, you may get trounced during the first wave, left with no health left for the rest of the game. The next, you may pick up a Boomer halfway through the first wave and tear down your enemies just as quickly as they appear.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1312540/extras/a40fc13b180859695c853dd6bb194d1f.avif?t=1670244667\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Over 1.3 million randomly generated gun combinations<br></li><li>3 distinct enemy variations</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Several Challenge Modes:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Pistol only<br></li><li>Tank Enemies only<br></li><li>Low Oxygen Mode<br></li><li>Endless Mode<br></li><li>One HP Mode<br></li><li>Tiny Enemies Mode</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1312540/extras/a0314dc9cb71f37107ea1d9189626940.avif?t=1670244667\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><br>This game was developed as a student project at DigiPen Institute of Technology and was created for educational purposes only.
