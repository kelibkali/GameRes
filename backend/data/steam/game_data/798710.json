The game certainly offers value for money and hours of game play. Voltage was originally a peaceful place. But since the C-I Advanced Department of Technology is trying to eliminate the player they bring a massive army of enemies inside the game. Complete all Episode 1 Sublevels* and bring peace back to the Voltage!<br><br>Full version of the Voltage: Episode 1 includes 8 huge Sublevels:<br><br><strong>Sublevel 1: Tutorial Zone</strong> <br>This is optional on the game menu. We found out that some players were unfamiliar about box pushing and using switches, so on this optional level you learn the game logic. On the Tutorial Zone, you can practice many important skills and get to know to the game. Remember that you can always ask help from the Steam Community Hub.<br><br><strong>Sublevel 2: Warm-up</strong> <br>A little warm-up before you start...<br><br><strong>Sublevel 3: Hometown</strong> <br>Actual game starts at your hometown, and your mission is to find Amiga 500 computer inside the house and start your adventure in AOSYS... After you have found computer, your journey in AOSYS starts. We noticed that many player was interesting to explore hometown on the first version, so now this level is even more bigger, including many houses and surprises.<br><br><strong>Sublevel X: Dark Side</strong><br>Voltage Dark Side is mystic environment. Voltage has it's sunny side and Dark Side is place where AOSYS system spawns the &quot;dead&quot; characters, in order to Voltage run smoothly. When player enters to the Voltage he will be accidently spawned to this environment and mission is to find way out...<br><br><strong>Sublevel 4: Star Qruiser</strong> <br>First mission is called 'Escape from the Star Cruiser': You are in a Star Cruiser. Seems that something has gone badly wrong and it's full of enemies (we don't reveal what kind of...). This level gives you about a 100-130 min gameplay. The game proceeds almost straightforwardly (spaceship is quite big) when you explore different parts of Star Cruiser and you desperate to escape... Boldly explore the Star Cruiser, who knows if you might even be able to find dinosaurs on their development section...<br><br><strong>Sublevel 5: Terraria</strong> <br>In this sublevel you explore the space ship Terraria. Terraria is a place, which is used to harvest food to space ship crew. Terraria is also used to farm some extraordinally special animals, such as Dinosaurs. Be carefully not to release them from their cages...<br><br><strong>Sublevel 6: Into the Desert</strong><br>You have escaped from the Star Cruiser by using emergency shuttle. Unfortunately an error occurs and you find yourself from a burning hot desert. Try to find familiar town, or some vehicle to escape...<br><br><strong>Sublevel 7: BunkerWay</strong><br>You discovered way to the Bunker on previous level. This is the only &quot;safe&quot; way to the Voltage Town (Episode 2). Explore large sections on the bunker and find your way...<br><br>Goal is to include VoltageDinoLand, City of Voltage and Town of Voltage to the Episode 2.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Special features, which are now available</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Turn on and off switches</strong> <br></li><li> <strong>Ability to dive and swim</strong> <br></li><li> <strong>Push and move movable objects.

Stephen J. McRegon, scientist, computer engineer, and something an a dreamer was asked to help a medium large computer company, to create a ultimate virtual reality system, which was ahead of time. And he did it. On year 1982 he created an open world game for Amiga personal computer, called AOSYS, Amiga operating system. AOSYS was capable to unlock incredible hidden features in Amiga 500, able to take full advantage of it's potential. Unfortunately it was never introduced to the markets in your dimension, where you read this message. Until this day came. McRegon found a way to blend space and time by simple breaking the law's of nature; He was sending radio waves Faster Than Light and that way broke the Cosmic Speed Limit. That maneuver opened a portal (which can be used only for sending small mass objects or voice), and hence deliver AOSYS to our dimension. For you all to play. You see, all physical objects, even you and your chair, exist in three dimensions. Everything has a width, and a high and a length. But there is another kind of length, a length in time.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/798710/extras/156d348c8476ca13194cec36cd04dec0.avif?t=1709737946\" width=582 height=598 /></span><br><br><i>All characters and locations used in this game are fictitious in our universe and any resemblance to real persons, vehicles and places is purely coincidental.</i><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/798710/extras/4ce9f79383d403b8862e41e5281c96a5.avif?t=1709737946\" width=583 height=306 /></span><br><br><strong>The game contains the instruction manual.
