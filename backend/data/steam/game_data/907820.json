    "description": "<strong>Aeon of Sands – The Trail</strong> is a roleplaying game set in a post-apocalyptic desert world. It combines real-time exploration gameplay with classic gamebooks where you create your very own non-linear story adventure.<br><br>You play the vain and clumsy Setrani, a simple clerk aspiring to a simple life. But in the post-apocalyptic world of Aeon of Sands, nothing is ever that easy... A single missing caravan will set plans in motion, and seal the fate of our unlikely hero.<br><br><strong><i>What if your favorite “Choose your own Adventure” book was, instead of crumpled pages to turn and dice to throw, an epic FPP dungeon crawler?</i></strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >FEATURES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The world of Aeon of Sands may be lethal, but it is not humorless.
