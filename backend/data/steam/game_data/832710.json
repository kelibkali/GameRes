Inspired by classic games from the 90s, the game adds new juicy features to modernize a classic genre of role playing games.<br>The 7th Circle - Endless Nightmare is a journey into your subconscious; each character, each Alter Ego, represents a different personality, but they are all sharing the same goal: to discover what is hidden in the darkest part of your mind and free it from its demons.<br>The blood slowly flows down from your wrists. You're about to faint...you are finally going to die, you know it. The blade falls from your hand. You hit the floor in a puddle of blood.<br>You are dying. And this is just the beginning of your journey.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/832710/extras/600ba91ff3a4acef0cecaf659045fdb4.avif?t=1582890756\" width=616 height=117 /></span><br><br>The game has a dark and creepy tone with a good amount of violence and gore. The gameplay isn't set in a specific time period, but the setting is more like a mix of different elements, some from the past (like old weapons or the dungeons themself) and some from a more modern era (like tv screens), while all the cutscenes are clearly set in the present.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/832710/extras/323a208b7ee8ea4df9e6b12b5285143d.avif?t=1582890756\" width=616 height=117 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/832710/extras/bc3042ff2bc282a85e11884ac819a208.webp?t=1582890756\" width=24 height=24 /></span> Create your Alter Ego customizing attributes, skills, personality, traits and perks.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/832710/extras/bc3042ff2bc282a85e11884ac819a208.webp?t=1582890756\" width=24 height=24 /></span> Perma-Death: use only one character at a time.
