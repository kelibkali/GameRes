This is an officially licensed game based on the live-action monster wrestling group Kaiju Big Battel, who have been performing their Godzilla-meets-WWE act for over 20 years.<br><br>Designed for Kaiju fans and newcomers alike, Fighto Fantasy takes players on a quest across time and space as they work to undo damage caused by the evil Dr. Cube as he rampages through history in search of fame and glory. With seven main playable heroes (and a secret one to unlock), players explore six time periods and punch out dozens of deadly monsters.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/611710/extras/7446e786e5a9a150fb3e5c6158191c64.avif?t=1737654777\" width=600 height=90 /></span><br><br>All the world is watching as the Kaiju Big Battel Title Fight is about to begin: The diabolical Dr. Cube vs. the patriotic pugilist, American Beetle!
