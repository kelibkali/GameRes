Instead of taking preventive architectural caution like say, fire escapes, the only company on the planet is deciding to hire you to prepare for any impending crises. Trial out corporate-provided tools (oft comprised of dangerous materials themselves) to create evacuation protocols that prevent imminent chaos and guide the alien species known as 'Pammies' to safety.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1529430/extras/8856540673a45486f0b489408a2ab589.poster.avif?t=1704381349\" width=640 height=360 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1529430/extras/8856540673a45486f0b489408a2ab589.webm?t=1704381349\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1529430/extras/8856540673a45486f0b489408a2ab589.mp4?t=1704381349\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><i>Pammies are devoted, productive, and docile employees - unfortunately they aren't great at taking the initiative or general awareness.</i><br><br>Disasters are likely to occur in any building - it’s your role to survey the area and plonk down contraptions to guide the employees to safety. These new crisis protocols will be used by the company for all future emergencies. After setting things up, run the crisis simulation to check the effectiveness of the safety protocol. In short - save the pammies!
