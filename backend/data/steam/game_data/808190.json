    "description": "<strong>Super Sonic Racer</strong> has it all with twelve over the top wacky characters and vehicles: From space shuttle to monster truck, from pizza dude or taxi driver to a magnetic superbike from the year 2400, everything you can imagine (and more) will race against each other in 4 crazy worlds, Karting like never before.<br><br>If you finished first, you are the winner. After winning four races in a world, the next world will unlock.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The different worlds are;</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Ocean World</strong> - In this world you will race through a fantastic underwater environment.  The Ocean World is a living planet that is entirely covered in water. <br><br></li><li><strong>Trash World</strong> - Have you always wondered where that garbage you throw away each week has been going?  The answer is Trash World.<br> <br></li><li><strong>Game World</strong> - This game-themed world is a blast to race in, and it is no wonder so many drivers fly in to partake in the competitive races.  <br><br></li><li><strong>Nightmare World</strong> - It’s dark, creepy, slimy, scary; It’s everything that you can (but don't want to) imagine.  Only the bravest of all racers make it this far, but it takes a Supersonic Racer to win.</li></ul>",
