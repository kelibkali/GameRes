    "description": "After an impressive success on smartphone, more than 10 downloads including 3 of unknown origin, we can talk about intergalactic success and draw the following conclusions:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The extra terrestrials exist<br></li><li>They play Xploquest</li></ul><br>For this reason and answering the growing demand (a friend asked for it yesterday), Xploquest finally arrives on Steam.<br><br>Yes, you read correctly. Our teams (me and myself) worked hard to offer Xploquest on Windows, Mac and Linux.<br><br><i>But what is Xploquest?</i><br><br>Xploquest has all the features of indie game:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>It’s ugly but with a lot of charm<br></li><li>It’s cheap<br></li><li>It’s played like an old game but with a current interface<br></li><li>It’s done with love</li></ul><br><i>What else?</i><br><br>Xploquest is a retro RPG inspired by the greatest:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Ultima<br></li><li>Might &amp; Magic<br></li><li>Legend of Zelda<br></li><li>Dragon's eye</li></ul><br>The moves are tile-based and fighting is turn based. You explore the world freely and discover new places, dungeons and caves.<br><i><br>Okay, but what are the real assets?</i><br><br>Ok you want something concrete:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>It’s hard, the game only saves when you're in a city. If you explore without being ready, you may die very quickly.<br></li><li>No tiresome scenario, endless dialogs with tasteless NPCs. In Xploquest, you are alone, you do what you want, as you want.<br></li><li>A clear quest system. When you accept a quest, it appears on the map. (xploquest 2)<br></li><li>Perfect for both long and short game sessions.<br></li><li>You can give up Xploquest for weeks and come back without wondering what to do. In addition, the game will not blame you for this absence.<br></li><li>You can play other RPG at the same time.<br></li><li>Perfect for a break.</li></ul><i><br>Well, I'm intrigued and almost interested. I need an argument that kills.</i><br><br>Easy, I kept the best for last:<br><br>In Xploquest, as in any role-playing game, you earn gold. The difference with others is that you can spend it.<br>Whether it's equipment, skills, food, potions or scrolls, you'll have to pay.<br>Fights only bring in experience and gold, the chess contain gold (and maybe something else for some.<br>No more depressed to have millions of gold coins without being able to spend them.<br>In Xploquest, managing your gold is a very important aspect of the game.<br><i><br>I am convinced. Last question: is there a goal?</i><br><br>Yes the game ends when you have explored all the floors of the tower. For this you will have to find the 10 keys that will unlock each floor.<br><br><i>It's perfect. The final word ?</i><br>It's free, guaranteed without advertising and without in-app purchase.<br><br>I developed the game, it's up to you now.",
