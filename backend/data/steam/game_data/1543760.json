    "description": "Steep Slopes is a snowboarding endless runner game! Attempt to gather the most amount of points by grinding ramps, hopping around, and jumping off ramps before you crash! Steep Slopes creates obstacles to either avoid or attempt to score points with. You can move between three lanes, jump in the air, and grind on logs. If you score a high score Steep Slopes will save that high score locally! This game contains sound effects and music, which you can mute in the settings menu. It also works on most resolutions by changing between three window sizes (small, medium, and large) in the settings menu.",
