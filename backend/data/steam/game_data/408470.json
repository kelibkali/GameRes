    "description": "Re-live a dark and haunting tale in this fixed camera puzzle-horror game RE-miniscent of the first generation of survival horror games. Using both CCTV cameras and your upgradable RC surveillance unit, you have to keep your eyes and ears sharp in order to take photos and unearth a chilling event that unfolded years ago.<br><br><strong>Monetized youtube videos and twitch streams are strongly encouraged! Share your videos in our community hub section!<br><br>Warning: This game contains flashing lights which may not be suitable for people with photosensitive epilepsy</strong><br><br><strong>A small percentage of users may experience a bug that causes the last photo taken to appear incorrectly. Possible causes are alt-tabbing out of game play, or clicking outside of the window in &quot;windowed mode&quot;. If this happens, it's best to restart the game and load the last chapter closest to where the bug occurred in your play session. (Image of bug.)</strong>",
