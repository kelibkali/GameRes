    "description": "<strong>Knight`s Pride is a sort of an incremental RPG game...</strong><br><br>This game isn`t rich storywise! It plays almost as much as Knights and Dungeons another game of mines....<br>This is also not an Idle game and battles aren`t automated. This game is about actively doing repeatable tasks <br>to unlock new content such as new gear and new enemies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Questions</h2><br><strong>Does this game has a nice story like other RPGmaker games?</strong><br><i>Answer: No!</i><br><br><strong>Will I be able to recruit new chars in this game?</strong><br><i>Answer: No!</i><br><br><strong>Does this game has Idle game mechanics?</strong><br><i>Answer: No!</i><br><br><strong>Who is this game indicated for?</strong><br><i>This game is indicated for players that enjoy doing repeatable tasks to unlock new progress...</i><br><br><strong>What does this game plays like?</strong><br><i>This game plays like a real job....
