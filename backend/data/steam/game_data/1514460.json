In Part 1 you play as Jack Cutter, a father who is struggling to keep his family together in the face of an otherworldly threat coming from the nearby military base. In Part 2 you control Karen, a calculated assassin on the hunt for a mysterious girl in the same remote town of Grey Ville. Finally, in Part 3 you will swap between both of the characters and help them form an unlikely alliance and face the overbearing danger as a team.<br><br>Together, they will help the remaining survivors escape from the zombie invasion brought upon them by a mad scientist. It won’t be easy though, in their way stand bloodthirsty monsters, hostile military personnel, the cruel local sheriff, and the hardest obstacle of them all - the demons of their pasts. How will their story end? That’s entirely up to you. Will you make the right choices?<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1514460/extras/d38c5d5875e589ac26f4f6ff2176b85e.webp?t=1675944543\" width=616 height=16 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1514460/extras/b7b5661cdd10bd59ae8d757dc864885c.poster.avif?t=1675944543\" width=614 height=114 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1514460/extras/b7b5661cdd10bd59ae8d757dc864885c.webm?t=1675944543\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1514460/extras/b7b5661cdd10bd59ae8d757dc864885c.mp4?t=1675944543\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1514460/extras/d38c5d5875e589ac26f4f6ff2176b85e.webp?t=1675944543\" width=616 height=16 /></span><br>During your playthrough, you’ll have over 200 decisions to make and they will all influence how the plot progresses, so choose wisely. Will you help save humanity from the zombie outbreak or will you take the selfish path and save yourself and those dearest to you? No choice is a wrong choice but think through each and every step or you may just step off a cliff.<br><br>The Perseverance series draws from stories like “Night of the Living Dead”, “28 Days Later”, “Blindness”, “Revivals” and most of all – “The Walking Dead”. The main goal of the series is to show the drama of individuals in the face of terrifying events.",
