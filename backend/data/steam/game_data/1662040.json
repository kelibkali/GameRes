Death and destruction runs rampant, where nightmarish invaders sap the land of its very life force. Earth has become dry and barren and skies are covered by heavy clouds. Only the moon is still bright up above. Once the protector and guide of the world, now only a sad reminder of the past and harbinger of the end.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1662040/extras/5394169c93f0dc97fe76e5c5760e2a96.avif?t=1728294348\" width=606 height=540 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Plot</h2>Our protagonist is called the Wanderer. An immortal man locked into an endless cycle of death and rebirth. While he cannot die, the repeated trauma caused him to gradually lose memories, his name and even his purpose. He meets the so-called Patron, a shady traveler with mysterious powers. While powerful, he is deeply wounded and cannot travel by himself. The two come to an unwilling agreement. Wanderer will become the host for the Patron and he in turn will protect them. As when the world dies neither immortality nor power will mean anything.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1662040/extras/901cf4fdf5744d83c7100277cfe561ce.avif?t=1728294348\" width=606 height=340 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Combat</h2>Immersive, fast-paces, first-person combat. Tear enemies apart with claws and gradually acquire skills (such as time manipulation or ranged attacks). Each subsequent opponent will require appropriate tactic, and taking on too many enemies at once usually will result in a quick death. However, death is also a part of the mechanics – if felled, our immortal protagonist will use the experience to grow stronger and unlock new skills. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1662040/extras/cf55f52a0cce6696ae4af2e25a9e1098.avif?t=1728294348\" width=606 height=340 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1662040/extras/6405ebcd88d928697fea0fcfed3d39d9.avif?t=1728294348\" width=606 height=340 /></span>",
