    "description": "Two teams of adorable murder-bots duke it out over a number of rounds. One side attempts to plant and detonate bombs in their opponents’ base, and the other, quite reasonably, attempts to stop them. <br><br>Designed for 4-versus-4 players, each round earns money (or &quot;volts&quot;) which the teams can spend on outlandish equipment and weaponry. Take a stealth suit, slip past the enemy’s defences and snipe from the shadows, or dive straight into the fray, deflecting incoming shots with the reflector shield. Or toss a time bomb into the mosh-pit and watch as bullets and bots dance in balletic slow-motion! Synchronize with your team to achieve the best strategy and claim ultimate victory!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Built especially for PC, with fluid controls tuned for WASD movement and mouse-aim.<br></li><li>Cool traversal abilities - dashing, teleportation, jet shoes and grappling hooks.<br></li><li>Five unique suits with abilities such as Time Distortion, Time Booster, Bullet Deflector, Cloaking, and Kinetic Absorber!<br></li><li>Over 30 different kinds of weapons and tools!<br></li><li>Mecha-styled vehicles to bring to the battle!<br></li><li>Damage-bonus hit zones including: head, eye and from behind!<br></li><li>10 maps at launch and more to come, plus workshop maps!<br></li><li>4 versus 4 multi-player with dedicated server software!<br></li><li>Customizable characters and UI/crosshair settings!</li></ul><br>Cobalt WASD is a FAIR GAME and a FULL GAME!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>No pay-to-win!<br></li><li>No loot crates!<br></li><li>No edition exclusives!<br></li><li>No day one DLC!</li></ul>",
