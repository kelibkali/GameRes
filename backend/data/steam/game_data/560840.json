    "description": "TOOTINIS!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTootinis is an action packed puzzle adventure game in full 3D filled with original monsters, music and gameplay. Use your bubble spitting powers to smash or push monsters, solve puzzles and save your village. The gameplay is an original mix of action and puzzle elements.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplore 10 levels of monster fighting and puzzle-solving action in full 3D. Find the magic key to open the gates and move forward. Collect magic diamonds to unlock new levels. As you explore the maze, you smash, fry, and blast the monsters. If you solve the puzzles and avoid traps and monsters, you will at last rescue your friends and save the day. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe gameplay is based on your ability to spit bubbles that pushes the target backwards. The player must use this ability to make opponents and different objects collide. Whenever a game entity collides into another, something happens; 20 entities means 20 times 20 = 400 possible outcomes. In addition you will meet several boss monsters that will put your gaming skills to the test. Sometimes the player must release or push different monsters against each other to be able to advance. Random effects, odd creatures and exploding objects are part of the fun. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you move along, you will find magic fruits that gives you special abilities, for example super speed, or powerful chilis that makes you shoot exploding bubbles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame levels are carefully designed to exploit both the action and puzzle potential of game objects and creatures.

Later on they are blocked by or consists of different monsters, and the player must discover different ways to move them away or terminate them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is not always obvious how to solve the puzzle that leads to a new area.
