    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>About the game</strong></h2><br>Sanctum Breach is a challenging top down ARPG with an old school vibe! Build your character and fight to reclaim your birth right!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Story</strong></h2><br>The world is falling into disarray as the device used for millennia by the Gods, the Auxillium Porta, has been destroyed in a conflict between the Gods and their offspring, of which you are one. The gods sole purpose for the Auxillium Porta was to intervene in the ways of Man and prevent them from ultimately damning themselves and the world in which they inhabit. Now you must work to unite the shattered device. By finding its fragments scattered across the universe you hope to undo the damage your siblings wrought and carry on your Father's legacy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Character Development</strong></h2><br>There are a myriad of different methods that can help you to diversify and strengthen you character. Gold can be found by killing enemies encountered on your travels and spent in the Goblin's Gift, after you complete his quest. This grants you points in Resistances and Damages.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1194770/extras/5e95a59511496b8a7776d5c98c530ebb.avif?t=1623172742\" width=600 height=416 /></span><br><br>When you level up you gain a point to be spent in the Passive Trees. The Passive Trees have nodes for every pretty much every Stat in the game and are split up into 3 separate trees. You can allocate points anywhere but must follow the paths and Cluster point requirements. At the end of each Cluster is a Keystone which has a dramatic effect, such as &quot;on hit&quot;, or &quot;on damage taken&quot;. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1194770/extras/bacabeeecf3a28981ea3ada95a4b5035.avif?t=1623172742\" width=500 height=280 /></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1194770/extras/5837a4a6101f127120f33526f2e70416.avif?t=1623172742\" width=500 height=280 /></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1194770/extras/75ed4b702c21fca2fd8e925f48b4ddf7.avif?t=1623172742\" width=500 height=280 /></span><br><br>Skills can also be levelled up and gain a natural increase in Damage upon doing so. They also gain a point to be spent in their individual Skill Trees. These trees enhance the Skill in a multitude of ways, with 8 minor nodes that offer various stat increases, 4 major nodes that modify the skills functionality, and then 4 augment nodes that further enhance that modification. These nodes must be unlocked sequentially. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1194770/extras/b57d564904e59d1e188c2345e8ff0efe.avif?t=1623172742\" width=600 height=322 /></span><br><br>Items come in 8 different rarities, some of which have powerful and unique Skills associated with them. They can either modify current skills or add an effect to the character, such as &quot;cast a Fireball on hit&quot;, or &quot;reduce cooldown on kill&quot;.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1194770/extras/1f1bb3766b749d9ff6a324c89df236f0.avif?t=1623172742\" width=218 height=350 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Endgame Content</strong></h2><br>Endgame Content is the major focus of the game and there is a plethora to choose from, so everyone can find something they love!<br><br>Conquests are a series of encampments with a selection of thematic enemies and a mini boss. Once they have been defeated the player will face a super boss in a 1v1 encounter. Conquests also have a random modifier applied to them, such as &quot;immune to Fire damage&quot;. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1194770/extras/8a8fd21a66a3bd274c4eb16546c1e93b.avif?t=1623172742\" width=600 height=322 /></span><br><br>Mythical Trials offer a unique challenge based on the type of Mythical creature. For example in &quot;Flight of the Phoenix&quot; the player must hunt down the Phoenix and fight his multiple phases, after which he is reborn stronger and more deadlier than before. &quot;Maze of the Minotaur&quot; sees the player tracking the Minotaur down through his maze, constantly alert for his &quot;Shadow Form&quot;, which cannot be killed, and must be evaded!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1194770/extras/e569b3c78cecd1db225aee1e47b5681b.avif?t=1623172742\" width=600 height=324 /></span><br><br>Boss Encounters are a 1v1 fight with a Super Boss.
