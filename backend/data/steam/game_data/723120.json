    "description": "Enjoy an interesting twist on classic poetry by solving puzzles and following the story of the Wilkins Family inside your very own journal. From the islands of Finland to the snowy mountains of Russia, you’ll explore and experience beautiful maps based on real world locations in this puzzle game with a unique theme. With the power of the Unreal Engine behind it, Immersive Poetry is definitely a title you don’t want to miss. Read on if you need some more convincing!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Maps</h2>In Immersive Poetry, each map is based on a real-world location using inspiration from the nature found in those areas. You will get to see the pine trees in Yellowstone National Park, to one of many Finnish islands, complete with seagulls, fish, and vegetation natural to the country. Each map, or “Level”, has its own mystery to solve alongside the original objectives presented. <strong>All maps are only available in the full version of the game.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Soundtrack</h2>The soundtrack in Immersive Poetry is a wonderful time of piano music, each track fitted into the level as naturally as possible. Hate it when games have the same 3-minute loop over and over again? Not around here, you won’t! Each level has plenty of gorgeous music, so there won’t be any repetitiveness around here!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Your Journal</h2>In Immersive Poetry, your journal will be your guide. This journal will contain story elements and is updated each time you complete a level or complete a secret objective. Be sure to check your journal periodically to get hints about hidden secrets in each level!<br>Puzzles<br>Immersive Poetry is filled with different types of interesting puzzles and objects to discover. YOU will uncover the mystery behind the Wilkins family journal. Think hard, because the answer won’t always be right in front of you!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Progress Tracker</h2>Wondering if you missed something in a level? That’s okay! Check out your progress tracker to see if you need to return. Can YOU get all those bars to 100%? Don't forget about the achievements! <strong>This is ONLY available in the full version of the game.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What about the Future?</h2>With Immersive Poetry, the possibilities are practically endless, and the future will reflect that.
