    "description": "Laureate of the Epic Game Jam of November 2015.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou are a replacement doctor, responsible for finding out which of the three patients is the one that is contaminated. To do this, you can use a range of experiments to perform on the patients. You can also ask the guard to do the dirty work for you. You must choose only one patient to kill or .. Maybe this job is too hard for you and you will take the last option .. to not choose ...<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat is Who Must Die?<br />\r\nWho Must Die is a simulation offering an experience similar to an &quot;escape room&quot; in which you play a doctor. The goal is to make the player aware of his choices and the consequences this may have for a human life. Explore, search, make your choice and observe directly the result of your investigation.<br />\r\nWe chose to put videos of the team in order to make the game even more fun and convincing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhy did you create Who Must Die?<br />\r\nThe first prototype of Who Must Die was made for the Epic Game Jam in November 2015. The game won the first prize of the jam and received many positive reviews (youtube, specialized press, Epic Games), The team decided to make it an improved version, longer and mostly replayable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat is White Chamber?<br />\r\nWe are 5 French students who are passionate about video games at the end of the course. This small motivated team and full of ambition is composed of 2 Game artists, 2 Game Programmers and 1 Sound designer.<br />\r\nThe game is published by Plugin Digital which allows us to propose you today this game on Steam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanks to hard work and an ongoing investment we can now offer you the game in full version.<br />\r\nWe hope you will enjoy as much fun as we do this game.",
