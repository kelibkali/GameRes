At one point in my life, I had over 1000 PS1 games &amp; still to this day love playing them. I have always wanted to create an accurate rendition of what a PS1 game actually looks like &amp; after spending months fine-tuning my post-processing materials, I finally feel like I have achieved what I set out to do. I love horror games and I wanted to be the one to throw my hat in the ring &amp; have people experience what my version of a PS1-style game could be.  <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2059390/extras/4cfd42b44eac281ffce23bf88af89e2d.poster.avif?t=1657873928\" width=350 height=210 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2059390/extras/4cfd42b44eac281ffce23bf88af89e2d.webm?t=1657873928\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2059390/extras/4cfd42b44eac281ffce23bf88af89e2d.mp4?t=1657873928\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2059390/extras/19730408ed09cab9d182a81a248ac52f.avif?t=1657873928\" width=446 height=98 /></span><br>Love the artwork?
