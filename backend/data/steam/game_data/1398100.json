Since then, it has spoken to people of many ideologies in countries around the world. It offers a powerful awareness of how power can be abused – and of how generation after generation seeks a more just and equal society, where the many do not suffer at the hands of the few.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1398100/extras/d8c70b7fc320b78b6bbca266d4ea2dc5.poster.avif?t=1613035991\" width=768 height=432 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1398100/extras/d8c70b7fc320b78b6bbca266d4ea2dc5.webm?t=1613035991\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1398100/extras/d8c70b7fc320b78b6bbca266d4ea2dc5.mp4?t=1613035991\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Orwell's Animal Farm brings the familiar characters and situations to the medium of a game, and to the context of 2020. Depending on how you play, you may encounter situations very close to those in the book, or others influenced by events Orwell never lived to see.<br><br>Play it to explore a classic tale from inside. Play it to try your hand at running the farm – or because you dream of spreading Animalism across the world. Play it because you've always wanted to oversee a construction project by a herd of cows. Play it because Boxer deserved better.",
