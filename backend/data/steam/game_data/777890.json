The arrival of virtual reality has provided a tremendous new platform to visualize data and collaborate in advanced ways. The Primitive programming interface is taking advantage of everything that VR can offer while applying the best practices of software analysis tools.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Spatial Interpretation</h2><br>Primitive turns the output of software analyses into interactive 3D structures that are displayed in immersive VR. A team of developers will see:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Architectural Overviews - up to several million lines of code<br></li><li> 3D Call Graphs - spatial layouts that are clearer and more memorable<br></li><li> Multi-thread Runtime Animations - allowing collaboration in debugging and performance evaluation</li></ul>",
