    "description": "<strong>Ede Tarsoly, composer of the Cardaclysm soundtrack:</strong><br>&quot;The soundtrack of Cardaclysm is meant to complement the dark fairytale-like nature of the game that flows along on the edge of serenity and darkness. Distant piano sounds mix with otherworldly, soaring female vocals to create a serene atmosphere broken only by the battle songs. Battles are different -- fierce, big horns mix with massive drums! I took inspiration from my favorite movie soundtracks and composers, recorded videos from the game and then just started composing... hopefully you'll like the result!&quot;",
