    "description": "The sim-troopers of Blood Gulch have seen their fair share of insanity over the years, but they've never faced anything quite like this. Stranded on the planet Chorus, the Reds and Blues must convince two enemy armies to join forces or suffer complete annihilation at the hands of a bloodthirsty war lord. As the final installment in the critically acclaimed Chorus Trilogy, Red vs. Blue: Season 13 is as hilarious as it is thrilling. Between deadly mercenaries, alien artifacts, and old rivalries, our hapless heroes are in for the fight of their lives in the longest running sci-fi/comedy series in American history, Red vs. Blue.",
