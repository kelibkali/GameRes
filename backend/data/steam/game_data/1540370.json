We set out to create an internet-humored, meme-loaded abomination designed to bring some joy to fellow internet degenerates like us.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><u>                                                                                                                                                  </u></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>What can you expect?</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Short answer:</strong> Dark and absurd humor.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Hans takes you on a nonsensical journey through bizarre internet-themed worlds where memes come to life, logic is an afterthought, and anything is possible. It’s a chaotic celebration of internet culture, packed with random humor and references that are sure to make you laugh, cringe, and question reality (very unlikely...)—but a strong burst of air from your nostrils is already a win!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >If you thrive on internet culture, enjoy absurd humor, and want a break from the seriousness of modern games, Hans is your perfect match.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Beyond the humor and countless references, each level brings its own set of mechanics. Some, like platforming elements and puzzles (logic &amp; trivia), will be more common. Others, such as horror survival, will only appear in certain levels. And for those who love a good challenge, there are a few secrets and unexpected surprises—just for the sharpest internet veterans to find.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><u>                                                                                                                                                  </u></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Mechanics you’ll encounter:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >    Platforming (jump &amp; run)</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >    Puzzles (logic &amp; trivia)</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >    Horror survival</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >    First- and third-person shooter elements</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >    Character switching</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >    Time limits</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >    Boss battles</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><u>                                                                                                                                                  </u></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Hans is optimized for keyboard but can be played with a controller.
