    "description": "This game was made for people looking for the ultimate challenge.<br><br>Games like 'Getting Over It', 'Cuphead' and 'Dark Souls' have nothing on this game's threat. What sets it apart is the fact that nobody has been able to beat it yet. You may think that we designed the game with a gimmick that makes it impossible, but we assure you it has been tested that the bike can make it to the tip of every peak in the game. It is not the controls either, they may take some time to get use to, but once you do they feel amazing. What makes this game so difficult is simply the game's only enemy... the terrain. Not only will you not know where to go or how to get there, but once you begin to find your way you realize it was only the beginning.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Feel the fear of falling as you ascend mountains that will rack your nerves like no game ever has </li><li> Explore a massive, peaceful, and colorful open world with fun discoveries lurking around every corner. </li><li> Learn to balance, hop, spin, flip with an infinite level of attainable skill </li><li> Complete the story, unlock the mystery, and earn new colors </li><li> Push yourself to the human limit of patience and determination </li><li> Experience an unlimited amount of gameplay as we can assure you there is always more trail to go in Bike of the Wild.<br><br>Even without all the challenge, this game is still fun to just go riding around taking in the scenery.<br><br>If you would like to practice before dropping yourself into such a brutal campaign, we recommend you try our other game Bikour. This will make sure you are prepared to take on this ultimate challenge.<br><br>Whether you are looking for an easy ride through the country side, or a psychotic ascent into madness, Bike of the Wild is an adventure for Bike lovers everywhere.<br><br>What are you afraid of?</li></ul>",
