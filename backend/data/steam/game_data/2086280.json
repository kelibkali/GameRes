Cast miracles with the power of your villager's prayer, train your creature to behave or misbehave, build elaborate villages, and fight back against the forces of evil.<br><br>You are a new god born into a two worlds. You are born into the world of the gods. At the same time, your creature is born into the world of the mortals. Your creature is your avatar in the mortal world, and inside of them is your crystal. Your crystal is your connection to the world of man. You are not the only god living, for a god cannot be killed. However, all of the other gods have long since lost their connection to the mortal world at the hands of evil. With their guidance, it's up to you to take back the world for humanity one island at a time!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2086280/extras/45a7df9257a195d1f7b8a312fde7de95.poster.avif?t=1666368065\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2086280/extras/45a7df9257a195d1f7b8a312fde7de95.webm?t=1666368065\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2086280/extras/45a7df9257a195d1f7b8a312fde7de95.mp4?t=1666368065\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Convert villages to gain skill points which can be used to unlock miracles!</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Start each island with one village and expand to control the entire map!<br></li><li>Convert human villages by impressing them or &quot;removing&quot; them.<br></li><li>Destroy evil villages and take them over to create new human villages.<br></li><li>Watch out!
