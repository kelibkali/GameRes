    "description": "The official soundtrack for award-winning solo/co-op adventure KNIGHTS AND BIKES, written and performed by Daniel Pemberton (Spiderman: Enter The Spiderverse, Dark Crystal, Birds Of Prey, King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword).<br><br>With the music we wanted you to feel the excitement, imagination, wonder, mystery and fun of being a kid and cycling around on an adventure of epic proportions.<br>It also needed to feel unique to Penfurzy island, where the game is set, in the late 1980s. So we created a sonic world as wonderful and crazy as the island itself - roping in our friend’s nine year old kid to sing punk vocals on the thrashy “I Wanna Ride My Bike”; making mad moody synthtronica for “Lazer Thunder”; stoner space dad beats on “Pontefract Rock”; the 8-bit sounds of the Magus video game console; and of course establishing the Knights And Bikes theme across the journey of Nessa and Demelza.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1276380/extras/2c9e515895f74f406b856d197cebf43c.poster.avif?t=1593510124\" width=750 height=422 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1276380/extras/2c9e515895f74f406b856d197cebf43c.webm?t=1593510124\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1276380/extras/2c9e515895f74f406b856d197cebf43c.mp4?t=1593510124\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
