Big time.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You had one day to make it to the other side of the NeoSeaTac megalopolis, but you got drunk instead and overslept. It’s not uncommon for you to screw up something as simple as taking an autolift to the Spire at the center of the city, but now you have no choice but to cut through gangcorp territory if you want any chance to make it to the drop-off in time, and they aren’t going to be happy about it. It doesn’t matter that this isn’t all your fault; your best and only friend Tommy’s in the hospital, and you were the one who stole that case from the Senator’s car. You should have known boosting random cars for whatever you can find to sell would land you up shitfuck’s creek eventually. The stuff is too hot to get rid of, and no one wants to even hear about it because it’s that damn hot.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2012680/extras/1e9c3fbab233b2a1806c38381ef1f162.poster.avif?t=1747135990\" width=640 height=360 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2012680/extras/1e9c3fbab233b2a1806c38381ef1f162.webm?t=1747135990\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2012680/extras/1e9c3fbab233b2a1806c38381ef1f162.mp4?t=1747135990\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>If you don’t get this back to the owner in time, you and Tommy are dead—as in dead-dead. And while you don’t seem to value life enough to care for yourself anymore, what little humanity a small-time crook like you still has inside manifests in caring for Tommy and not wanting the ONLY person who gives two shits about you to get hurt for something he had nothing to do with. He’s just leverage to them, and it ain’t fair, kid.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2012680/extras/1345a7bf6b3c9c3a2e5c14c591527817.poster.avif?t=1747135990\" width=640 height=360 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2012680/extras/1345a7bf6b3c9c3a2e5c14c591527817.webm?t=1747135990\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2012680/extras/1345a7bf6b3c9c3a2e5c14c591527817.mp4?t=1747135990\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You’re gonna have to get over your hate for modern gadgets and get into some magline gear to let you ride the mag.
