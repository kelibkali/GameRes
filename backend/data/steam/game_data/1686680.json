As a local hunter vicky explore valley of majuli village and try to survive long enough to discover the terrible secrets of the witch &quot;nale ba&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the valleys of Uttrakhand, horrors wait inside massive majuli village. A Witch is on the hunt, recently the incidents of men disappearing were taking place in bangalore… until now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf legends are to be believed, a witch used to roam the streets of the city of Bangalore hunting for her prey. The witch would knock on the doors at night, and try to lure men by calling them out in voices similar to that of the women they loved - mother, wife, sister. Upon hearing a familiar voice, the person would open the door, and subsequently die within the next 24 hours. This legend spread like wildfire, wreaking havoc in the city.<br />\r\nThe locals then found out a way to get rid of the witch. They started writing 'Nale Ba' on the doors, or uttering the same from inside of the house to ward off the evil spirit. 'Nale Ba' literally means 'come tomorrow' in Kannada. The witch would leave when it saw 'Nale Ba' written outside the homes. Apparently, this was the only way to send the spirit back.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n💀 True Horror Experience: You are no fighter - if you want to survive the horrors of the witch, your only chance is to run<br />\r\n💀 Inventory System: Search for key game items to help your progress, pick them up and use them from your inventory.<br />\r\n💀 Immersive Graphics: AAA-quality graphics give players a detailed, terrifying world to explore<br />\r\n💀 Physical Items: In-game objects that can be picked up and carried around the world to help in solving puzzles<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMain Objective:<br />\r\nGet out of the Village.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-no blood or gore<br />\r\n-play the game how you want, sit still or run around like crazy",
