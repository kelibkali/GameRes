    "description": "<i>The Cubedex of Boxes and Lines</i> is a collection of seven puzzles pretending to be classic games in a cubic arcade. Like puzzle hunts or escape rooms, figuring out the goal of each puzzle is, itself, part of the puzzle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Games</h2><i>The Cubedex of Boxes and Lines</i> contains seven puzzles pretending to be arcade games, each on its own face of the cube:<br><br><strong>Tennis</strong><br>It seems familiar, though you're pretty sure the original wasn't single player.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1400040/extras/e8a632a25198c76ee24f4a722bb046da.avif?t=1602265103\" width=500 height=350 /></span><br><br><strong>Box Breaker</strong><br>You've seen this one before, too. There's definitely some sort of glitch in the display hardware.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1400040/extras/70b43c380d593f467b66ecbca7c4d7ae.avif?t=1602265103\" width=500 height=350 /></span><br><br><strong>Space Rocks</strong><br>Another one you've seen a thousand times before. Where did the arcade even get these boards?<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1400040/extras/391847df509f4f3bd5365e3a348a30e8.avif?t=1602265103\" width=500 height=350 /></span><br><br><strong>Food Guy</strong><br>It kind of looks like this might be a bootleg board in an original cabinet. The ghost movement is way too easy, but the extra wrap-around paths are nice.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1400040/extras/e0e9181bb2f915327676f91c7e96b368.avif?t=1602265103\" width=500 height=350 /></span><br><br><strong>Road Agent</strong><br>Action-packed driving action! Did I mention the action?<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1400040/extras/45b4232ae064bafa8ee44dfd6b4c07fd.avif?t=1602265103\" width=500 height=350 /></span><br><br><strong>Z-Prix</strong><br>Is this an arcade port of the console original?<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1400040/extras/c94e38128f431831f783dca8670573e3.avif?t=1602265103\" width=500 height=350 /></span><br><br><strong>Meta</strong><br>Looks like you might need to fix this one before it does anything.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1400040/extras/1f4b824c77d8aa8e8bd4407a8e45fb79.avif?t=1602265103\" width=450 height=332 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Series</h2><br>Jim McCann / TCHOW llc developed the Cube* puzzle games to continue his tradition of creating midwinter puzzle hunts for his brother. The Steam releases are the first time these tiny and frustrating puzzling worlds have been available to a large audience, and contain significant enhancements relative to their original (single-member-audience) releases.<br><br><i>The Cubedex of Boxes and Lines</i> is the second game in the main series of Cube* puzzle games. It was created as a midwinter gift in 2016 and updated and polished for Steam in 2020.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Standard Notes</h2><br>Nothing in these store pages, the game web page, the game documentation, or other materials outside the game is a puzzle.<br><br><i>The Cubedex of Boxes and Lines</i> is intended to be solved without decompilation, resource snooping, or modification of game files. Indeed, these are all considered cheating. (And, really, who are you cheating but yourself? Once you know the answer, you can never discover it fairly.)<br><br>You will, however, benefit greatly from scrap paper, a good reference for standard encoding schemes, and -- potentially, though it is not required -- the ability to write some small computer programs to search for solutions to combinatorial problems.",
