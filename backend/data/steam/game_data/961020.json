Taking along a representative of each of the four guilds, a mage, a healer, a warrior and a rogue, they have to go on an adventure to find noble young men to marry. The big quest is full of dangers as they compete to become the new queen.<br><br>While on her quest your character will have to deal with bandits, rivals, but also self-doubt and a sudden need to grow up and become an adult.
