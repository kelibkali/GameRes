    "description": "'The Interview' is an experimental experience. It's not about &quot;what&quot; is the Interview, it's about &quot;why&quot;. The Interview will ask you questions, will make you decide and you will answer them. But it's not as simple as that. It's not just an interview. <br><br><strong>Your name is Adam. You're searching for a job. You walk into a white room while a voice tells you to sit in the red chair. You really don't know anything but your name. So the room starts with the experiments. Are you left-handed or right-handed? Black or white? But things start to get weirder and weirder until you realize what's going on. </strong><br><br><i>Everything is related to the red box. <br><br>That red little box.</i>",
