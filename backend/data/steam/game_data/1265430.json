    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Participate in Pleasant PvP</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Abilities have <strong>No Cooldowns</strong> and instead consume and restore mana, requiring proper <strong>Mana Management</strong> to operate efficiently. This allows good players to remain competitive in combat much longer, never needing to put themselves at a disadvantage for future fights by using crucial cooldowns.<br></li><li>To make combat more engaging and enjoyable, especially when outnumbered, there is <strong>Limited Crowd Control</strong>, <strong>Limited Healing</strong>, and <strong>Limited Movement</strong>.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Crowd Control always has prerequisites, typically breaks on damage, and is often avoidable if played correctly.<br></li><li>Shields are favored over heals. Healing and shielding often require offensive instead of defensive actions, reducing the benefit of running away and stalling.<br></li><li>Most abilities require the caster to stay still while casting. Movement speed is also slowed while strafing and even slower when walking backwards. Faster movement is available with a directional dodge every 3 seconds or by turning your back on the action and running away.</li></ul></li><li>There are <strong>No Clones</strong>, <strong>No Forced Movement</strong>, <strong>No Invincibility</strong>, <strong>No Invisibility</strong>, and <strong>No Pets</strong>. Although these mechanics can be fun to use, they can lead to very toxic and unenjoyable experiences when used against you. Every mechanic is meticulously evaluated for potential abuse; if it can cause unnecessary frustration, it is not implemented.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Form a Powerful Elemental Duality</h2>Combine the elements of Fire, Frost, Nature, Shadow, and Storm to form up to 10 Dualities. Each element consists of 7 abilities for a total of 14 abilities per Duality. Elements are designed to operate independently and do not have direct interactions with each other. Players are granted the freedom to create their own combos and synergies.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1265430/extras/7c17293e7bd04e130d8c5bd6b6c06234.poster.avif?t=1748478335\" width=616 height=230 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1265430/extras/7c17293e7bd04e130d8c5bd6b6c06234.webm?t=1748478335\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1265430/extras/7c17293e7bd04e130d8c5bd6b6c06234.mp4?t=1748478335\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1265430/extras/59ad5a52880734f3de423418be774458.poster.avif?t=1748478335\" width=616 height=230 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1265430/extras/59ad5a52880734f3de423418be774458.webm?t=1748478335\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1265430/extras/59ad5a52880734f3de423418be774458.mp4?t=1748478335\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Personalize Your Playstyle with Talents</h2>Each ability can be swapped out with various talents, fundamentally changing its behavior.
