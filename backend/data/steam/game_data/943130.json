Wanted to discover new talents from thousands of aspiring actors, guide them to fame, wealth and glory…or ruin their lives completely? Ever wanted to handle needy divas, lazy ass actors, junkies, sex addicts or complete jerks? Ever wanted to search through hundreds of casting notices to find that perfect role for a desperate client? Drive hard negotiations for a juicy backend bonus then anxiously check the box office chart  every week hoping the movie will generate a massive profit? Enjoy a series of heart attacks on ‘Upfront Week’ when the large TV networks decide whether one of your series regulars’ show will be renewed for the next season or get the boot?<br><br>If the answer to any of these questions is ‘yes’, then 'Cattle Call: Hollywood Talent Manager' will make your wildest dreams come true.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>TALENTSPOTTING</strong></h2>From A Pool Of 30,000+, randomly Generated actors<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>UNIQUE CHARACTERS</strong></h2>All actors have dozens of different “parameters” from personality, through acting skills to physical- and mental attributes<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>BOOK YOUR ACTORS</strong></h2>On 5000+ randomly generated roles in 500+ movies and tv shows each year<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>HUNDREDS OF RANDOM EVENTS</strong></h2>With minor or major impact on your game<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>NURTURE AND DEVELOP</strong></h2>Your actors and be their shrink if needed<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>IMPROVE YOUR OWN SKILLS</strong></h2>To increase your chances of becoming a “super agent”",
