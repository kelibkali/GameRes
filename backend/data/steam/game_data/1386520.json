    "description": "The eleven-year-old boy Theo, who had a fire in his house, had to move to live with his grandmother in a far away city. Left without friends and video games, the only thing left to think about was school. The boy's life changed even more when he met a strange creature living right above his room. During the day, when it is light, these creatures are quite harmless. But when the sun goes down and night comes... everything changes and they perceive people only as food. But who knows, what if they might be good friends?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1386520/extras/83e696693f3c84cb8cce29f20aa2dfba.avif?t=1625795725\" width=288 height=408 /></span><br><br>Explore your grandmother's house day and night.
