    "description": "Block Machine is a difficult yet poorly explained programming puzzle that combines the joy of doing homework for computer science class with the eerie satisfaction of toying around with Redstone in Minecraft.<br><br>In Block Machine, you build machines from blocks (who would have guessed!) to solve a variety of programming tasks. Block Machine's programming model is unique: Blocks are both code and data, and all computation happens in parallel.
