    "description": "Get an early glimpse of Groove Catcher - the rhythm game that brings the flow, groove and art. From chill and meditative to heart-pounding workouts, Groove Catcher has you covered. You got your own groove to share? Great! Make some levels in our super-natural, in-game level builder, and share them online with the world on our dedicated site [coming real soon]. We love all kinds of music so have a range of styles in the game, and it's simple to load your own for making levels. <br><br>This is our first public demo, and it's a snapshot of where we're headed. So try it out and follow us to see everything else we have planned that's coming down the road!<br><br>This demo is limited with a smaller selection of levels and songs.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1301450/extras/83e28358ddab356be9a67ab2b55bdbc7.avif?t=1591799921\" width=800 height=450 /></span>",
