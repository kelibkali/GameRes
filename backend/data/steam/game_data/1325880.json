Embark on a highly unusual journey — one that might bring your cherished girlfriend’s soul back from the Shadow World, a purgatory-like realm. Granted the ability to travel between dimensions, you will use this power, along with a few helping hands from otherworldly beings, to solve puzzles that will ultimately lead you to your love’s final resting place in the great beyond. Visiting the Shadow World is no easy feat, however. With corrupted creatures inhabiting this mirror dimension, you will make friends — and many enemies — along the way while unearthing ancient secrets, none of which were meant for the living to discover.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Multi-dimensional Traveler</strong><br>There’s no luggage check for this kind of travel — brace yourself for interdimensional exploration as Ti’bi travels between realms in order to rescue his beloved’s soul.<br></li><li> <strong>You’ve Got a Friend in Me</strong><br>Make friends as you travel between dimensions, and use their helpful skills and resources to overcome the obstacles you’ll encounter on your journey, but be careful — not every soul has good intentions!<br></li><li> <strong>Blast From the Past</strong><br>As you venture out on your journey both into the Shadow World and the world of the living, you’ll discover secrets of the land and the ancient ones that dwell there.
