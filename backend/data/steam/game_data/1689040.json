    "description": "Welcome to Wardenia Adventurer! Try the Demo version of the first two areas of the anticipated Action RPG The Last Oricru - Final Cut. The Last Oricru - Final Cut brings you in a fantastic Sci-Fi Medieval world where you’ll find different ways how to approach things. Side with the different faction – or betray them. In this game there is no right or wrong, just YOUR way. Depending on your choices the story will unfold and develop according to your action – create your own story.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAre you a fan of tough and skill based combat, or are you rather looking into discovering the world with a bigger focus on exploring – The Last Oricu - Final Cut offers you both. Kill, die, cast magic attacks, grind, upgrade your gear, fight in mass battles, challenge tough bosses and find yourself confronted with tough decisions. Loot your enemies and level up – both in single player or local split screen co-op.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrepare for the Ratvolution!",
