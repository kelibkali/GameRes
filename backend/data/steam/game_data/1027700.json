    "description": "Price : 2.99 USD<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShmup Moments is a shoot-'em-up game that's easy to pick up and play.<br />\r\nWith arcade-like gameplay, slick controls and sound, hot beats and lighting, and a classic bullet hell ambience, it's the perfect game to chill out with when you need a break from AAA titles, or to meditate with before going to bed.<br />\r\nEnter the super slow motion zone that will allow you to artistically dodge even the most ridiculous barrages of bullets, and master advanced techniques like the shotgun dash!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShooting game guru or not, you're sure to have a blast.<br />\r\nPlay through all five stages in order in Arcade Mode, or skip cleared stages and start from your favorite level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nControls consist of movement and three attacks: shotgun, homing missile, and super slow mode.<br />\r\nThe shotgun packs a punch, but will knock you back. Use this knockback to your advantage, though, and you'll be able to evade at ultra-high speeds (the &quot;shotgun dash&quot;)!<br />\r\nHoming missiles aren't as strong, but can be fired infinitely.<br />\r\nThere's also super slow mode, but watch out: your score will decrease while it's activated!<br />\r\nExpert players should challenge themselves to play without it!",
