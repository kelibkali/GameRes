Having artists for parents, who read us vivid fantasy stories at bedtime, I developed an obsessive appreciation for fairy tales, woods and magical kingdoms.  Because of this, nature, as well as fantasy has been a prominent influence on my work.<br>Having been born with synesthesia, it did not take long for me to discover that all things of visual beauty can be described through sound.  I got my first keyboard when I was 8, and taught myself how to play.  By the time I was 14, I had composed nearly 100 original pieces, in an attempt to communicate my passion through music.<br><br>Although my goal in music has always been to capture, recapture and convey the wonder I felt as a child, while exploring woods and gardens, the single most influential thing in my life as a composer has been video game music.  This medium has been an endless source of delight for me, as the soundtracks underscoring the many electronic worlds I have explored over the years have demonstrated to me that I am by no means alone in my desire: I long to share with others the joys of discovery, epic sensations of wonder and enchantment as well as the sweetness and beauty of unique aesthetics, environments and themes by painting colorful and fantastical landscapes in sound.<br><br>I would say that the vast majority of my work (now over 1500 songs and counting) convey emotions existing on the “enchantment” spectrum.  My work is often dreamy, ethereal, soft, soothing, mysterious, meandering and (usually, but not always) joyful.  However, as seen in my BFS (Blob From Space) tracks, I like to sometimes write weird and fun, retro style video game music.  It’s my hope to write many video game soundtracks, because it's my hope that my dreams will live on through my music- but I won't stop creating it any time soon.  I will compose until I die!&quot;<br><br><strong>Otus Hobst</strong><br><i>About</i><br><br>Otus is a freelance composer / producer with over than 12 years of musical experience and classical training in the field.
