    "description": "ENDURE is a randomly generated psychological horror experience, focusing on individual phobias to create the most terrifying experience possible. Leaving you to figure out the mystery of &quot;The Gateway Apartments&quot; with the increasing number of disappearances and strange occurrences that have taken place within its walls. Use the tools at hand to try and map out the procedurally generated levels, to avoid being lost to the ever expanding maze. Discover hidden mysteries as you venture deeper into the building. Be careful, there maybe more than just stories lurking the hallways.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSurvive<br />\r\n- ENDURE is completely randomly generated, meaning each time you start a new game it will be completely different from the last, changing the way the story is delivered and the way you experience the game.<br />\r\n- Explore the halls of &quot;The Gateway Apartments&quot; and uncover the horrors that have been buried within its walls. Choose how you want to play, break into apartments and risk being heard, or play it safe and stealthy.",
