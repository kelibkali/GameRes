    "description": "With <strong>980</strong>, we are starting a new type of puzzle collection - a <strong>Black &amp; White</strong> series of photos that are different from what you'd usually expect. It is, of course, free for all owners of the game. We really hope you'll like this new type of challenge and enjoy <strong>Masters of Puzzle</strong> in a slightly different way.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1414330/extras/800fc549d1ee22737fc8241363db3927.avif?t=1600359137\" width=616 height=79 /></span><br>Contains <i>one</i> new puzzle box for Masters of Puzzle playable in variations of <i>250</i>, <i>500</i>, <i>750</i>, and <i>1000</i> puzzle tiles. The puzzle was created from the original digital photo with applied additional filters and effects. The image is rather unusual and might be difficult to assemble especially in larger tilesets. It will provide a nice challenge for both beginners and veterans alike.",
