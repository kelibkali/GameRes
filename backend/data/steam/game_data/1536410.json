    "description": "Design increasingly complex computation units powered by high pressure steam. Each unit has four ports with a desired function. There are only three base components. The steam generator and the switch and pipes to connect them. Using these, the game guides you through creating increasingly complex composite components. Each solved challenge yields another useful element that can be used in future designs. Poor solutions in previous stages make poor components to use further on, so you will end up coming back to old designs, tuning and optimising them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Game</h2>The following is a quick walkthrough the game dynamics.<br>It all starts with pipes. Left click to start a pipe and click each time to extend it in the direction of the mouse pointer.
