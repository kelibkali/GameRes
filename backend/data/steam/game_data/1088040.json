    "description": "Do you think you know the fight game? Welcome to <strong>MMA Executive</strong>, where styles make fights, and where brute force meets technical precision. You will need to build a powerful gym filled with the best prospects, experienced veterans and inspirational coaches to establish your reputation and make shrewd decisions for the survival of your gym and perhaps even the MMA world economy at large! Money talks, but so does reputation and skill! So do controversial judges decisions and doctor stoppages! As do bone crunching strikes and ligament snapping submissions! The MMA world is faithfully simulated here with hundreds of deeply researched and tested techniques, retirements, pound for pound rankings, a Hall of Fame system and a dynamic simulated fan-driven economy that responds to fighter performances. Compete against rival managers and buy-out million or even billion $ organizations (if you think you’ve got what it takes)! Set multiple training camps, allocate coaches, game-plans and track the technical progress of your fighters! Test fighters to break gym records, hire sponsors, build up your gym from scratch and fill up your trophy cabinet! We do it old-school here! Elbows, flying knees, stomps, kicks to the grounded opponent, huge throws, axe-kicks, cartwheel passes, coma-inducing chokes and, of course, the glamorous ring card girls. Care to join in the fun?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1088040/extras/587380b2c9ad8074e32eaa1f04602eab.poster.avif?t=1567088087\" width=300 height=168 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1088040/extras/587380b2c9ad8074e32eaa1f04602eab.webm?t=1567088087\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1088040/extras/587380b2c9ad8074e32eaa1f04602eab.mp4?t=1567088087\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1088040/extras/32272dcfe46b0dcf1c35dda8979dec66.poster.avif?t=1567088087\" width=300 height=168 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1088040/extras/32272dcfe46b0dcf1c35dda8979dec66.webm?t=1567088087\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1088040/extras/32272dcfe46b0dcf1c35dda8979dec66.mp4?t=1567088087\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><u>FEATURES:</u></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tUnlockable technical archive featuring annotated, battle-tested techniques to improve your real life fight IQ.
