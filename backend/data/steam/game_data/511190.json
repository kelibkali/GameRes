Yes, we did it. <br><br>You are fighting against restless ghosts and liches. They revolt, because too many graves are dug in the graveyard, whose keeper is you. Your purpose is to re-kill the undead! Your only friends are mushrooms, those you use to make mushroom bombs.<br><br><strong>Gameplay</strong><br>Your ammo is elemental mushrooms, there are 5 different elements of mushrooms those you collect from the ground. You create bombs with those elemental mushrooms (2 Fire, 1 Water, for example) using number keys 1 to 5. Your enemies also have elements; enemy’s element and the elements of your mushroom-bomb determine the damage you deal. For example, you deal more damage to a Fire ghost if you prepare a bomb with Water mushrooms.<br><br>There are 2 types of enemies: Normal ghosts and liches. Normal ghosts are melee attackers, they use claws. Whereas, liches throw you stones and they are much stronger than normal ghosts.<br><br>We have 2 game modes: Waved and Survival. You fight against 10 waves of enemies in the first. Survival lasts as long as you are alive.<br><br>There are 4 power-ups: Slow Time, Shield, Mushroom Magnet and Infinite Mushrooms.",
