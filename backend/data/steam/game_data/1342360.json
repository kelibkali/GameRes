Eons later, our ancestors knew what had to be done, a peace treaty it was, with 100 seals to separate all blood from each, to never start a war ever again. One day, all the seals have gone broken and lost. and the world is on the verge of a new war, all are pointing fingers at each other for what has happened to those seals. A mercenary corporation has developed a new bio-energy force to genetically enhance their troops. A fine set of super soldiers are trained to retrieve the lost seals before it’s too late, but such a task cannot be assigned but to the very few elites since the top-class soldier training is extremely costly as well as time-consuming. A 5 S-Class soldier is tasked with retrieving all 100 seals, 20 each, you get to play as one of them to retrieve the only hope left to keep this world intact. As you progress through the course of the game, you get to unravel the history of the character you're playing. Many mysteries and secrets waiting to unfold.",
