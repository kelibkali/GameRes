In a psychedelic starway filled with aliens, treasure, heroes and all sorts of fluffy friends, our hero will valiantly clash, jump and roll, with the choice to either avoid incoming danger, or dutifully bring on justice by laser gun. Will you help Shooti survive in this crazy scrolling highway of oncoming traffic, space debris and technicolor lunacy? We wish you the best luck on your voyage thru the stars!<br><br>This is the DemoScene edition of <i>RetroShooti</i>, a space dreams shoot 'em up game by all-purpose artist and game designer Kid MarsCat☆, featuring the first Act from the game, 5 bosses, and partial access to many of the features that are available in the full game. It includes some of the songs from Lucca's chiptunes soundtrack, and many of the small creatures and evil foes that will appear on the full release.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1391460/extras/c939f38e69ceb1cfe9095355f3d09980.webp?t=1611387174\" width=610 height=32 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 13 levels (40 in the final game!)<br></li><li> 5 bosses (16 in the final game!)<br></li><li> 16 power-ups, a dozen different enemies (72 in the final game), and so much more!<br></li><li> Local multiplayer with up to four players, in both Co-op and Vs. mode!<br></li><li> More than a dozen songs from the full soundtrack for the game + in-game music player!<br></li><li> Partial access to many of the unlockables and trinkets available in the full game!<br></li><li> Partial access to many of the additional game modes and challenges from the full game!<br></li><li> Many of the hats and colors for player customization that will be appearing in the full game!<br></li><li> Too much more ridiculousness to even be able to list here!</li></ul>",
