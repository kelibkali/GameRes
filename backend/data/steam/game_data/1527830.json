I've only recently figured out what I need to let go of. Through a journey of self discovery and being able to make this game I can say that I’m now the happiest I’ve ever been.<br><br>Gate to Site 8 was made with the intent that others who have had similar experiences, and struggled to find their purpose afterwards, can reflect on their past and think about what effect those traumas still have today.<br><br>Though Gate to Site 8 is somewhat dark and metaphorical, I hope it helps you in some way. I hope you can find a reason for why you feel the way you do and that it gets easier to live a happier, healthier life.<br><br><i>I love you, and I forgive you...</i>",
