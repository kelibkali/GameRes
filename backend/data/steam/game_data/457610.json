    "description": "It seems everyone is running late this morning and in order for you to avoid more delays you’ll want to do the best job possible shunting several coal cars, car carriers and cement hoppers around TYNE the massive rail yard just outside Newcastle station.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis detailed session is driven by full audio and cinematic cameras to immerse you in a full shunting experience. Hear each driver as they approach with their cars to have you shunt them to the required locations. Each with their own personality so you’ll want to stay on schedule otherwise you’ll have a few of them make some complaints to the dispatcher!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\nFull scripted shunting session with cut-scenes and audio task details and commentary.",
