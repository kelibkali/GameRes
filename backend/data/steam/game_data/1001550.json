    "description": "In Orbit is an interactive virtual reality experience made with data from NASA's Earth Science satellites. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat if you could step inside the unseen phenomena of our planet? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat if your curiosity could transform the world around you? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Orbit transforms data collected by NASA’s “Eyes on Earth”—the satellites relaying information about our climate, oceans, and soil from thousands of miles above our heads—into a multisensory, interactive experience that celebrates the marvelous complexities of our planet and our drive to unravel them. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy creating a delightful way for everyone to have a dialogue with earth science data, In Orbit hopes to provoke a renewed curiosity about our planet, a passion for its infinite wonders, and a deeper connection to the only home we have. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Orbit is a collaboration between MAP Design Lab and Microsoft, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, The Huntington Library, and Composer Shane Myrbeck.",
