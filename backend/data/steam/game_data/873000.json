    "description": "An arcade shooter where teamwork is key. Stuck Together is a 2 player co-op game where 2 players each control one half of a character and work together to defeat waves of enemies, unlock new guns and expand the map. One player controls the torso while the other controls the legs each with their own responsibilities. Using the torso, your focus is to use the guns and shoot the enemies while the legs are more concerned with navigation and evasion. Only by getting Stuck Together can you truly work as a team and defeat the waves of enemies out to get you. As you succeed with each wave you can spend rewards to unlock new guns and new areas in the map which will help you in your battle.<br><br>Global world ending pandemic got you down? Stuck inside your home unable to see your friends? Not to worry! Because even if you and little Jimmy can't see each other in person... You can still be STUCK TOGETHER.<br><br>Results may vary, digital pine studios cannot be held responsible for the death of Jimmy and his inability to play with you.<br><br><i>Friends sold separately</i>",
