    "description": "The design brief for this game was quite simple: 'Create the most advanced strategy game yet seen on a home computer'.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe scenario was unimportant - game play was all that mattered, the computer opponent had to be the most intelligent. <br />\r\nThe controls: Total simplicity.<br />\r\nThe players learning curve: Steep.<br />\r\nAddiction factor: High.<br />\r\nVisual appeal: Vital.<br />\r\nPossible strategies: Endless<br />\r\nThe result: FINAL FRONTIER.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQuick to learn but hard to master, FINAL FRONTIER is a fast, full icon operated 1 player vs computer strategy simulation not unlike a real time chess game where the player can design his own pieces and structure his own moves.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA game of infinite permutations, FINAL FRONTIER takes game play to the limits.",
