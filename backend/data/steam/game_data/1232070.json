    "description": "The Studio Polygon 400MMC is based on Alexander Dennis Enviro 400MMCs in the real-world. The Enviro 400MMC is a low-floor double decker introduced by Alexander Dennis in 2014. Our rendition of this includes various variants offered in the real-world, tonnes of customisability options to match and unique realistic systems to match exact behaviour found in the real bus.<br><br>Version 1.2 of the 400MMC further improves the experience of the 400MMC with a re-worked model, new customisability options, 200+ new sounds, improved texturing, and a huge improvement on performance. With these changes, it makes the 400MMC experience better than you’ve ever had before allowing you to enjoy driving a double decker round the streets of OMSI 2.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1232070/extras/1a793997ff716d4975eae772eaa367ae.avif?t=1646145385\" width=616 height=68 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A whopping 23 variants - 16 ADL variants, and 7 Scania variants<br></li><li>7 low height variants<br></li><li>5 dual door variants<br></li><li>1 London spec dual door variants<br></li><li>Lots of customisability options including seating options, mirror types, internal next stop displays, wheel accessories, engine stop/start and more!<br></li><li>Unique vehicle systems meticulously recreated to match real-world operation<br></li><li>High detail Hanover Displays simulation<br></li><li>Advanced Ticketer ticket machine recreated 1:1 with real-life, licensed by Ticketer themselves.<br></li><li>Immersive audio meticulously recreated from real-world counterparts<br></li><li>Custom handling scripts<br></li><li>Mirror screens option that replaces the traditional mirrors with cameras inside of the cab based off of ADL’s SmartVision technology.<br></li><li>and so much more!</li></ul>",
