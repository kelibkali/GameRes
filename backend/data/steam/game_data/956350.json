    "description": "There Is No Turning Back is a roguelike survival RNG that reveals your true nature as you face increasingly anxiety-provoking maps of monsters and darkness. Will you fight through the hordes of enemies, rescuing survivors along the way? Or will you quietly run alone, protecting your precious resources?  When the lights go out, and the monsters approach, it's too late to stop and turnaround. You must keep going. There is...no turning back. <br><br>After waking up in a world overrun by monsters you must decide what kind of survivor you are. With the choice to fight back or evade, you will endure dwindling resources and ever-persistent enemies. Exploration and rescuing helpless survivors can bring you great rewards, but puts your very life in danger. Each survivor you save unlocks a trainable ability you can unlock per character to help you survive deeper into the chaos, and a knowledgeable trainer can unlock up to 3 additional ability slots to aid you. Build defenses to help you escape while saving enough to keep you alive while you search for the next way out. But, in this uncertain world with mounting pressure from beasts and bad guys closing in, your best bet for survival is to study everyone's moves, learn from your mistakes, and keep going forward because...
