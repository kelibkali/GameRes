We will continue to maintain servers until they sunset on April 6th 2025. We greatly appreciate the community support we have been blessed enough to receive over the years and continue to receive.  For more information on planned farewell celebrations please visit our community forums page.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Thank you,</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >OrbusVR Development Team</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >OrbusVR is a fantasy MMORPG designed for virtual reality. Explore the colorful open world of Patreayl as you make it safe again for humanity to venture forth from behind the walls of Highsteppe.

Meet the residents of a quaint mushroom village and try your hand catching moonflies. Defend a patrol outpost overrun by spiders. And finally find your way through a maze of insect-infested tunnels deep underground in search of a sacred object…</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Mini Story Pack #1: Secrets of Mugwood features all-new zones, NPCs, and a new questline to follow. Unlock more than 10 hours of brand new content for just $9.99 by visiting the in-game shop today!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Try Before You Buy</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The OrbusVR Demo will allow you to create a character and play for free until Level 10 on all eight classes. Once you've decided to purchase the game, you'll be able to start right where you left off with the demo restrictions removed so you can continue your journey! (Note that demo accounts cannot trade with other players or use the Auction House in-game).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Buy Once, Play Forever</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >OrbusVR does not have a required monthly subscription fee! Once you've bought the game, you are able to play it as much as you'd like without paying us another dime. We don't have any &quot;Pay 2 Win&quot; in-app purchases or loot boxes, either. Ongoing revenue is provided via an in-game shop with items such as mounts and cosmetic pets for sale, as well as through Mini Story Packs (DLCs) that will cost an additional fee to unlock new content.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Combat</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The combat of OrbusVR has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of room-scale VR. That means instead of just mashing buttons on an ability bar, you actually have to hone your physical skill to become more effective at combat.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >For example, there's no tab-targetting for Rangers, who have to actually aim and hit targets with their bow. And for the Runemage, your ablity to cast spells is determined by how quickly and precisely you can draw the ancient symbols of runespeak. Whether you're looking for an up-close-and-personal, physically demanding melee role, or a more planned-out approach to combat via the musketeer's orbs, you'll find that combat in OrbusVR is unlike any other MMO you've ever played.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Relax</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >When you're ready to put down your sword for the day, you've got some great options available to kick back and relax. Fishing is a great way to pass the time and earn a little dram while you're at it. Or spend time with your pet dragon and put them through the paces at one of the many dragon racing courses throughout the world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >When you finish with that, head to your Player House  – customizable to your personal style with furniture and decor  – to craft a potion or tinker with blueprints and resources to create your own tools and furniture. Feeling social instead? Head to the Highsteppe Tavern to catch up with fellow adventurers. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>VR Support From the Beginning</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >OrbusVR has been designed from the ground-up for desktop VR systems. As such we have full support for 180-degree (front facing) and 360-degree tracking setups. We've also got all kinds of great options for locomotion, including Teleport and Sliding, as well as the ability to customize your forward direction, smooth and snap turning, and even dual-joystick support for strafe/move and turn at the same time!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Note that for the absolute best experience, we do recommend a 360-degree tracking setup.</p>",
