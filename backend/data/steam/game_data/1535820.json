And then take that enormous boat and fill it with every kind of cannon, laser beam, and whatever the hell else you can find.   You can also collect comic book panels which can provide a variety of buffs to your ship.  Ah, and don't forget about melee weapons.  Every boat worth piloting needs some buzz saws, or at least some electrified spikes.<br><br><br><strong>FIGHT!</strong><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1535820/extras/2b0168924ad78640fd9a877daa53004c.poster.avif?t=1629475358\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1535820/extras/2b0168924ad78640fd9a877daa53004c.webm?t=1629475358\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1535820/extras/2b0168924ad78640fd9a877daa53004c.mp4?t=1629475358\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Use your fire power and maneuvering skills to sink ships, robots, and other stuff.
