    "description": "<strong>Conga Combat</strong> is not a typical arena-shooter. Defend yourself against the pan-dimensional critters using your bullet tail, close enemy portals by looping around them and charge up your hyper-destructive mega-lazor by laying a path of bullets in front of the mindless, drifting purploids. Oh, and stay the hell out of the way of the EVIL X - those dudes are BAD news!<br><br>Combining trippy visual effects and coffee-break sized bytes of hardcore action, <strong>Conga Combat</strong> can be played solo in either arcade or survival mode. Arcade plays like a typical coin-op, with the player starting from the beginning each game, jumping from dimension to dimension by achieving the ever-growing kill-quota on each stage. Alternatively, the 'pure' survival mode sees the player facing an endless horde of increasingly aggressive geometric critters in a single arena for as long as they can.<br><br>Got some people over for a gaming session?
