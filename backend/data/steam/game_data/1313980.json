It is a country on the brink of revolution. <br><br>Attend parties, mingle with the rich and powerful, learn their secrets, and use this to get the wealth and power you deserve. Find true love in an opulent world of ever-shifting alliances, that grows more dangerous by the day. <br><br>Still, you must always keep your eye on the coming revolution.
