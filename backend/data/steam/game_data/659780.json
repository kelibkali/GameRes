What was once peaceful, and quite, became a breeding ground to all that was evil in this world. An explosion from a distant mountain, almost visible to all, changed everything. At first they thought it was a volcanic eruption. But eruptions like those, never caused the wildlife of the land to turn evil. While others took refuge, some suffered an unfortunate fate. No one was the same after that day. Family's were torn apart and villages were burnt to the ground.<br>Legend broke loose of a chosen one. A creature immune to the essence who was said to have the capability, to save the world.<br>Now you must fight off against the darkness, being the only immunity left. With only the help of your tiny friend, embark on an epic journey to save the planet you once called home. Whether you're taking down giants, or fighting off against effected wildlife, you must make it to the top of the mountain, and restore peace to these lands.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What you're up against</h2>You'll be fighting creatures you've never seen before, whether its a sliding Slime, or a jumping Spickle. Upgrade your character, equip him with the best abilities, and edit his stats to make yourself unbeatable against the hordes of creatures you'll be up against. Solve puzzles and complete missions left and right while you reconquer this extensive land in front of you. Find abilities you'd never discovered before, gain an upper hand against your enemies, and meet new friends along the way! This world is your's for the taking in this amazing RPG experience you'll be left asking for more!",
