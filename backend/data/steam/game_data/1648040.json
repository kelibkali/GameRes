    "description": "There You Are is an exploratory narrative game that features stop-motion-inspired graphic design and two endings from the player's choices and actions. In this game, the player will role-play the girl, Su, to deal with her father's relationship to move away from the past and accept the loss of her mom. While many games already touch on this type of topic to a certain extent, There You Are uses both storytelling methods and game design principles to exquisitely craft each story beat and depict an emotional bittersweet story.<br><br><strong>What is this?</strong><br>An exploratory narrative game about grief<br>Features stop-motion inspired graphic design<br>Two endings from your choices and actions<br><br><strong>What am I supposed to do?</strong><br>You will role-play the girl, Su, <br>to deal with her life and get away from the past.<br><br><strong>How to play?</strong><br>Mouse to move the camera<br>WASD/Arrow key to move the character<br>Left mouse button to interact<br><br><strong>Your comments!</strong><br>Leave us your thoughts to help us polish this game!",
