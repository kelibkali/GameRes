    "description": "Robot wants stuff, so go get it for him! This game is a compilation of the original Robot Wants games from 2010: <strong>Robot Wants Kitty, Robot Wants Puppy, Robot Wants Fishy</strong>, and <strong>Robot Wants Ice Cream</strong>. In addition, it includes <strong>Robot Wants Y!?</strong>, a mini-game that was actually the main banner on the JayIsGames website for a while. And of course, Robot wouldn't be wanting it all if we didn't add <strong>Robot Wants Justice</strong>, a <i>brand new</i> Robot adventure!<br><br><strong>Robot Wants</strong> pioneered the &quot;mini-metroidvania&quot; concept - an adventure you play through over an hour or less, collecting the powerups you need to go from zero to Kitty along the way. And all with a clock ticking - speedruns are the goal!<br><br>Each of the included games includes 2 alternate maps (an &quot;Easy&quot; map, which sometimes is not so easy, but we guarantee it is short! And a &quot;Remix&quot; map, which is never easy, or quick), and there are also 12 Mutators which allow you to transform the way the game plays in a variety of helpful and horrible ways.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Online high scores to compete with your friends - each unique combination of mutators has a separate high score table, so try to be the best at your specialty.<br></li><li> The ultimate Metroidvania action - you can't even <i>JUMP</i> without first finding a power-up in some of these games.<br></li><li> A massive shop full of features and game modes to unlock as you play (with space money, not real money. No IAP or DLC here)<br></li><li> Extreme alien blasting in <strong>Robot Wants Kitty</strong><br></li><li> Intense kitty-hurling action in <strong>Robot Wants Puppy</strong><br></li><li> Psychotic mad bombing in <strong>Robot Wants Fishy</strong><br></li><li> A unique combination of Metroidvania and RPG in <strong>Robot Wants Ice Cream</strong><br></li><li> Serious puzzle-solving action in <strong>Robot Wants Y?!</strong><br></li><li> Alien-smashing, air-dashing combos in <strong>Robot Wants Justice</strong></li></ul>",
