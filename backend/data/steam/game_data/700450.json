    "description": "Welcome to Silentium 2D, a local, sharedscreen game which pits you and a friend (soon to be enemy) against eachother in 1v1 arcade combat!<br />\r\nFight your foe in the city, the field, or even the freakin' moon! (Yes, the moon!). Take on hordes of robots in the solo 'Chaos' mode.<br />\r\nInspired by various arcade games, Silentium 2D was a hobby project designed to let younger audiences get their hands on a keyboard and quickly learn the intuitive controls. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBest of all, it's affordable, fun, and can be played offline with a friend! Silentium 2D also supports Steam Remote Play. The controls are remarkably easy to use, and allows for anyone to play! By purchasing Silentium 2D, you support Frentwick Indie in making future titles!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe hope to see you on the virtual battlefield ;)",
