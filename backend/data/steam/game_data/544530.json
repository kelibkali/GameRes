Turn off the lights, light a few candles, say her name three times into a mirror and you might see her on the other side. <i>Escape Bloody Mary</i> takes you through the worst possible scenario of the childhood ritual. Prepare for an immersive horror experience which transforms your typical bathroom into an unsettling and stressful haunted environment with no way out. Can you find a way out before Bloody Mary claims your soul?<br><br>Gameplay offers a series of puzzles under pressure which are designed to force the user to balance strategy and survival.",
