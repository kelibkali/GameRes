    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Vice Versa</strong> is a minimalist yet deeply strategic card-stacking challenge where every choice tightens the tension. Play solo or cooperate online with up to 5 players as you battle through two sides, an ascending side and a descending side, trying to place your entire deck before you run out of legal moves. One mistake, one unlucky hand, or one hesitation can end the run.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Two Modes. Two Mindsets. One Goal: Survive the Deck.</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Colors Mode</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A clean, approachable ruleset that quickly becomes a razor-sharp puzzle.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You will work with cards numbered 1 through 10 across four colors, placing them onto rising and falling stacks. The twist is that matching colors reset the stack, allowing you to bend the numbering rules and keep the run alive.</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Each player holds 2 cards, or 4 cards in solo play</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You must play at least 1 card each turn</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Smart resets are your lifeline</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Every decision impacts everyone</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Colors is fast to learn and hard to master.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Tens Mode - <strong><u>Not Included In Demo</u></strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A more demanding mode designed for players who want deeper coordination.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You are now juggling 100 cards, 4 stacks, and a reset rule based on jumping exactly ten numbers up or down. These jumps allow dramatic reversals that can rescue the group or open new traps.</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Each player holds 4 cards</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You must play at least 2 cards each turn</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The mode features 2 ascending stacks and 2 descending stacks</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Precision planning becomes critical</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Tens rewards bold plays, calculated gambles, and communication under pressure.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A Cooperative Nail-Biter</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Whether playing alone or with friends, <strong>Vice Versa</strong> delivers a constant push and pull between survival and collapse. You will celebrate perfect resets, yell at unlucky draws, and fight to empty the final hand before the deck defeats you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Simple rules. Deceptive depth.
