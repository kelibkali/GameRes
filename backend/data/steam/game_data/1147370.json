    "description": "The Empire founded by Humanity's greatest hero and sanctioned by the God of Order himself is on the cusp of its worst time of hardship in almost 300 years of history. You play as a previously unknown mercenary who, after being caught up in the Empire's time of chaos and misery, may be capable of growing strong enough to close the book on these trying times... or write the next chapter himself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Empire's Crisis is an RPG Maker game that offers:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* 12-20 hours of runtime<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* A character-driven story closely tied to the history and mythology of the world<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* A main quest that takes the player and their party to the corners of the known world, and back again<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Side quests featuring the main Guilds of the land to explore certain regions in more depth<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Character progression beyond leveling up, in branching class promotions that make each playthrough a little different<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* 2 different endings, each of which dramatically changes the course of history",
