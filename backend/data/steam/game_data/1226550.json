Far stretches of the ruined land are ruled by self-acclaimed warlords and bandits that roam the roads with their diesel-fueled war machines, delivering the cruelty to anyone that dares to enter their domain. In all of this madness, pockets of a new civilization start to shimmer. That’s where you come in. As a member of the Badland Envoy’s, and elite guild of skilled drivers, you’ll be tasked with leading the expeditions between towns and newly created settlements, establishing safe routs, protecting the cargo, and eliminating any encountered threat. You’ll be a messenger, a porter, a warrior, and most of all, a new hope for those that try to rebuild humanity.<br><br>Do you have what it takes?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1226550/extras/2b4c4a0ad0e9d24acd97c813d6410af4.poster.avif?t=1620811489\" width=616 height=120 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1226550/extras/2b4c4a0ad0e9d24acd97c813d6410af4.webm?t=1620811489\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1226550/extras/2b4c4a0ad0e9d24acd97c813d6410af4.mp4?t=1620811489\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>If you’re get stopped out there, you’ll die. Think fast, drive faster, react instantly. Remember, it’s not always about the speed of your car – sometimes it’s about the speed of your trigger.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1226550/extras/e1a9d7fa45eec942e3c1bab1c4e6b983.avif?t=1620811489\" width=616 height=120 /></span><br>Spending some of that hard-earned buck on your rides is always a good idea. Installing new armor plating, homing missiles launcher or a high tech nitro system can make a difference between life and death out there on the road. Be good to your chariots and they’ll repay you with the same.

Good. You can trust them to have your back, but when things get really tough, don’t hesitate to give them commands from a more tactical point of view.
