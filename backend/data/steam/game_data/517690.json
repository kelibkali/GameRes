    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What is Sparkour?</h2>Sparkour is a game all about speed, agility, and on-the-fly strategy. Use your sick parkour tricks and various power-ups to speed into victory! Against your friends, bots, or strangers, use traps, projectiles and more to stop them in their tracks. Or, chain together multiple, stylish skills to build up speed and boost right through them.<br><br><br>Use these skills together and become the ultimate human projectile, in the most intense, stylistic, and frienemy-forming battle you've ever seen.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What In The Demo?</h2>Thanks for checking out our alpha demo! This is a short little snippet of what to expect in the final game. As stated in the title, this is a late Alpha version of the game, so expect some bugs and unfinished edges here and there. Because we're a small team, we'd really appreciate your feedback, so we've integrated a feedback feature in the game for you to give us some details about how the game feels for you.<br><br>For more information about the full game, keep up to date on the going-ons on our fairly-monthly update posts on the Steam community!",
