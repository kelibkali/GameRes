    "description": "Save these dinguses from themselves! You play as one of them and are (hopefully) not quite as dumb as they are. Run around and grab objects to place for the Nummels to use, so they can find their way without suffering some terrible fate!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNummels may be dumb, but they're predictable. When they see a ladder, they will always climb it. If they find some gum on the ground, they'll stop and chew it. If they fall in the water, they will stop breathing. It's up to you to move things around so that your litter of Nummels can make it through each level to the exit. On most levels you can take your time and set everything up before letting them loose, but to get good scores and unlock all the things, you'll need to go fast. Each level has a leaderboard that's scored based on saving all the Nummels the fastest. A few Nummels may have been harmed during the production of this game.",
