    "description": "On January 1st, I challenged myself to design, develop, and publish a complete game in 1 month. This is that game.<br><br>The original idea was to tell a somewhat cliche RPG story with one critical change: You play as the monsters.<br><br>Ozymandias is an imp living in the valley near Detritiville. He's a scavenger; searching caves and battlefields for loot and equipment that he can sell and buy supplies, but when he finds an old book with a powerful aura, he is drawn into a quest that spans the continent to uncover the mystery of the book's origins.<br><br>I know it's nothing spectacular and it uses mostly premade assets, but hopefully it makes up for that with solid map design and writing.<br><br>Thank you for coming on this journey with me.<br><br>Features:<br>Approx. 8-10 hours of dungeon-crawling adventure.<br>Fun and creative story with deep lore and interesting characters.<br>No lootboxes.<br>No pay-to-win BS.<br>3 different endings.<br><br><u><strong>Controls quick guide:</strong></u><br><br><u>Z, Space, Enter</u> - <strong>Confirm</strong>, select actions, talk to people, interact with objects<br><u>X, Esc</u> - <strong>Cancel commands</strong>, back out of options, open the menu<br><u>Q/W</u> - Quick switch through characters on equip/status screen<br><u>Shift</u> - makes the character dash, except on the overworld map<br><u>Arrow Keys</u> - Move<br><u>Alt+Enter</u> - Full Screen",
