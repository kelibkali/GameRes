    "description": "The next generation of Chicken attacks!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRedneck Kentucky and the Next Generation Chickens will introduce into the world of cartoony humor and intense action, giving you an exceptional replayability factor. Players have a great array of weapons at their disposal, they can also collect eggs which are located on the maps and activate special bonuses. The UNREAL engine ensures outstanding audio and visual effects, KARMA provides realistic physics model, whereas the SPEEDTREE technology is responsible for the high quality of animated foliage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Clucking little monsters are hard to catch – you will have to do some serious running around.<br />\r\n- Chickens are no pacifists, either. Mind the dangerous flying potatoes.<br />\r\n- Quick selection of the shooting position, a peer through the scope and precise head-shot right in the feathery head will do just fine!<br />\r\n- Can you imagine a better bonus than depriving the ugly chick of their eggs?",
