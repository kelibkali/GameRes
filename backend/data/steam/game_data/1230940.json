You take on the role of the titular Ant Detective in this prequel to learn Kowalski's true backstory...or maybe this game is a sequel where he didn't really die and just got a stomach cramp. We're not sure yet. Either way if you wishlist it we will make sure mother provides another wacky (and much longer!) adventure for Kowalski to ass about in.<br><br>Ant Detective is a third person detective noir game with a comedy twist - you're an ant, as is everyone else. Figure out who did the crime, and hope you can make them to do the time. If not you can always fall back to shooting them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Branching crime investigation: collect ant-clues, interview witness-ants, anty-thing a real detective would do!<br></li><li>Hyper-realistic gunplay: your gun fires bullets when you pull the trigger.<br></li><li>Satirical fully voice acted story; can two guys voice fifty ants?
