    "description": "The game is set in the alternate future of 9108. Québec City is celebrating its 7500th anniversary. The overpopulated metropolis of 900 millions inhabitants lives an idyllic, eccentric, but at the same time, dystopian lifestyle. Peace is about to end, though, as aliens, called the Tibestians, are now getting ready to wipe us out. <br><br>In this satirical and over-the-top action-RPG inspired from various 8-bit and 16-bit action and adventure games, you play the role of a reprogrammed Tibestian robot who is now friendly (although scary for locals) who has to go defeat his master, who has setup a robot-building factory North of the Harlaka District and is now threatening the human race. This game was made using RPG Maker 2003 and uses EasyRPG Player to run.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1089080/extras/6a414b100eb000f7671c3b4b02f09b73.avif?t=1771123483\" width=514 height=1349 /></span>",
