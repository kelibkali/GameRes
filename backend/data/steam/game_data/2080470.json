It doesn't come with a white paper, it wasn't built by scientists, and it certainly doesn't benefit society. It is however, hilarious.<br><br>That's right, we trained an AI to be funny and made it into a party game.<br><br>Turing Quest pits you and your friends against our humorous AI to write jokes. Players get to vote on if your joke or an AI generated response was better. It's a chaotic, edgy, and hilarious experience for up to 6 players. Up to 50 additional people can join in to participate in the voting rounds using our new audience feature.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >How It Works</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Start the game and display on a TV, a large monitor, or screen share for remote play with Discord / Zoom / Steam Broadcast or similar service.<br></li><li> Players connect to the game using their phone's web browser at .<br></li><li> Each player constructs a question which someone else will have to answer.<br></li><li> Everyone writes funny answers to each other's questions.<br></li><li> Answers are mixed with AI responses.<br></li><li> Players get to vote for their favorite responses to decide who's funnier: you or the AI.</li></ul><br>Get ready to test your sense of humor against our completely unhinged AI.",
