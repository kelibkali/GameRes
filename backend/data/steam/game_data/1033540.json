(Formerly known as Astaria)</u></strong><br>Arvita is a hardcore fantasy MMORPG with emphasis on social communities, crafting, party combat, territory capture and player vs. developer (PvD). The game's hardcore aspects focus on difficulty, weight behind combat, item loss (on death or breaking), logistics (food, bandages, ammo, reagents, durability) and the inability to grow too powerful. The story is developed based on how players unfold major events or defeat cataclysmic bosses.<br><br><strong><u>Join our discord for updates!</u></strong><br>For updates, join the Arvita Discord on the right.<br><br><strong><u>Can I play right now?</u></strong><br>You can request access to the steam playtest for free! Once early access launches, you will need to purchase a copy of the game.<br><br><strong><u>Free Updates and Expansions</u></strong><br>Arvita content updates and expansions will never cost extra. The game's base price is all you need to play competitively.<br><br><strong><u>What is PvD?</u></strong><br>Player vs Developer is where every player teams up against the developers like they're the Dungeon Master of a board game. Developers will define the behavior and actions of monsters based on how players interact or react to different factions of the world. This system allows for a more living world in which player actions can affect the outcome of many factors within the game. The world will change based on the efforts of the players. For instance, a capital city may fall to the enemy if not properly defended during events and will only come back if players retake the city. These events are done both through automated systems and GM involvement!<br><br><strong><u>Party/Group Combat</u></strong><br>While you can still solo through some of the content, majority of the content is group based combat and designed for social gameplay in mind.<br><br><strong><u>Community Focus</u></strong><br>Astaria revolves around a community that will unite against the common enemy. The game's focus is the social aspect of working together as an entire server in order to keep the darkness at bay. Players must not only further themselves as a player, but also within the many communities that will form. Will you choose to be a merchant that sells wares to other players, a crafter who creates gear out of resources, a combative adventurer that specializes in banishing the darkness, or a leader that helps to unite players under a single banner? How you choose to interact with the other players is a key factor in victory against the Darkness.<br><br><strong><u>Crafting</u></strong><br>Crafting supplies and equipment is an important factor in keeping the players equipped. Crafting professions and resource gathering is a huge integral part in keeping groups of players battle ready and well supplied(potions, bandages, food). <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Armorsmithing<br></li><li>Weaponsmithing<br></li><li>Mining<br></li><li>Woodcraft<br></li><li>Leatherworking<br></li><li>Skinning<br></li><li>Culinary<br></li><li>First Aid<br></li><li>Many more planned to be added throughout early access.</li></ul><br><strong><u>Logistics</u></strong><br>Players will have to manually travel around with no fast travel. In addition to this, eat to keep your stamina up and use bandages in between fights as potions are very expensive and rare. This will create another dynamic for groups to watch the amount of supplies they take on their journeys. Weight, inventory space, and more are logistical factors that need to be considered.<br><br><strong><u>Liberation System and Curator System</u></strong><br>The Liberation system is what allows players and monsters to capture territory, which in turn changes the way certain areas can be interacted with. If players capture an area, monsters of the darkness will not spawn anymore in that area— allowing players to gather resources, to freely explore, and to build their crafting/trade skills. Certain areas will have unique resources allowing players to strategically plan out which area is more valuable to them, as different ones will provide different bonus resources, experience, questlines and more. The Curator is a system that controls the overall dynamic of how monsters roam the world or how many players are on at a given time. If there is enough players online, the monsters will be a lot more aggressive. If a certain amount of players are on, they will passively patrol their own areas.",
