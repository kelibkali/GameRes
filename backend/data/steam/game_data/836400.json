    "description": "This is a fun vr basketball game that currently has 5 maps, decent graphics, different song genres to choose from, graphics settings, awesome dunks, and much more! The current music genres are rock, pop, rap, country, dubstep, and happy. You can also choose graphics settings from very low to ultra. Both of those can be found in the settings section in the lobby! The maps include a normal basketball court, an anti-gravity court, the great crater, a bedroom, and BlockyBall. I am currently working on multiplayer and overhauling the maps. I am always trying to add new maps though. There are also timed tests that range from 1 minute to 20 minutes to test your ability at basketball! There are timers that can go infinitely unless you are in a test. There is always a scoreboard showing the timer and your total score!",
