    "description": "Bleak end is a hand-drawn poetic game about a girl lost in a suddenly faded reality. Immerge yourself in a depressive atmosphere that will confront you with futility and sorrow as you wander around through the entangled labyrinth. Paths that lead nowhere, confused thoughts, darkness reveal deep feelings of being lost and broken.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game focusing on conveying the emotions though the delicate art, evocative words and melancholic soundtrack.",
