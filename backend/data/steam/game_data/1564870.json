Feel how it is to be the first woman astronaut.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What Is Humanity?</h2><i>Humanity: First Woman in Space</i> transports you into the body of the first woman to go into space. View the world through the eyes of Astronaut Turova as she navigates through the male dominated world of astronaut training. Experience how it feels when most people around you don't believe in you.
