Before long, the real world begins to feel strangely foreign. The colors, sounds, and smells are no longer the same. With every passing day, the dream world seeps into the real one and soon, she might not be able to tell the difference...<strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >GAMEPLAY</h2></strong>Players will navigate the world as June and interact with her nightmares, people and objects. Puzzles will require a keen eye as they scale with the intensity of June's nightmares and delusions. Although the main story path will require casual effort, collectibles and secrets or hidden paths may not be obvious at first.<span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1568520/extras/0507573207f60a80257ca46accfa02ba.poster.avif?t=1747325762\" width=600 height=290 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1568520/extras/0507573207f60a80257ca46accfa02ba.webm?t=1747325762\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1568520/extras/0507573207f60a80257ca46accfa02ba.mp4?t=1747325762\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >FEATURES</h2></strong><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Dreamy 2.5D atmospheric horror experience</li><li>Immersive and mind-bending story</li><li>Beautifully gloomy low poly environments</li><li>Clever and interesting puzzles</li><li>Engaging collectibles and hidden secrets</li><li>Passionately developed by a one-girl team</li></ul>",
