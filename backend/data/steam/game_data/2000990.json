    "description": "<strong>PLEASE NOTE: This demo reflects an early alpha version of <i>The Lost Weld</i>. Please note that game play and other aspects of the game are continuing to change and improve as we continue to develop the game!</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Lost Weld</h2><br><i>The Lost Weld</i> is an exciting, fantasy-themed action-adventure game. The game features a compelling, movie-like script recorded by some of the industry’s top voice-acting talents, beautiful open world environments, and engaging game action. Set in a rich fairytale-like fantasy world filled with interesting characters and imaginative twists and turns, The Lost Weld's main storyline will eventually include about 6 to 8 hours of exciting game play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Plot</h2><br><strong>An elf-like princess must save her people by going on a magical adventure, overcoming obstacles and meeting strange creatures along the way.</strong><br><br>Princess Piper lives on the Isle of Mist where she and the other Mistians enjoy a happy way of life powered by the Weld, a magical resource first discovered hundreds of years ago. When the Weld mysteriously vanishes, Piper’s mother, Queen Astra, sets out to find a solution, but is soon captured by the stone-like Rookians in the mountains. <br><br>Piper, with the help of a new friend, begins an adventure to save her mother, but soon learns that the fate of the entire island depends on her traveling into strange lands deep below the Isle. To succeed, Piper must not only find out what happened to the Weld, but also must channel magical powers within herself. <br><br>But... Piper has never shown any potential for weaving spells before. Will she be able to develop the magical powers she needs in time to save the Mistians?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The Lost Weld is an exciting, fantasy-themed action-adventure game.<br></li><li>The game features a compelling, movie-like 20,000-word script recorded by some of the industry’s top voice-acting talents.<br></li><li>Gameplay alternates between open world exploration, exciting action challenges, and dramatic in-game cutscenes.<br></li><li>The game is being developed by Mama Makes Games, LLC and has quickly attracted a strong following.<br></li><li>The game includes a fully-orchestrated symphonic score in an &quot;epic&quot; romantic style.<br></li><li>The full game will be about 6-8 hours long.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >About the Game's Development</h2><br>When Mama Makes Games began to develop <i>The Lost Weld</i>, it performed a market research study by surveying a standardized sample of 209 American adults through SurveyMonkey Audience. It found that 75% of adults preferred games without explicit violence, 80% preferred games with movie-like dialogue, and 83% preferred games that did not sexually objectify women. These results were the same for both gamers (73% of the sample) and non-gamers. Perhaps most interesting, 86% of adults said they would be specifically interested in a game made by an all-female team. <br><br>Mama Makes Games is trying to make high-quality games for a much broader and more diverse audience than can be reached by the gaming industry's focus on action and horror movie clichés. Just as <i>Frozen</i> had a far larger audience than <i>Rambo</i>, Mama Makes Games' leadership believes that there is a much bigger audience for story-driven action-adventure games that incorporate the more accessible and prosocial content common in popular movies and literature.<br><br> <i>The Lost Weld</i> delivers hours of action and excitement without any violence. The player must directly solve problems through a variety of magical and physical methods, but never harms or kills anyone. In The Lost Weld, the protagonist and most of the main characters are women, but none are portrayed in an objectifying way. These female characters are presented with a variety of body types, ages, and racial features.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Who's Making this Game</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2000990/extras/8d8e2ebd12c151fd71abf02ef98d8c30.avif?t=1695415933\" width=320 height=320 /></span><br><strong>KIMBERLY BLAIS</strong><br><i>Game Designer, Developer, and Writer</i><br><br>The founder of Mama Makes Games, Kimberly Blais first became interested in developing games as co-founder of a software startup that was granted fifteen patents related to e-learning.
