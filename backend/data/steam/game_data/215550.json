The mood we want to capture in Zombie Playground is the feeling that you had as a kid when you were completely immersed in your imagination fighting monsters and doing things you thought were cool from your favorite movies, comics, and video games. <br><br>We've worked long and hard to create a game that delivers on the promise of our original vision. Zombie Playground™ is made with the brains, disease, and puke of all involved - that means heart!<br><br>Gameplay in Zombie Playground is a hybrid of third person shooter and action RPG mechanics set in a cooperative zombie survival horror arena. This translates simply to &quot;A fun romp solo or with friends.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/215550/extras/d2f1f9e96e0bf1dfb749e0f73150bc0c.webp?t=1742538642\" width=616 height=41 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Key Features - What Me Worry??</strong></h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/215550/extras/258b12210b5def87305ac53a372c6d49.webp?t=1742538642\" width=34 height=20 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/215550/extras/4d722cd964da3dd3180d325bad87d806.webp?t=1742538642\" width=15 height=15 /></span>   <strong>Arena Style Map</strong>: Classroom Building Arena Map comprised of a Courtyard, a Main Entrance, and areas for Language Arts, Biology, Computer Science, and Music. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/215550/extras/4d722cd964da3dd3180d325bad87d806.webp?t=1742538642\" width=15 height=15 /></span>   <strong>Multiple Enemy Types + BOSS FIGHT!</strong> Normal, +Elite, and even a Big Bad Boss!
