    "description": "Soak up the eclectic music of the unique indie abstraction known as ULTRAWORLD EXODUS.  Find your favorite chair and take in a twenty five song double album that features spaced out ambiance, catchy orchestrations, and toe-tapping beats.  The sole creator of the game was also the sole creator of the soundtrack so these songs are tightly linked to a specifically designed audio-visual experience.  While originally composed to compliment vibrant landscapes, this unusual mix of songs easily stands on it's own.  So throw on your headphones, sit back, and enjoy!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;...its soundtrack remains a highlight.&quot; - PCGamer<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;It's a gorgeous looking game with an equally nice soundtrack.&quot; - IndieGames.com<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Its soundtrack is also very eccentric, featuring ethereal, electronic, ambient sounds.&quot; - Game Skinny",
