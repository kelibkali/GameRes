    "description": "Horace is a real knight: he loves to drink a lot and eat tasty food, doesn’t wash for weeks, and his only practiced physical exercise is to spit at the ceiling. Fate gives the guy an unexpected gift and immediately takes it away: the beautiful princess falls in love with him, but before the wedding night the dragon Apolion steals her. Enraged, Horace puts on his dusty armor, picks up a sword with a shield and goes after the villain!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe world tries to confuse and prank the hero. The signs on the hero’s path make fun of the player, sometimes give adverse (but very funny!) tips and guide him in the wrong way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nActions take place in a fictional world. The player has the ability to control only the main character using the WASD keys. The goal of the game is to find and save the princess stolen by the villain. Use sword and magic, breaking through crowds of monsters in a confused world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe genre — arcade.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe interface language is Russian or English. The game passing will take about 40 minutes. Hints are provided — signs with appeals to the hero.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game needs only few keys — enjoy the fun and simple story.",
