Hadley's (Agent Parsec) &quot;Slender: The Eight Pages&quot; and Dknighter's &quot;Phasmophobia,&quot; Operator combines the psychological horror and thrill of Slender: The Eight Pages with an interactive voice component affected by the game itself. Explore the forest as you collect 8 manuscripts in an effort to slowly piece together the mystery of a disappearance. However, be wearying of an unknown entity lurking in the trees, with it's mere presence distorting your gaze...<br><br><br><br>Join our Discord for updates regarding new content, server status, and the latest patches in development!",
