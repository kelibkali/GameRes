    "description": "Player is spawned on the island and can fly or walk around it.<br />\r\nOperation is different with ordinary VR flight games. Player has to move his arms as if they are wings. Since its flight movement is based on aerodynamics, player cannot stay same point in the air nor rise automatically. For this reason, It require a little practice to fly at first Just as need practice to ride a bike. This game is a kind of &quot;sports&quot; rather than &quot;video game&quot;. It is unnatural to fly without feeling physical fatigue, isn't it. <br />\r\nHowever it makes you feel like you are really flying in the sky like a bird.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you get to able to fly as you wish you might be little bored. Then you can try &quot;Icarus challenge&quot;. It is very simple mission. Fly and stick your feather into the highest possible place in the monolith. You can check your ranking in the lobby. Aim to be the highest flying player!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNOTE<br />\r\nIf you're struggling to fly, I suggest you start by practicing gliding.<br />\r\nAfter pressing B button to correct view direction, Please jump from a high place and lean your body forward. You don't need to flap your wings to glide.",
