    "description": "Unite is a two-player board game based on Lines of Action (a game created in the 1960's).  Players take turns moving (with some unique rules for movement), trying to connect their pieces.  The single-player mode provides 7 difficulty levels against the AI.  Or play online against an opponent over the network.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis demo version does not include network play, only lets you use one of the 4 different board types, and limits you to only 2 of the 7 different difficulty levels.",
