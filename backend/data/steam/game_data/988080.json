    "description": "3 on 3 Super Robot Hockey is my humble fun version of hockey.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo fouls - so you can push your enemies away as many times as you want, and sometimes it ends up in a fight.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSweet classic organ music and awesome effects when you score a goal. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nInstant replays to enjoy your goal a little bit more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3 AI difficulty settings. Starts out on easy. I highly recommend starting out easy as the AI will not knock you down and they're a bit sluggish.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay solo, or with someone locally. Locally - screen is shared.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFully supports Xbox controllers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCustom controls on Keyboard and Xbox Controllers. For Keyboard, the Numpad area is disabled because of hardware limitations (Several keys pressed at a time sometimes does not register).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMouse is disabled.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFully supports almost any landscape screen size. From small screens 4:3 up to ultrawide screens 21:9. If you have wider screens let me know if it works, that would be awesome. Technically it should, as I designed it like that but I have no way to test it out. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCustomize player names and numbers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore than 20 teams to choose from.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCloud Save for your settings.",
