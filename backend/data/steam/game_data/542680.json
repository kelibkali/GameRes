Though the best offence is a good defense and you can also use Special Moves to save yourself by getting rid of every Block of a certain colour or by throwing exploding Water Balloons to get rid of a bunch of them in one go!<br><br><strong>Cast</strong><br>Super Puzzle Sisters has a cast of 6 Cute Characters, each with their own Special Moves<br>and Strategies, do you pick the reliable and easy Pulse or mix things up with the glass cannon of Persimmon?
