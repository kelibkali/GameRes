Borgmeier from the magazine &quot;Amiga Joker&quot;:</i><br><br>&quot;Nomen est Omen - it may be puzzled again. For a change this time it's not about little stones, instead there are marbles, tubes, discs and lots of tinkering fun ... &quot; - &quot;... If you add in the high addiction factor, there can only be one conclusion: Logical is one of the most beautiful action puzzle games for a long time - an absolute must for friends of the genre&quot;.<br><br>But away with the musty dust. It's time for Logical Now! - Many discs - One color - Many explosions ... and off to the next level!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Contemporary 3D Graphics</h2>Now in 3D rendering, with lights, shadows and great explosions!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Sound and Music</h2>In High Quality and Even In Stereo!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Fresh Levels</h2>Newly created levels, now with even more playing surface!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >New Game Elements</h2>Besides the known, there are many new modules in the game. How about &quot;Master Mind&quot; Turnwheels, for example? Guess which color combination explodes! Or a few switches and walls? - Let yourself be surprised!<br><br><i>But be careful! This puzzle action game is supposed to be addictive - Be warned! :)</i>",
