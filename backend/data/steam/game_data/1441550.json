You can force it to walk, sit, squat or turn it into a pile of guts by stabbing, shooting, burning, beating or tearing it to pieces. Furthermore, these ragdolls are gifted with life-like features such as blood circulation, consciousness and sensation of pain.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >GRAVITY</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1441550/extras/cba06919ce027f262aac1705e851775a.poster.avif?t=1664528485\" width=600 height=300 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1441550/extras/cba06919ce027f262aac1705e851775a.webm?t=1664528485\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1441550/extras/cba06919ce027f262aac1705e851775a.mp4?t=1664528485\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Gravity is a given, but in Regular Human Workshop some levels have their own unique types of gravitation. Each and every object or effect in the game are designed to adjust to these gravitational differences.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >AUTOMATION</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1441550/extras/22089324e118c757431cf8213ada474b.poster.avif?t=1664528485\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1441550/extras/22089324e118c757431cf8213ada474b.webm?t=1664528485\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1441550/extras/22089324e118c757431cf8213ada474b.mp4?t=1664528485\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Most of the game's objects can be connected together using <strong>IO</strong> (Input/Output) system, which is designed to be as easy to use as possible. Connect the button with the gun using wires (see the example above); and now when the button is pressed, the gun will fire. With this simple <strong>when</strong> something happens, <strong>do</strong> something system, everyone can create fun automatons using myriad of devices, sensors, detectors and other objects. On top of that, the game allows loop connections, which makes it possible to create complex automation systems.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >SLOW MOTION</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1441550/extras/4a89c45a8a2cc882f526563f9b5dece4.poster.avif?t=1664528485\" width=600 height=340 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1441550/extras/4a89c45a8a2cc882f526563f9b5dece4.webm?t=1664528485\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1441550/extras/4a89c45a8a2cc882f526563f9b5dece4.mp4?t=1664528485\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Things may be happening too fast for the naked eye to catch in this world. And sometimes you just want to witness the spectacle of a bullet flying through ragdoll's body or an explosion turning a structure into rubble in it's full glory. A possibility to slow down or pause the time with a press of a button allows you to witness mayhem that unfolds in a slower pace.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >SAVE SYSTEM</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1441550/extras/2bd75767a26a6a51ee520a92abb87547.poster.avif?t=1664528485\" width=600 height=340 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1441550/extras/2bd75767a26a6a51ee520a92abb87547.webm?t=1664528485\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1441550/extras/2bd75767a26a6a51ee520a92abb87547.mp4?t=1664528485\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Sometimes you want to keep your creations for later use.
