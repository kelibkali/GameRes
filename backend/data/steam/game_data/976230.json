Created by a passionate solo indie game developer, TV189 features <strong>9 carefully curated levels</strong> designed to help the player master the art of intuition as their skills are put to the test with <strong>close-quarters combat</strong> as well as <strong>puzzle based gameplay</strong>. I believe the player should be in the centre of the experience by including a <strong>skill tree</strong>: giving you the choice between strength and ammunition abilities.<br><br>The game features a<strong> thoroughly written story</strong> expressed through a mix of <strong>voice acted cutscenes</strong>,  <strong>in-game notes &amp; documents</strong> in an expansive, <strong>constantly evolving plot</strong>. From waking up in a morgue at an underground facility to going on recovery/assassination missions, TV189 utilizes a range of gameplay types oriented around a <strong>variety-driven user experience</strong>.<br><br>Exploration into the map is <strong>rewarded with much-needed ammunition</strong> and transmitters. Use these transmitters to <strong>upgrade your character</strong> either to conserve ammo more efficiently or regenerate health faster with 15 different skills to learn and unlock, with 2 final <i><strong>'master abilities'</strong></i>.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/976230/extras/3748e57bce5139f64acb8ce3c502a505.poster.avif?t=1732115276\" width=630 height=92 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/976230/extras/3748e57bce5139f64acb8ce3c502a505.webm?t=1732115276\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/976230/extras/3748e57bce5139f64acb8ce3c502a505.mp4?t=1732115276\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>You wake up in a morgue months after working in a covert operation in Timalyun, Russia. Infected with a new mysterious virus, your body was isolated and contained to stop the disease from spreading. The <strong>Russian Front Force (R.F.F.)</strong> are a independent terrorist organisation <strong>threatening mass-destruction to the world stage with a mystery biological weapon dubbed 'TV189'</strong>.<br><br>However, unbeknownst to them is that your developed immunity means you can enter Timalyun and other R.F.F. controlled areas without danger of infection.  Using this new founded ability and backed by several UN nations you must <strong>execute a cloak-and-dagger operation</strong> to <strong>put an end to the R.F.F. from the inside</strong>. From repossessing ill-obtained cash and servers to climbing onto the roof of a compound to access the venting system in an assassination assignment , TV189 presents a <strong>variety of level types</strong> and styles, each with their own <strong>themes, locations and atmospheres</strong>.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/976230/extras/43ce0adae3874e25959e9614dd2fea88.poster.avif?t=1732115276\" width=630 height=90 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/976230/extras/43ce0adae3874e25959e9614dd2fea88.webm?t=1732115276\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/976230/extras/43ce0adae3874e25959e9614dd2fea88.mp4?t=1732115276\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Since early access, TCG has worked hard to include a <strong>wide variety of new features</strong> to enhance the game; <strong>each level has received a complete overhaul</strong>, with new levels being added and certain scenes not making the cut leading to a refined experience including:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Full Inventory System</strong> with a large arsenal of weapons.<br></li><li> <strong>Skill Tree System</strong> which allows specializing in strength and ammunition abilities.<br></li><li> <strong>Dynamic Levels</strong>, where danger may be around every corner.<br></li><li> <strong>Indoor/Outdoor Scenes</strong> featuring a mix of <strong>long range &amp; close-quarters combat</strong>.</li></ul>",
