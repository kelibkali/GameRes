The desire to reach the next stage of evolution, which ran contrary to the facts of nature, formed the study of illegal modification to human cells. Because of this, a special unit was formed by mercenaries who opposed human experimentation. One of the major terrorist groups created a secret base in the jungle and started the project &quot;Confluence&quot;, combining plant cells with human cells. The group of scientists that worked on this experimental process also raised an army of soulless bio-soldiers to guard the project. But during the final experiment, &quot;Confluence&quot; went out of control and began taking over its surroundings. You, as one of the best mercenaries, will have to stop the project in the only way possible: break into its epicenter and blast it to smithereens!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/527750/extras/aa5411a15ede7e25528f37c66f1028c4.avif?t=1760394794\" width=616 height=346 /></span><br><br>The game takes its roots from classic first-person shooters, a series of games such as Wolfenstein 3D, Spear Of Destiny, Operation Bodycount, Blake Stone and many others. The color palette is taken from Operation Bodycount, while the game uses a unique graphical style, approximately similar to Wolfenstein 3D. In Merger 3D, you'll need to pass through long levels, breaking through many crowds of enemies.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/527750/extras/7cd42f28f7862504918112f299395894.avif?t=1760394794\" width=616 height=288 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>15 levels<br></li><li>many crowd of angry enemies, each led by an unusual boss<br></li><li>classic old school gameplay<br></li><li>a large arsenal of powerful weapons with unique characteristics<br></li><li>musical arrangements by Jimmy</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/527750/extras/2b511e7697cecfbae67336161dc2315e.avif?t=1760394794\" width=616 height=290 /></span>",
