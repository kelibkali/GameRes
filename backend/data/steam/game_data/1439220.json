    "description": "<strong>Conquest: Medieval Kingdoms </strong> is a turn-based 4X grand strategy game, played on a procedurally generated world. <br><br>You may start as the ruler of a vast empire, or perhaps a tiny fledgling kingdom.<br>Raise armies, conquer territory and forge an empire that stretches across the entire globe to claim victory!<br><br>Battles are real-time and tactical. Run straight at the enemy if you want, but don't be surprised if they've laid a trap.<br>Cavalry, swordsmen, spearmen and archers need to be placed strategically on the field or they will be wiped out before you know it.<br>Running wildly at the enemy is a recipe for destruction.<br><br>And don't think you can just steamroll the map. Religious and ethnic differences mean rebellions are always in the air.<br>Spend your time to convert assimilate your subjects or expect a dagger in your back.<br><br>Every world-map and battlefield is entirely procedurally generated, so this game will always have something to throw at you.",
