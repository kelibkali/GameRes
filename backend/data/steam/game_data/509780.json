    "description": "Fire Arrow and Fire Arrow X are time attack (or 'Caravan', what used to be an important tradition in Japanese STGs in 90s) style shooters with a heavy emphasis on scoring, also known as &quot;coffee break shmups&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFire Arrow (Remastered):<br />\r\n• Enemy waves and various other elements are randomized. Unpredictable special events may even trigger on subsequent plays.<br />\r\n• Difficulty ramps up rather quickly and the better you do, the harder it will get.<br />\r\n• Collect as many medals as you can, as you progress further into the game, they will become more valuable and plentiful.<br />\r\n• Novice, 3 Minute, 5 Minute modes provide varying levels of challenge as well as a potentially greater variety of enemies and bosses to encounter. There is also a special unlockable mode that provides the greatest challenge.<br />\r\n• Freely switch between a wide spread shot (Red) and a narrow vulcan shot (Blue) to better adapt to the situation. Unlock the bonus ship for even greater firepower!<br />\r\n• Along with screen-clearing bombs, you also have a powerful DUAL ATTACK.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNEW to Steam version:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n• New endings!<br />\r\n• More convenient menus.<br />\r\n• Completely rebalanced gameplay.<br />\r\n• Bonus round is now accessible by normal play on a certain mode.<br />\r\n• All new original soundtrack.<br />\r\n• Native gamepad support.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFire Arrow X :<br />\r\n• This semi-sequel or semi-remake depending on how you look at it expands upon the basic gameplay of Fire Arrow while also changing up some of the rules.<br />\r\n• All the same modes and explosive action... now with more enemies, crazier bosses and even greater challenges!",
