The teachers and the staff are mean, her friends are few, and her grades suck. Worst of all – Belle has a tendency to be at exactly the wrong place at exactly the wrongest time. Like tonight, for example, when she stayed up late to practice her fire magic, but instead got framed for upsetting an ancient ritual. And what better way is there to punish an unlucky first-year student, than to charge her with an impossible task on the worst night of the year? Re-create the Walpurgisnacht Brew, or be expelled, and with all manner of spooks taking over the school, expulsion is starting to sound better by the minute.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/332610/extras/87bb8a517c1a7b9bcf105550979cfab6.avif?t=1728320042\" width=618 height=160 /></span>Inspired by games like <strong>Slightly Magic, Puff in Dragonland, and the Dizzy series</strong>, Mystik Belle is a hybrid of a classic point-and-click adventure and a modern metroidvania.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/332610/extras/71ca198d582c7cf5a15197012ccdf37e.webp?t=1728320042\" width=618 height=38 /></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You may experience all of the following while playing this game:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Get hopelessly lost in the massive school building and its surrounding areas.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Find items and solve inventory puzzles.
