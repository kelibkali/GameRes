Stephens</strong><br><strong>A Near-Death Experience</strong><br><i>The undead Corpse Fleet has appeared in orbit above the Gate of Twelve Suns, intent on seizing the ancient alien superweapon called the Stellar Degenerator. The heroes are massively outgunned, and their only hope to defeat the Corpse Fleet is by infiltrating the fleet's flagship and taking control of the vessel's bridge. Only then can the heroes pilot the ship on a collision course with the superweapon in a desperate bid to end both threats at once. If successful, the heroes can destroy the Stellar Degenerator, but they'll need to escape the carnage to live to tell the tale!</i><br><i>This volume of Starfinder Adventure Path concludes the Dead Suns Adventure Path and includes:</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>&quot;Empire of Bones,&quot; a Starfinder adventure for 11th-level characters, by Owen K.C.
