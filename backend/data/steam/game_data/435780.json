Decades worth of data are still uncollected. That’s where you come in, Candidate Alpha. We need you to collect the caches of information adrift in space. A number of collection sites have been located, but there are too many unknown astrophysical factors. We cannot guarantee your safety. <br><br>Violet: Space Mission is a 2D precision action game in space, about dodging asteroids, data collection and space exploration. You are Candidate Alpha, sent on the Violet Programme for this mission. Good luck and godspeed. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/435780/extras/6fc33ec67aa37201008b0389ead192bd.webp?t=1453452530\" width=630 height=50 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">   <li>Dodge asteroids.<br>   </li><li>Zero gravity in 2D.<br>   </li><li>Hand drawn art and animations.<br>   </li><li>Precision gameplay.
