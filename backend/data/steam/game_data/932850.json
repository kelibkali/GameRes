    "description": "Simmiland is a god game.<br>Watch how mankind develops!<br><br><strong>What the heck is Simmiland?</strong><br>In Simmiland you create a small civilization that you can only influence indirectly by playing cards to the land, such as plants🍃 and minerals ⛰️. Playing a plant on a grass biome tile will result in a wheat plant, but playing a plant card somewhere else will also create something else. Try to experiment as much as you can!<br><br>Playing cards costs ✨ 'faith' ✨ that you gain from the humans when they periodically pray for you, or when you fulfill their wishes. One may wish for a berry bush and another for a deadly plague ☠️<br><br>One of the more important cards is the ⚗️ 'inspect' ⚗️ card. This card can be played on items, objects and sometimes just on empty tiles. The inspect card will trigger an invention that will help the humans explore your world further.<br><br>The way you shape the land and guide the humans will decide which way the humans will develop. They can go as far as to build a rocket! 🚀<br><br><strong>The metagame</strong><br>You can play Simmiland in 2 different modes:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Normal mode - your card deck is limited and you will find the apocalypse card at the bottom<br></li><li> Endless mode - you can play an endless amount of cards, but you won't get any achievements</li></ul><br>In normal mode you <i>will</i> get achievements. Both achievements and progress will net you some in-game currency which you can use to buy new and more cards to fill your deck, giving opportunity to new possibilities.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Quick, but relaxing, 10~60 minutes play per game<br></li><li> An alternative endless mode where you can shape the land into infinity<br></li><li> ~20 different cards<br></li><li> 13 different biome types<br></li><li> 30+ inventions to discover<br></li><li> 40+ different resources to discover<br></li><li> 20+ different achievements to find</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/932850/extras/c350ac25322f0cc81d29044611c576b9.avif?t=1639491610\" width=200 height=70 /></span><br>Sokpop makes a new game every two weeks!<br>Subscribe for 3$ per month at ",
