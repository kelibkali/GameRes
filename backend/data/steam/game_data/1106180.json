    "description": "-- 2021 Upcoming update --<br><br>One liner about NEXT release: <strong>SpriteStack is a 3D animator/editor that combines voxels, lowpoly and sprites to make 2D game assets in form of spritesheets.</strong><br><br>Do not worry to get current version of SpriteStack - it's the one that will get updated with all the new features you can read about there . After the update the price will go up so it's the best moment to get it - also it helps me to focus on SpriteStack instead of looking for funds.<br><br>-- Old (current) version description --<br><br>SpriteStack is a 3d pixelart editor based on sprite stacking technique. It's a special kind of voxel editor suited for 2D artists where the model is drawn layer by layer like a pixelart. Featuring handcrafted retro renderer and experimental animation support.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Examples</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1106180/extras/aea046e2967b01db63819fc84e4b6ff1.poster.avif?t=1625519089\" width=204 height=204 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1106180/extras/aea046e2967b01db63819fc84e4b6ff1.webm?t=1625519089\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1106180/extras/6ed66594c362d4e5b896958be151739a.poster.avif?t=1625519089\" width=204 height=204 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1106180/extras/6ed66594c362d4e5b896958be151739a.webm?t=1625519089\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1106180/extras/5f3e664f78e3d40f1cef841fb45ba8f0.poster.avif?t=1625519089\" width=204 height=204 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1106180/extras/5f3e664f78e3d40f1cef841fb45ba8f0.webm?t=1625519089\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Editor</h2>Each model is made of 2D slices that create a 3D volume when put on top of each other.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1106180/extras/a2b294187060f98e27553fc5824f5a54.avif?t=1625519089\" width=616 height=346 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Animator</h2>Animation support is experimental but it can already yeld nice results.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1106180/extras/d9146b5baaafff8a55b088eba504fe4b.avif?t=1625519089\" width=616 height=346 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Exporter</h2>Top notch exporter featuring unique low resolution renderer stylized to look like pixelart.
