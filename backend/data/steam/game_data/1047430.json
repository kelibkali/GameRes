My name is Mikhail. I'm the creator of Zulin Time. First and foremost, I'd like to thank you for choosing my game. I hope you like it and have lots of fun playing it. To be honest, I've been waiting for someone to create a game like this for quite a while, alas no one did... Thus, I had to take matters into my own hands! Plus, I just love making games and hope to have a chance to bring more of my ideas to life. Thank you for giving me this opportunity!",
