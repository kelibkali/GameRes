During the day, painted barbarians engage with arrows, spears, and skirmish attacks, seeming to appear as if by magic, then fade into the undergrowth. At night, fellow legionaries vanish and strange cries are heard on the wind. Legio IX is on edge. Theyve been pushed hard, and are ready to push back.</i><br><i>Someone must find the source of the Picts strengthand destroy it.</i><br>For use with Weird Wars Rome or any Savage Worlds game.<br><i>Fantasy Grounds Conversion:</i> <strong>Matt Rimler</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Savage Worlds ruleset.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Matt Rimler</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
