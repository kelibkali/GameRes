    "description": "If you like games with rockets... well... here's another one ;o)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter years in development, finally Another Rocket Game has made it to Steam!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInspired by and brought to life by the countless hours spent playing one of the old Amiga Classics, &quot;Turboraketti&quot;, Another Rocket Game aims to be a game about mastering the art of controlling subtle, yet crucial abilities an armed 2D rocket requires to make it through obstacles and enemies of various kinds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nApart from the classic split-screen player vs player mode, which was where &quot;Turboraketti&quot; excelled, Another Rocket Game features a complete story based campaign mode, in which you follow Spacey Pete and his trusty rocket Celeste, as they journey to &quot;The Danger Zone&quot; looking for adventure and treasure in the form of &quot;Space Jewels&quot;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurthermore, all levels can be played and challenged seperately, either by your self, against a computer AI or against friends in split-screen mode.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll levels are featured on the online &quot;Hall Of Highscores&quot; on the Games By Nemiz website, where players can challenge eachother across all games released by Games By Nemiz as well as just in specific games or levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI hope you enjoy playing the game and testing your abilities as much as I have enjoyed developing it. Everything was made from scratch by two year-long rocket game enthusiasts :o)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI also hope, you enjoy the soundtrack as much as I do. All melodies are composed by none other than Mr.Lou, who apart from being the creator of IndieGameMusic, is also one of the best digital music composers of my time (and who happens to be my brother as well ;o).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnyway. Enjoy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNemiz.",
