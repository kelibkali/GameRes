It always has and always will. The army of the greenskins is washing over the world. You are not the kind of creature who likes to get their head bashed in and so you found a quiet corner of the Fell to setup in. Your tower, a ruin of an older time is where you keep your trophies, your tools and your very comfortable bed.<br>But you still help! For a price...<br>The army constantly needs new heroes and you've got a great little thing going here, growing some young goblins and sending them to the deep dungeons to get trained. Then, if they come back, you can send them to the war to become good little soldiers. But they are always asking for more. Bigger, better and stronger recruits. So you need to upgrade your operation, prepare them better.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A beautiful word to explore at your own pace, filled with secrets and exotic landscapes.<br></li><li>Dark humour in a ridiculous world.<br></li><li>A deep and rewarding crafting and upgrades system.<br></li><li>Fishing!<br></li><li>Very challenging combat in procedurally generated dungeons.</li></ul>",
