    "description": "Blastonier is a short 2D physics-based experience with minimal neon graphics where your goal is to shoot a ball through a level full of obstacles and into a green win zone to win levels and move on to the next. To do this you only need your mouse to aim your shot, left click to fire a shot in the direction of your mouse, and space bar to retrieve your shots and refill your ammo (your only allowed 2 shots at a time). There are 100 handmade levels requiring a mixture of skill, timing, and luck to win.",
