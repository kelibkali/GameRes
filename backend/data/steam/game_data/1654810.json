It is designed with beginners in mind with tutorials and automatic vibe nodes to help make it so you don't need to know anything about music to have fun. For those who want to push it a bit further, you can edit each note, scale, and FX to get a node to sound exactly how you'd like. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong><i>DISCLAIMER: Mix Universe is NOT a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) and also is not intended to be used for live performances. I view it as a game first, so a lot of DAW-like features are beyond the scope and vision of the game. The Mixes you create are  owned by you, but you currently do not have a license to export them for sale. You are free to take videos and share the content on various social media platforms or stream your creations.
