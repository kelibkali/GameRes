This mission was known as Freedom 7, also referred to as Mercury-Redstone 3.   <br>  <br>Unfortunately, the mission failed because the spaceship was unable to navigate the hazards on Mercury's surface.   <br>  <br>60 years later, on the same day in 2021, NASA finally invented a sophisticated vehicle called Acrobatic Car, so the mission has continued.   <br>  <br>7 adventurous clowns, willing to leave Earth, were sent to Mercury to claim the Redstone and bring it back. They sought to prove their heroism and show that they were more than just &quot;nothing but clowns&quot;.   <br>  <br>The 7 clowns were professional and trained enough for the mission, but once they landed, they realised they were not the only ones going for the Redstone, another clown named SkilledBird was seeking it too.   <br>  <br>He was so skilled that his abilities had never been seen before. Rumours say that he is an alien from another planet, others say that he was a champion in the world of Elasto Mania but came to this world for an unknown reason.   <br>  <br>Whatever the truth is, they have to beat him, be faster than him to get to the Redstone before he does.  <br>---------------------  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  </p>",
