As one went to programming and game development, the other went for a cinematic path. Thanks to our long-term friendship over the years we have managed to find a way to dissolve our paths into the project that now we can gladly call, Open Door Games.<br><br>As we crossed our path together in this project, we truly believe that we are going to deliver a different type of game from the ones we see today, and we wish everyone to experience the cross between the cinema and the game development world.",
