The landscape uses Multilayering shading with support for direct modification of the underlying texture. When targeting Assetto Corsa the export prepares the objects ready to be imported into the AC Editor, generating the Configuration file so that materials and textures are applied as they appeared in RTB.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>UPDATE</strong>: From March 2025, Google now requires Billing to be enabled and they have changed the way they bill. They now give a free quota per month of 10,000 images (for the background image) and  5,000 Elevation requests (For height data). This is only 2 x 8K images at Very High quality per month. Use lower quality to test first. Elevation data is unlikely to hit the limit.</p>",
