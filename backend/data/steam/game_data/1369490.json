    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >  Referee's Briefing 4: Mercenary Forces</h2>Violence can and does solve problems, if properly applied. Of course, the application of violence can result in new or additional problems, but the original issue is solved at least. Mercenaries offer a short-term solution to the question of where to obtain and how to deliver the necessary violence, and can also solve other problems by being officially deniable. Referee's Briefing 4: Mercenary Forces is a guide to local mercenary outfits and how they operate, letting you know who is for hire, who is recruiting... or who will be storming through your own defences.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong></strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Traveller 2E (Mongoose) ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
