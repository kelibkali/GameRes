Even further down still are the infernal hellholes where all manners of foulness, evil and monstrosity live.  An unliving hell just under our feet! This is a game about life in the darkness, the horror relieved only by the weekly SCUMBALL DERBY RACE!<br><br><strong>WHEN THERE IS NO MORE ROOM ON THE TRACK TO DRIVE… YOU JUST HAVE TO RUN THEM OVER!</strong><br><br>When you die from a “terminal disease” they send you down here. As cannon fodder for the cars! These souped-up, armored and armed jalopies are designed to race, built to crash, and perfected to mow over as many Zombies as they can. <br><br><strong>SO THROW IT IN DRIVE AND GRIND EM UP! SPLAT GOES THE ZOMBIE! <br>IF THE BLOOD AIN’T FLYIN, YOU AIN’T TRYIN!</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Features: </strong></h2></h2></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>We have designed absolutely unique control system for this game and called it “KANT Controls”, which is great possibility for VR users to found themselves fully immersed into the VR driving game. </li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>We already have 2 unique vehicles and plan to add 2 more in the nearest future.<br></li><li>Running over Zombies gives you power-ups, but there is a system to the madness.
