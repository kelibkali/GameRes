    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > Pathfinder 2 RPG - Agents of Edgewatch AP 5: Belly of the Black Whale</h2>The Agents of Edgewatch Adventure Path continues! Having been betrayed by their confidants and stripped of their badges, the Edgewatch agents must perform a daring prison break to spring the wrongly incarcerated primarch. Old enemies become new friends as the heroes work for an infamous underworld crime lord in order to prove their fealty and receive blueprints to the enchanted prison galley known as the Black Whale. Once they've rescued their key ally, the heroes must find a way to clear their sullied names and, in the process, exact justice upon the treacherous business mogul who betrayed them in the first place.<br>&quot;Belly of the Black Whale&quot; is a Pathfinder adventure for four 15th-level characters.
