The fact that you’re lacking your usual 3D posture is significant not only for the story you’re about to experience but more importantly for the way you play. When compared with a real being, a shadow, by its nature, is subject to different laws of physics. It needs light to exist, and dark places are its biggest enemy. Shadows always need a surface onto which they can slip, so when it comes to negotiating obstacles, you’ll need to figure out smarter ways than simply jumping over them. Remember that your shadow self will transform depending on the angle of light, and that changing perspective or camera view might be of key importance to solving certain spatial puzzles. Prepare for a game that’s unlike anything you’ve played before.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1127820/extras/9b7079a30100f1a6a6d1055f8f39edb5.webp?t=1746036388\" width=600 height=35 /></span><br><br><strong>Set off on an extraordinary, symbolic journey</strong> – stay open-minded, revisit your memories, but be warned that not all of them are worth remembering;<br><br><strong>Experience the true meaning of “moving like a shadow”</strong> – forget all the rules of movement that other games have taught you, and try to look at the world around you from an entirely new perspective instead;<br><br><strong>Collect pieces of your memory</strong> – try to rebuild the past from the scraps of memory buried deep in your mind;<br><br><strong>Enjoy the unique graphic design</strong> – unusual graphics will help keep you immersed in this remarkable world while staying focused on exploring your memories; <br><br><strong>See how real-life art can inspire game developers</strong> – an Etruscan sculpture – Ombra Della Sera and artists such as Adolphe Appia, Josef Svoboda, Yannis Kokkos, Frank Miller, and James Turrell inspired the creators of Repressed to bring this game to life;<br><br><strong>Listen to a one-of-a-kind, disturbing yet addictive soundtrack</strong> – immerse yourself in the game world while listening to the unique soundtrack composed by Bogdan Mizerski.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1127820/extras/797f82f0f0e5c67f27edc8442c38cfc7.poster.avif?t=1746036388\" width=600 height=250 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1127820/extras/797f82f0f0e5c67f27edc8442c38cfc7.webm?t=1746036388\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1127820/extras/797f82f0f0e5c67f27edc8442c38cfc7.mp4?t=1746036388\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1127820/extras/6415408165610db71ff09f62579ac23e.webp?t=1746036388\" width=600 height=35 /></span>",
