    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >D&amp;D Classics: PHBR8 The Complete Book of Elves</h2><strong> The glorious world of elvenkind shines from these pages!</strong><br>Detailed in this tome are their societies, rituals, and myths - and their physiology and psychology. Descriptions of every kind of elf abound. Rounding out this information are 11 new kits; new optional rules and suggestions for running elven campaigns; and special elven equipment, spells, and magical items.<br>Forget what you thought you knew about elves - The Complete Book of Elves sheds new light on this mysterious race!<br><strong><br><i> We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today. Some older content may reflect ethnic, racial, and gender prejudice that were commonplace in American society at that time. These depictions were wrong then and are wrong today. This content is presented as it was originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed. Dungeons &amp; Dragons teaches that diversity is a strength, and we strive to make our D&amp;D products as welcoming and inclusive as possible. This part of our work will never end.</i></strong><br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Mike Wilson</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the D&amp;D Classics - AD&amp;D 1E/2E ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
