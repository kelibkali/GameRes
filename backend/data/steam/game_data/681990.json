    "description": "Battle Squares is an ever-changing arena where you'll compete with up to (3) other players to earn Atlas Points <strong>(AP)</strong>. You'll do this by completing quests, collecting treasures, avoiding obstacles, and outsmarting your opponents as they try to do the same. <br><br>In Battle Squares you control your movement, your character, your items, and your abilities -- it's up to you to execute a winning strategy against the opposition.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/681990/extras/cd9808ec3e1aa7a920d2ff4f8b40b8e2.avif?t=1548979467\" width=610 height=98 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Character Selection</strong></h2></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Choose from an array of unique characters each with their own twists and quirks.
