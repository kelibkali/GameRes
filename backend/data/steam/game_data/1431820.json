    "description": "This is a collection of music that is featured in the old-school MMO Damascus (). <br><br>The music of this game is an interested case as the tracks were originally written for a completely different project. However that project fell through but we did manage to re-appropriate some of the music for this release and luckily they fit perfectly. <br><br>Tracks 1 - 5 were written in 2019 and  were available previously on my Bandcamp but have now been added to this OST along with tracks 6 and 7 which were written recently to coincide with an update for the game.<br><br>Hope you enjoy it and if you like the music be sure to check out the game.",
