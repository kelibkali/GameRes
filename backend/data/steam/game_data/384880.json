After years of trying cases as a trial lawyer your efforts have finally been noticed by the State's Governor. Although your recent appointment as a judge forces you to start at the bottom of the judicial totem pole it's only a matter of time until you become a State Supreme Court Justice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWeigh evidence from the lowly traffic courts to the Court of Appeals as you gain favor with the Governor to become a State Supreme Court Justice.",
