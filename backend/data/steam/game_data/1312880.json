    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >ABOUT THIS GAME </h2><br>Midas destroys everything he touches, Tintin can craft new platforms and items for Midas to jump off, the two of them are in a journey to escape the deepness of the dungeon, by destroying and crafting a new world around them. <br><br>Jump, Run, Destroy, and Craft in this cute and challenging adventure.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >THE PLATFORMER</h2>Rompe retains the typical elements of a platformer, however, it brings an alternative basic element present in some titles and moments of other games in the genre, and that is that you basically break everything you touch (how challenging!). Starting from that basis, extra care is at the order of each jump and movement, and if we add to this the progressive level of difficulty and the inclusion of different elements, we have a quite entertaining game, even in this phase of development.",
