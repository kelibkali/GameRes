    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >    D&amp;D Classics: Evil Tide (2E)</h2>YOU SHOULD BE AFRAID OF THE WATER... When the sun sinks low, the sea devils rise dripping from the dark waves. They swarm like sharks, lethal and unstoppable. Death glints like a promise in their rabid eyes, and the blood of their prey paints their claws and teeth scarlet. Night after night they come, slaying all who stand in their way. Their sudden raids have devastated the island, bringing fishing and commerce to a halt as the people cower in their homes, dreading the next sunset. Desperate, the Potentate of Angleburg has sent for help from daring adventurers willing to face the devil men of the deep. But more secrets lurk beneath the waves: this is no passing attack but part of a more sinister, secret design by the most dangerous and capable race to inhabit the dark seas.<br><i>    Evil Tide</i>    is the first of an adventure trilogy (continuing with<br><i>    Night of the Shark</i>    and concluding in<br><i>    Sea of Blood</i>    ) that pits brave adventurers against the evil race called Sahuagin by the air-breathing races. The sahuagin adventure trilogy can be played seperately or linked together to form a seamless epic-length adventure. The sahuagin trilogy supports<br><i>    Monstrous Arcana: Sea Devils</i>    , a source book providing invaluable, fascinating, and immediately applicable supplementary information.<br><i>  <strong>    We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today.
