To select a weapon,  if it is available to you, shoot the target that appears  under the weapon.<br>Not all the weapons are equally effective in different modes! Choose the weapons individually for a specific mode.<br>For example, a gun will be less effective in &quot;Survival&quot; than a shotgun.  And the shotgun, in turn, is less effective in &quot;Defence&quot; mode.<br>With Akimbo you will feel comfortable in almost any mode!<br>Each weapon has its specific type of damage when hits in the head or body. Each weapon has its own bullets spread, accuracy, reloading speed and shooting, as well as ammunition.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/496960/extras/9bbd9c3213122ef1269270b2dae94144.avif?t=1572319840\" width=600 height=70 /></span><br>You'll get more points and credits in more complicated modes (such as &quot;Survival&quot;), and at the higher levels of difficulty.<br>In the &quot;Survival&quot; mode, at the highest level of difficulty, you can get the maximum number of points and credits.<br>But there is one nuance, you do not get points and credits for killing zombies with the bare hands - use your weapon!<br><br>Also do not forget the birds - they bring more points than the zombies!<br><br>You will receive your points and credits only if you win the round - at a loss the points and credits are not charged!<br><br>For your credits you can unlock new weapons in the Main Menu, for using it afterwards in the game.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/496960/extras/fd6b59686ef4f57501cd9f6d58900b74.avif?t=1572319840\" width=600 height=70 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Tactics is everything for us!
