Maybe even more. Added melee and tackles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Hit &amp; Push</h2>Basically you hit and push a big ball using your bat and your body.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Hit power control</h2>Using a technique known from many sports, using your body rotation to add power to the hit, flicking your mouse (move it fast), you can control the amount of power you add to your swing. The same way you can aim up- and downwards.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1223680/extras/6629725b172b90de80b5d1f041fce6ee.poster.avif?t=1657629228\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1223680/extras/6629725b172b90de80b5d1f041fce6ee.webm?t=1657629228\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1223680/extras/6629725b172b90de80b5d1f041fce6ee.mp4?t=1657629228\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >It's all about timing</h2><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1223680/extras/fa48381fe891f4c6e9bcbf3617a1dadf.poster.avif?t=1657629228\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1223680/extras/fa48381fe891f4c6e9bcbf3617a1dadf.webm?t=1657629228\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1223680/extras/fa48381fe891f4c6e9bcbf3617a1dadf.mp4?t=1657629228\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>How the ball reacts to a hit depends on quite a few factors, and yes it is difficult to understand at first, if you never tried anything like this before IRL.

The ball becomes hot+glowing and this makes it able to break/melt through the goal shield. The glow does not last forever; how long, is linked to the amount of power of the hit.<br><br>Beware: the glowing ball can damage enemies.
