    "description": "<strong>Zenzizenzic</strong> hurls you into the abstract perils of a bullet-strewn fever dream. Battle your way through <strong>five varied levels in Classic Mode</strong> or <strong>explore an open world in Macro Mode</strong>, both of which are stuffed to the brim with legions of enemies. You'll dodge an onslaught of bullets while returning fire with an awesome arsenal of weapons and power-ups, leaving complete and utter destruction in your wake.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/327500/extras/ebb5149a39e9219a7763185fddf6255e.avif?t=1721044903\" width=612 height=234 /></span><br>In <strong>Classic Mode</strong> (single player or local co-op), you'll face five distinctly different levels with their own challenges, theme, bonus level and boss encounter. Arm yourself with two multi-layered weapon systems of your choosing such as screen-filling lasers, homing missile barrages, highly destructive charge shots, time jumps to slow the action down, black holes that warp and redirect immediate threats and more. <br><br>High scores don't come to the faint of heart, so test your mettle in multiple training modes. And hey, if you're in the mood for a grueling challenge, try Gauntlet Mode to try and complete all five levels in a single run.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/327500/extras/591a72b7cca849ebec8641f1e4885a62.avif?t=1721044903\" width=612 height=234 /></span><br><strong>Macro Mode</strong> (single player only) is inspired by roguelikes with an open, random and procedurally generated world based on the levels in Classic Mode. Find upgrades to enhance your ship to epic proportions— you'll need to, because you're bound to encounter massive enemies that span multiple screens! It'll take brawn and brains to tackle monsters, uncover hidden secrets and discover varying ways of optimizing your score.<br><br>Welcome to the bullet-ridden world of Zenzizenzic. Go on— give it your best shot!<br><br><strong>Zenzizenzic is published by Adult Swim Games and currently available for a 20% discount during the first week of release!</strong>",
