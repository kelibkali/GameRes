    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Main Features</h2><strong>Put Some G-Power In Your Weapons</strong><br>GG2 offers 6 main weapons, each has a unique feel, ammunition, an alternate fire mode, a variety of unique power-ups and you can even level them up. Every time you kill enemies, they will drop small G letters. Collect them to power up your weapons to make them more and more deadly over time. But be aware! Each time an enemy hits you, you will lose a certain amount of G-Power.<br><br><strong>Explore New Worlds</strong><br>The game starts off in a small building, from which you have to escape. The more you explore, the more will the world open up. Get more and more items and power-ups that will give you the necessary abilities to reach new places. Find abandoned subway-stations to travel to far-away new places or go through portals and travel across the hellish parallel-dimension!<br><br><strong>Power-Up Your Character</strong><br>Another feature is the Power-Up system. Whenever you obtain special Power-Orbs in the game, you can use them in your status screen to upgrade ascpects, weapons or items of your character. You decide if a weapon should have more power, bigger clip size, faster fire rate etc, or if you need more protection, or better health supplies. Spend your Power-Orbs wisely to become more versatile or focus them to become a specialized killing machine.<br><br><strong>Advanced Blood &amp; Gore FX</strong><br>When I go see a zombie movie and there are no bucketloads of blood in it, I would say “Hey mister, cool flick, but where’s the damn blood?”. To avoid such emails from angry players, GunGirl 2 offers a whole ton of high-quality blood effects to please all zombie fans!<br><br><strong>Lots of Quests</strong><br>There are several main- and sub-quests in the game. You can get them from surviving npcs or even from unholy items and they have smaller or bigger impacts on the story. They are NOT grind-quests to cheat a longer playtime! That’s a no-go<br><br><strong>High Replayability Value</strong><br>If the 4-8 hours of playtime (on normal mode) aren’t enough for your zombiekilling-desire, the game offers a total of 3 difficulty settings (from Normal to Iron Maiden), unlockable playmodes and even a secret character!<br><br><strong>Music by Josh Whelchel</strong><br>This guy is pure gold. He made some of the most memorable soundtracks for indie-games such as Bonesaw or The Spirit Engine 2 and now he has blessed this game with another awesome soundtrack :)",
