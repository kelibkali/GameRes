    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A Comedic Choose-Your-Doom RPG Adventure. Eternal slacker Murphy carelessly goes through his days until it finally catches up to him. Now you get to determine how he got to his seemingly hopeless dilemma and have some laughs at his expense.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/531100/extras/2280deea8ac1799f6a4257e651528c97.avif?t=1755612540\" width=500 height=68 /></span></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You know, when you wake up on the wrong side of the bed chained to a hexagram? It happens to everyone, right? Well, it’s happening to Murphy. The problem is he doesn’t know how he got there.  Or who might want to put him in such a predicament.  Or if those orbs are really blood red or just a mildly unsettling shade of vermilion.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This is where you come in. You see, Murphy needs help recalling all the signs and portends that may have led him to where he is now. After all, it’s not like he’s one of those heroes he may have heard about.  No. Just an unpaid intern, and not necessarily the brightest of the bunch, even. It could be that he MAY have done something. Then again, things just have a habit of HAPPENING around Murphy. Regardless, you’ll guide him through his village, through creepy back rooms of shady establishments, and through his own faulty memory to find the truth in this Adventure/RPG. Just try not to get him killed too much along the way. (Actually, we won’t fault you, if you do. That boy CAN DIE.)</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >OMINOUS! is a little comedic Choose-Your-Doom Adventure. You'll be guiding poor Murphy around as he tries to remember what happened to him (Not through any spell or anything, just bad memory). As you're guiding him around the absurd town that he lives in, uncover the many ways Murphy can die in a flashback (bad memory, remember?). It's what you do in Choose-Your-Doom. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Game Features:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >  </p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >CHOOSE your actions to reach one of the multiple endings.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >DIE a dozen deaths as Murphy tries to remember what really happened.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >EXPLORE Tycheton, a town ruled by a sadistic mayor and contains some shady areas.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >LAUGH at silly situations and fully voiced dialogue.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >PLAY carnival games that aren't always rigged.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >FIGHT badly, for you are just an intern.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >REPLAY the game's short events to unlock content reserved for later playthroughs. </p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Original Game Release 2014</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p>",
