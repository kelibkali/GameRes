    "description": "<strong>American Railroads - Summit River and Pine Valley&quot; is a first person railroad simulation</strong><br><br>Set in the steam era, at the turn of the 19th century the core game focuses expanding your transportation business.<br>Load and handle freight, build your own railroad tracks or steer and maintain your vehicles while maximizing your profits.<br><br>The game includes a variety of highly detailed and fully animated vehicles with realistic sound and behavior. Gauges, bars, levers, etc. are all interactive!<br><br>Built with the latest version of the Unity Game engine, the physics system accurately simulates the behavior of all locomotives, cars and freight just like in the real world!<br>Post processing effects like vignetting and depth of field really make your rolling stock stand out.<br><br>So grab some pieces of firewood, toss them in the boiler and set your throttle to full steam!<br><br><strong>Core features</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><strong>-</strong> Realistic transportation of logs along a scenic route </ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><strong>-</strong> Fully steerable, kinematically simulated locomotives with working Stephenson valve gear, rods, pistons, axles, bell etc. </ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><strong>-</strong> Interactable tender, cars and crane with firewood, freight and accessories</ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><strong>-</strong> Interactable switches, turntables and track</ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><strong>-</strong> Realistic vehicle sounds and particles</ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><strong>-</strong> 10 track audio soundtrack</ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><strong>-</strong> This never was, is or will be an Early Access title. It was launched in 2018 as a full title </ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><strong>-</strong> The successor to this game is called &quot;RAILROADS Online!&quot; It was built from ground up in the Unreal Engine 4 to be suited specifically for multiplayer. The multiplayer feature was the no. 1 wish of the community but could not be achieved in the Unity Engine, hence it got a separate game: &quot;Railroads Online!&quot; is availabe on Steam on 1st October 2021</ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><strong>-</strong> This was my first game ever.
