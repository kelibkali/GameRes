    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Hack greedy megacorps to help as many people as you can in a high-agility cyberpunk looter/shooter RPG. Explore vast cyberspace vistas and outmaneuver AIs to customize your loadout with an arsenal of weapon combos. Think Borderlands meets Tron. Play solo or online co-op with up to 10 people!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Black Ice is many things:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A <strong>high-mobility cyberpunk looter/shooter</strong> with an incredible number of movement and combat abilities to combo. So customizable you can even unequip your sprint and jump to replace them with more guns. After all, hacking is all about finding ways to break systems and become untouchable. But the corporations are constantly upgrading too with nearly 100 security types and unique enemies to combo against you.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A <strong>massive cyberspace open world</strong> to explore as you breach corporate AI defenses, steal their secrets (and tech!), and unravel conspiracies. Race along the information superhighway as you vault from one megacorp's gigantic neon skyscraper to another. From monumental worldbreaker megastructures to tiny hacker black markets hidden in the cracks of the world, there are endless wonders to find. Like the Phish Market.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A very human <strong>cyberPUNK story centered on helping people and building communities</strong> in a struggling corporate dystopia. Shiny cyberpunk tech is only as good as the people who use it and each person you save has skills that can be leveraged for the greater good. When the world seems bleak, all it takes is someone who can remove an obstacle when they need it most. Sometimes literally, like when someone's debt is so high that their apartment's pay-per-use door won't let them out.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Infinite customization and replay value with a <strong>progression and unlock system</strong> that adds new weapon types, dozens of <strong>unique perks</strong> that radically change your gameplay, and a very forgiving <strong>respec system</strong> so that you can always try new things.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Multiplayer and modding</strong>. You can play co-op or pvp with up to 10 friends and the enemies and loot will scale to match your group for maximum fun. Whether solo or multi, anyone can mod the game to add their own unique weapons and items. It's not a real hacking game if you can't hack the game itself!</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What else?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Extremely open development - talk to the devs directly on (some features and items were suggested by the players!)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A wonderful original soundtrack by epic composer V-Axys</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Did we mention <strong>Mod Support</strong>?</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Photosensitive Mode</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Long term support from the developers with a track record of regular updates going back to 2014!</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Promise:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Every update for free</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >No microtransactions, No DRM</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >No copyright takedowns on Let's Play videos</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Bugs fixed as fast as we can</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Things may change, but we'll always try to change them for the better</p></li></ul>",
