This game is a dream project of mine on which I'm working for several years. I work on every aspect of the game but my area of expertise is software engineering and my true passion is designing games. I'm helped by the amazing Aleksandr Makarov for all the pixel arts and by my brother and RatticusVile for the music.<br><br>For Mystical Conquests, I took a lot of inspiration from the original X-Com and his reboot, Civilization series, Age of Wonders series, Final Fantasy Tactics, Into the Breach and lots other great games.",
