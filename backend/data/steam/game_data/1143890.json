When the British commander requested permission to search the ship for deserters, the American commodore James Barron refused to muster his crew for inspection. Moments later, the captain of the Leopard responded with a barrage of broadsides, killing three Americans and wounding eighteen. British officers then proceeded to board the crippled Chesapeake and seized what they had come for: a handful of suspected deserters, including Jenkin Ratford.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >American captain Barron was suspended from the US Navy without pay for ignoring the probability of action, and Ratford met his fate hanged on the yardam of his former vessel HMS Halifax.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong></strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>About premium consumable vessels.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Premium ships cannot be captured by players or traded.
