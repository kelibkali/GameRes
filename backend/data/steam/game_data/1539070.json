    "description": "Quasimodo straps on his trusty hump one last time to rescue his paramour, the perpetually-imperiled Esmeralda, this time captured by a new villain, the horrible Halfenpounder. You must run, jump, and eat fruit (can malnutrition cause a hunched back? Can nutrition reverse it?) through a varied series of platform environments, jumping over (and atop) rolling logs that will briefly daze you if you mistime your jump and spiked pits that will, well, skewer you as surely as in the original, swinging on ropes, and signaling the end of each level by ringing an enormous bell there specifically for that purpose.",
