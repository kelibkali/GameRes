Ultimately, the greatest enemy you'll face throughout the entire experience is yourself. At a certain point it becomes a personal challenge that you will want to finish simply because you believe you can. Finishing will require your full attention, hand-eye coordination, personal determination, timing, focus, quick reaction speed and maybe a cup of coffee to perk you up. The only thing that can hold you back are your own self-doubts, personal fears and limiting beliefs. Overcome yourself, overcome XANARTHRAXIA.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1073770/extras/3bcabdef43a89cda7fabefec42c17727.avif?t=1668680010\" width=600 height=76 /></span><br><br><strong>Match 2 Combat: </strong> String together attack combos by correctly matching shapes before the enemy has a chance to react.
