Traverse unique, extremely vibrant, colorful, and magical worlds in a seamless mix of 2D and 3D platforming action. You can go it alone in single-player mode or grab a friend and team up in co-op gameplay and fight alongside Bunniguru – the giant kung-fu rabbit. And as you advance, you’ll be able to purchase new weapons and new moves, and discover countless secrets along the way.
