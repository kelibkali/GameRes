    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >High Risk is an incremental roguelike investment game where progress is never guaranteed. You bet your money, sign high-risk contracts, and move forward knowing one bad decision can wipe you out.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Bet, win… or lose everything</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Every move is a real investment. You can grow fast or collapse in seconds. There is no automatic growth and no safe path. You decide when to keep betting and when to stop to protect your gains.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Operating costs</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Staying in the game has a price. Ongoing costs slowly drain your income, forcing you to keep investing just to stay afloat. Ignoring them can ruin a strong run.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Contracts and loans</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You can sign <strong>high-risk contracts</strong> and take <strong>bank loans</strong> to accelerate your growth. Both offer powerful opportunities, but poor timing can leave you in debt or completely broke.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Upgrades</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Invest in upgrades that affect your core stats: reducing losses, scaling investments, or managing risk more effectively. They help you progress, but they never remove danger entirely.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Play your way</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You can play it safe or go all in chasing massive returns. <strong>High Risk</strong> doesn’t reward one strategy — it rewards understanding risk and living with the outcome.</p>",
