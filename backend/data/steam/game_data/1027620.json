He lives with his parents in the sleepy countryside for five years, helping them run their humble family business — while the rest of his friends leave home, and leave him behind.  <br><br>When Mitsuki finally leaves the nest, he’s twenty-three years old, and woefully behind with his studies. If he wants to get accepted into university, he’ll need to re-learn everything he was taught during high school, and then some.   </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Mitsuki moves to Tokyo to attend a rigorous cram school, with the hopes of passing his university entrance exams next spring. He soon finds, however, that his other classmates treat him like a social outcast, being the oldest at his school by far. It proves impossible to make friends, and Mitsuki consigns himself to an isolated, lonely existence...   </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >That is, until he meets the single mother, Himuro Kyouko, who just-so-happens to live in the same apartment complex as him.   </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Mitsuki offers to help Kyouko babysit her daughter, Tama.
