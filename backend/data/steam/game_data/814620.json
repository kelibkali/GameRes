    "description": "Central Intelligence is the ultimate test of your strategic skills. In this CIA style mission you can operate in three areas, Propaganda, Military, and Political, to achieve your objectives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChoose your moves carefully - you could set up a chain reaction of events that may backfire. The theater of operation is immense.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA strategic game of espionage and undercover operations with a lot of political undertones. You play a CIA chief sent to the island of Sao Madrigal, which is currently under a dictatorship. This dictatorship is supported by the Chinese government and it seriously jeopardizes the U.S.A.'s interests in the region, thus it is your mission to organize the return of democracy, by any means necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou have at your disposal a series of CIA agents divided in three branches: Political, Propaganda and Military. But the object of the game is not to organize a military uprising, but instead to support and organize the island's many opposing factions (like angry students, guerrillas, political parties,etc.) against the dictatorship (with or without their knowledge of your interventions) via propaganda, bribes, subterfuge, assassinations, blackmail, etc.",
