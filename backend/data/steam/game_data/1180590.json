The puzzle was created from the original illustration in UHD. All the details are exactly as the artist envisioned and created them. This is a puzzle of a very hard challenge even if initially it might seem as relatively easy to do. The colors are in a similar palette all across the illustration and make even different areas hard to assemble. Use the unique elements in the scene to build your frame before proceeding with the rest of the puzzle.<br><br>Also, make sure to check the other 2 puzzle boxes in the series: <strong>Witched Night</strong> and <strong>Scarecrow Watcher</strong>.",
