    "description": "<i>Have you ever heard about the Toymaker?</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story</h2><br>In Toymaker you take on the role of Pale, a goat herder, equally feared and shunned by your own people. When you were a child, the Toymaker came for you, and you made him go away. You made him flee up to his mountain, and he hasn’t been seen again since then.<br><br>But lately strange things have started to happen. The animals around the foot of the peak are moving closer and closer to the village.<br><br>The midwinter night will soon be here once more.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607780/extras/7e60ed3798bcad9435fc52cd6240afe0.avif?t=1704657391\" width=450 height=70 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Traverse a dark, twisted world unlike anything you’ve ever played before, where you can meet crafty gnomes and proud reindeer.<br></li><li>10+ hours of dynamic, ever-changing story, with much more to explore outside the well-traveled paths.<br></li><li>Fight weird things created from darkness and light, in a place where healing is never fast and wounds take a long time to mend.<br></li><li>Choose classes for your followers, to complement their strengths or to battle their weaknesses.<br></li><li>Make choices that influence the people in this world. Everyone can die, even you.

Everything is handcrafted, from graphics, to design and music. Hopefully you will enjoy the result.<br><br>Toymaker uses the classic RPG maker 2003 engine as the stone to carve its saga on. Polishing and breaking it, until something unique was made.<br><br>Thank you for your time.",
