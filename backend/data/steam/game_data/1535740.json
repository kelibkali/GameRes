    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > Candlekeep Mysteries</h2><strong> GREAT BOOKS HIDE THEIR SECRETS WELL</strong><br>Candlekeep attracts scholars like a flame attracts moths. Historians, sages, and others who crave knowledge flock to this library fortress to peruse its vast collection of books, scribbled into which are the answers to the mysteries that bedevil them. Many of these books contain their own mysteries-each one a doorway to adventure. Dare you cross that threshold?<br>Candlekeep Mysteries(TM) is a collection of seventeen short, stand-alone D&amp;D (R) adventures designed for characters of levels 1-16. Each adventure begins with the discovery of a book, and each book is the key to a door behind which danger and glory await. These adventures can be run as one-shot games, plugged into an existing Forgotten Realms (R)campaign, or adapted for other campaign settings. This book also includes a poster map of the library fortress and detailed descriptions of Candlekeep and its inhabitants.<br><i> Includes:</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Seventeen mystery-themed adventures, each focused on a single book<br></li><li>Short bite-sized content for easy consumption and preparation<br></li><li>A variety of levels of play, spanning the breadth of the game for easy adaptation<br></li><li>Usable in any D&amp;D game in or out of the Forgotten Realms</li></ul>For use with the fifth edition Player's Handbook (R) , Monster Manual (R) , and Dungeon Master's Guide (R)<br><i> Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by:</i><br><strong> Zacchaeus</strong><br><strong> Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included D&amp;D fifth edition ruleset.
