Oneirogen is a strange non-narrative 20-30 min room scale experience with gameplay elements.</strong><br><br>Oneirogen is a dreamlike circular journey through the depths of the developer's subconscious. Inspired by the writings of Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell, this surreal experience was made for room scale VR from the ground up. Flow from one environment to the next as you experience a magical trip through mysterious realms. <br><br>Spend as long as you like in each scene, there are no timers or scores. <br>No deaths, killing, or intense violence. (Safe for children)<br>No UI or menus. (Great for showing to newcomers to VR or gaming)<br>No teleportation. Built with a 3mx3m space in mind. (Limited smooth locomotion available with thumb pad/stick for smaller spaces)<br>Find the 4 hidden tokens to unlock minigames in the starting room<br><br>All proceeds support the artist to develop bigger and better and weirder VR things! <br><br><strong>&quot;Truly Transformative&quot;<br>&quot;Psychedelic and cathartic&quot;<br>&quot;Mesmerizing!&quot;</strong><br><br>Additional sound by Sara Ferret <br>Trailer music by Nicholas Andrew Sadler",
