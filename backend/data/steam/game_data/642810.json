    "description": "In this demo version of AccuRC we give you the Mikado LOGO 700 and Venlo Traffic Port scenery to get the feel of how AccuRC flies. This is a highly stripped down version with many components removed, you can fiddle with the setup to your heart's content in the workbench but flying time is limited to 5 minutes, after which you will need to restart AccuRC or purchase the full version to continue flying.<br><br>The first version of AccuRC flight simulator was released in 2014. Since then, thousands of RC pilots have been enjoying the most sophisticated and realistic aerodynamic simulation ever produced. After continuous program of free upgrades, we’re now about to release version 2.1 which makes the AccuRC available on Steam, with all the advantages of ease of access, instant availability and slimmed down supply chain, passing the savings on to you, the customer. <br><br>AccuRC offers RC fliers unique benefits unavailable with any other RC simulator.<br><br>Each and every model and component in the sim are created entirely as the original, often using CAD files from the manufacturers themselves. Here are some of the companies we have worked with in the past and are currently working with, enabling us to represent their products as accurately as possible:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>BK Designs LLC<br></li><li>Compass Models<br></li><li>GAUI TSH<br></li><li>HD Helicopters<br></li><li>KST Servos<br></li><li>Mikado USA and VTX Designs<br></li><li>Minicopter<br></li><li>MSH USA<br></li><li>OptiPower<br></li><li>SAB Heli Division<br></li><li>SAVÖX<br></li><li>Scorpion Power System Limited<br></li><li>Synergy RC<br></li><li>Velos Rotors<br></li><li>XLPower</li></ul><br>Our simulator is designed to simulate the entire model from the servos to the blades and control surfaces, with control geometries and components accurately affecting the way things feel– it's not just simply a picture of a model. Your models can be set up to individual tastes and requirements, simply by swapping electrical and mechanical components and adjusting settings as you would do with your own model. That all is done via our unique workbench area, where you can get so close to the model that you can almost smell it.<br><br>You can setup modes for training with enhanced stability options to get you started if you so require, but also for intermediate and advanced pilots who just want to have a good time making the air burn! Using our very own AH720 flybarless unit and our unique virtual transmitter, you can customize your model setups for each aircraft down to every nuance and learn how to use advanced RC equipment.<br><br>Choose from countless helicopters, fixed wing and scale aircraft, drones and quads and buggies. Flying in 3D sceneries, you can also choose from a range of camera views to customize your flying experience even further– including first person view.<br><br>AccuRC comes with super-detailed sceneries based on actual RC flying sites along with our new 3D rendered super-scape sceneries which include stadiums, adventure parks and remote islands– ideal for any flying style from helicopter 3D, aerobatics to drone racing and first person view flying.<br><br>AccuRC's super accurate aerodynamics- and physics engine ensures the most realistic and rewarding flight experience– recognized and used by many of the world's leading RC pilots.",
