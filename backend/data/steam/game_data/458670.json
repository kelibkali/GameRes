    "description": "About This Content<br />\r\n\tUnderneath the sounds of skeletons, spiders and rage from your friends lies the soundtrack for Hack, Slash &amp; Backstab. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n\tJames Zolyak is the mastermind behind it all. With a swath of midi instruments and a little keyboard, the music for this game was made, emulating the style of games from years gone by. Hopefully you enjoy giving it a listen as much as he did making the songs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe music itself is compressed into an album of MP3’s that can be played through the Stream Music player at any time. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrack List<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1.
