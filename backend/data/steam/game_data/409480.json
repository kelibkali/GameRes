    "description": "The ESCHATOS Arranged Soundtrack presents a different interpretation of ESCHATOS music from composers Yousuke Yasui and Hiroto Saitoh. With more aggressive guitar and drum instrumentation, the ESCHATOS Arranged Soundtrack is more influenced by hard rock and metal music than the original version, but still retains the catchy hooks of the original chiptune-inspired compositions.  The arranged soundtrack has also been implemented in game so you can enjoy new music while you're blasting UFOs.<br><br><strong>Contents of the AST include:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A new soundtrack integrated into the game, featuring 14 new audio tracks.  You can switch between soundtracks via the Options -&gt; Sound Settings menu in ESCHATOS.<br></li><li>Includes 16 total audio tracks in mp3 and lossless formats.  Tracks will be downloaded to your ESCHATOS Steam folder.<br></li><li>Album art and track listing are included.</li></ul><br>All arrangements by Yousuke Yasui, except Track 15 by Hiroto Saitoh.",
