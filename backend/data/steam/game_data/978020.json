Be careful though, &quot;they&quot; have unique powers and if you don't find all your memories, they will follow you to the outside.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe only exit is closed. You must collect enough Memories for it to open, even when it is opened, you may need more to survive.<br />\r\nTwo different endings based on the players ability to find what they need.<br />\r\nBased on the mindset of a character from 'Hidden Life.'<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreated by Jason Hanes.",
