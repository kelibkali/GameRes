    "description": "Composed by 2 Mello, the Sounds Of Neo-SF is the FM-synthy, funky, and positively-charged soundtrack to MidBoss' cyberpunk adventure game Read Only Memories. Not content with a soundtrack that was merely fitting for its game, 2 Mello crafted these sounds to embody the dual nature of Neo-San Francisco, all its charm and its hidden dangers. But who said that our cyberpunk future has to be dark and dreary? You'll be humming these melodies to 2064 and beyond.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTO ACCESS: find Sounds of Neo-SF - Read Only Memories OST in your music Library in Steam. Do not try to access via the Store page.",
