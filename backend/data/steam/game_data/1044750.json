Who you root for and which choices you make will determine how this story turns out, so get ready...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this illustrated interactive title, you can play through the story as either Astrid or Q. Astrid is a silver-haired, brooding customer. They are searching for a magical cure… Q is a clumsy magic-wielding shopkeep. They aren’t at all prepared for the person about to walk through their door.  The decisions you make will ultimately decide the fate of these two strangers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPerfect for anyone who loves magic, meet-cutes, and interactive, story-driven games!",
