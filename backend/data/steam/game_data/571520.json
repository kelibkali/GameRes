    "description": "<strong>Kalaban</strong> is a horror-themed action-adventure game by <strong>Rayhouse Productions</strong>. The game focuses on storytelling and open-ended gameplay.<br><br><strong>STORY:</strong><br>The year is 1995, in an alternate history version of <strong>Finland</strong>. Bob, a hermit and an American who has moved to Finland, lives in a backwater cabin by himself. One night he is attacked by a hideous dog-like mutant. Now he must find out what is going on, and discover the reason behind the outbreak.<br><br><strong>FEATURES:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li> <strong>Unique story and characters:</strong> While the game has a basic premise of mutant invasion, it also features a story with real depth and complexity. <br><br>    </li><li> <strong>Top-down action:</strong> Combat and exploration are the heart of this game. You kill monsters, gain loot and eat food to heal yourself. We wanted to make the combat fun and approachable.<br><br>    </li><li> <strong>Player choice matters:</strong> Your actions and choices affect the how the story plays out. The game can be described as an immersive sim from a top-down perspective.<br><br>    </li><li> <strong>Hand-crafted world:</strong> All the level backgrounds are unique, and the main character is completely hand-animated. We wanted to achieve a high level of polish with the art.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/571520/extras/904a0121c68da9d25ae5202cb96bef16.webp?t=1753792632\" width=400 height=31 /></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/571520/extras/5f7cd7d7c52e4ef4a144489d9fe27642.avif?t=1753792632\" width=500 height=158 /></span><br><br>For all the players looking for new releases from <strong>GameRealmMadness </strong>- <strong>ENEMY REMAINS</strong> is a punishing and action-packed continuation to Kalaban, with all new frights, foes and horrors.
