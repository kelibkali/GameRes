    "description": "The Roy game is a tower defense game where you have to keep puking zombies away from your trashcans by puking on them with captured puking zombies. You can do that by using the zombie in your hand and by placing towers that you can buy with the computer chips the zombies drop once in a while!<br />\r\nYou can also use the computer chips to upgrade your super soakers, which will damage the zombie printers.",
