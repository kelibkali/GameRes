LOC strongpoints are  a fluid gameplay and  solid graphics effects  powered by Unreal Engine.

As the tension arose, the Order has split in two factions: The stoic Alphas, and the rebels Omegas. The Omegas are considered by Alphas a sort of anarchic time’s manipulators that follow their own egoistic purposes while the Omegas  see the Alphas as cold dictators without any kind of conscience. <br><br>The consequent and unavoidable war is still in place, and his resolution could change the entire universe. <br><br>CHOOSE A FACTION AND START FIGHTING. <br><br><br>SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN (Now Available)<br><br>The Single Player Story Mode focuses on the story of Mehens, once human and now one of the fearsome Champions of Klepsydria. His goal is becoming one of the members of the High Council of Champions, but to be admitted, he must prove his valor in battle leading his team to victory.<br>During a difficult fight, Mehens had a strange vision of his old life as human, and in particular, some anguishing memories of his beloved wife Apopi, that makes him reconsider his life choices.<br>But the fights keep coming and the Eternal Conflict seems evolving in directions that the Champion could have never expected.<br><br><br>WEAPONS AND TACTICS <br><br>THE POWER OF CHAMPIONS <br><br>All Champions have incredible skills: they have access to advanced technology as well as arcane ancient knowledge, both at the same time advanced and unattainable for anyone in the universe. Since they cannot be killed, Champions have forgotten the fear for death. Finally, Champions have the ultimate power: the Leap.
