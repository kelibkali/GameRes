When a battle is initiated, the game switches to Battle mode - and your troops appear on a battle map awaiting your orders.<br>Use tactics to your advantage, use swift moving cavalry to attack your enemy from the rear, or cheap disposable peasants to keep your enemy occupied while you deal with their bowmen. <br><br>Be careful! Once your troops are engaged in melee it will be hard to disengage them. <br>Just like a real battle, your soldiers can become tired (dropping their speed), or become overwhelmed with fear, forcing them to flee the battlefield.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/996050/extras/a7ba9ccd1a1d8325db12984c1140fd10.avif?t=1558083776\" width=500 height=350 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The World</h2>The worlds in Chieftain are made up of scores of nations from 7 distinct races.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/996050/extras/f2753a9f217b15b693c005d12030cd0d.avif?t=1558083776\" width=500 height=350 /></span><br>Humans have inhabited these lands since days immemorial. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/996050/extras/43349cbf0f54d233eff57f70562292fc.avif?t=1558083776\" width=500 height=350 /></span><br>Goblins are an evil, hunchbacked race of demons.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/996050/extras/9955380fac764568d07b03f7708d6567.avif?t=1558083776\" width=500 height=350 /></span><br>The Kioha are a tribe of undead, spawns from the nethers of Hell.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/996050/extras/74ada88aca981cdbcbd0cc4f38c16999.avif?t=1558083776\" width=500 height=350 /></span><br>Freyja are an odd entity originally from the snow-lands. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/996050/extras/1d7b5de905469c8f6588723a6c108953.avif?t=1558083776\" width=500 height=350 /></span><br>Draco are cold-hearted lizard-serpents. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/996050/extras/533fa5a9aebf4bb4776fdfc9ccff2788.avif?t=1558083776\" width=500 height=350 /></span><br>A race of beasts of burden, the Vacca are tough warriors.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/996050/extras/c07e86c28473e9673fe272862374c879.avif?t=1558083776\" width=500 height=350 /></span><br>Cunning and sly, the Lupin are a wolf-like creature.",
