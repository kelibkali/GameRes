Can you, as the Allied commander, clear the way through the dense forests and rolling hills to secure a jump off point for the final drive to the Rhine? Or will you, as the German commander, successfully delay the Allied advance and make them pay in blood for every meter of the fatherland that falls into their hands?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p>",
