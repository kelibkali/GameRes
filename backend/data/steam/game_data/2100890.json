    "description": "Marble Smashers is a 3D fighting game for 2-4 players where the goal is to knock out your opponents off the stage and be the last one standing. You must attack other opponents to knock them away, but watch out! The more you get attacked, the easier it is to be thrown off. In each stage, you may find objects that help you with your objective.<br><br>Battle your friends face-to-face in local play sessions, or fight players around the world in online matches!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Join our Discord server</h2><br><br>This demo contains two stages from the main game: Marble Island and Smasher Ring. Some customization options are also available for players to experiment with and get a taste of what the full version contains.",
