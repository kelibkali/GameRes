    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i><strong>Our Dying World</strong></i> is a heartfelt throwback to classic RPGs—crafted for players who love deep characters, meaningful choices, and a world that reacts to what you do. It’s got old-school soul with modern comforts, and a story that won’t let go.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Key Features</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Uncover a World on the Brink</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The land of Elorant is unraveling. Magic—the very lifeblood of all living things—is fading from the world. As Max, a new adventurer, join strong, unforgettable companions and dig into a mystery that could change everything… or end it all. <br><br><br><i>Choose Who You Become</i><br><br>Your decisions don’t just shape the story—they shape <i>you</i>. Will you choose to walk a path of hope, despair, or something in between? Every decision you make culminates in wild twists, hard choices, and an emotional journey that pulls on that RPG nostalgia while being entirely new.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i></i><br><i>Power Up with the Boost System</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >From sewer rats to cosmic nightmares, every fight is a chance to turn the tide! Use the Boost mechanic to shatter enemy defenses, stack your power, and unleash brutal finishing blows when it counts most.<br><br><br><i>Build Bonds That Matter</i><br><br>These aren’t just party members—they’re your friends. Laugh with them. Fight with them. Learn what they’re afraid of, and what they’d die for. Strengthen your bonds to unlock powerful new abilities (and maybe call in an old enemy or two to fight by your side).<br><br><br><i>Explore Every Hidden Corner</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >If it looks suspicious, it could be hiding something valuable. Secret caves, suspicious waterfalls, ancient sewer tunnels--treasure and terror alike are tucked into every crevice. Just be prepared for what you might find… and what might find you.</p>",
