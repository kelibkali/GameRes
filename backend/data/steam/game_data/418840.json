    "description": "In the year 20XX a confident, young horologist by the name of Strike is inadvertently transported into the past while attempting to repair a mysterious, abandoned clock tower. Endeavoring to return to the future, Strike must fix both the time machine and the island’s dysfunctional family who are responsible for much of the clock’s disrepair.<br><br>As the spiritual successor to Cat Poke, Tick Tock Isle plays like a puzzle platform game that relies heavily on story, character interaction, creative thinking, and poking.‬<br><br>The music and sfx are by Kevin Carville.",
