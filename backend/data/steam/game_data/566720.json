    "description": "The Following Portents video commentary offers a two and a half hour insight into the development of the first issue of Half-Life: A Place in the West.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNarrated by co-creators Mike Pelletier and Ross Joseph Gardner, the video commentary takes viewers through the entirety of the first issue, exploring the conception of each scene - from the first drafts of the script, through to the pencils, the inks, and ultimately to the final product. We critically discuss early story ideas, character development, and the general experience of working on a comic book for the first time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to being a behind-the-scenes look at the production of Issue 1, we also include and discuss never before seen content, such as pages that were scrapped, and excerpts from earlier drafts of the script.",
