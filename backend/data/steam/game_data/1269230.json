Winters are beautiful here and full of life. Summers bring harsh storms, but I take cover in a cave with my flock and the storms pass. So, life was good, but recently there have been shining eyes in the night and noises I’ve never heard before. What are they? Could you become one of us and help me to find out what they are?</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Character profile:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Height: ~3 feet (1 meter)<br></li><li>Favorite food: Date, palm fruits<br></li><li>Combat skills: Vicious bite</li></ul><br>Dodo Adventures is a VR adventure game that can be played with Valve Index, HTC Vive devices, Oculus Rift and Oculus Rift S headsets.
