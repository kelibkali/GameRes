Probably.</h2><br>Tank Maniacs is a chaotic local multiplayer couch party game for one to four players. You and your fellow pilots will battle it out in post-apocalyptic arenas reminiscent of the once beautiful landscapes of our planet. Your task is simple: eliminate the competition in any way possible. To ensure the unfairness of these encounters, the showrunner will bombard you with environmental hazards and powerful upgrades that can turn the tide of battle in a heartbeat. <br><br>Engage in free-for-all or team-based combat with friends, or try beating the unforgiving AI bots. If you want to be successful in the arena, you’ll have to master the weird tanks with various gameplay mechanics and familiarize yourself with the different maps that offer a wide range of challenges. Or you can just shoot your friends to bits, that’s fine too.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1046630/extras/1ddc086f3e145073103e4fa4de6b3655.poster.avif?t=1589708661\" width=620 height=178 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1046630/extras/1ddc086f3e145073103e4fa4de6b3655.webm?t=1589708661\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1046630/extras/1ddc086f3e145073103e4fa4de6b3655.mp4?t=1589708661\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Main features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Couch madness for up to 4 players<br></li><li>8 beautiful levels with unique features <br></li><li>11 wonderfully weird tanks (including the Thanksgiving “Turkey Tank”)!<br></li><li>12 wacky characters<br></li><li>4 game modes + team based variations<br></li><li>Dynamic commentary<br></li><li>Unforgiving AI bots<br></li><li>Twitch integration with in-game voting<br></li><li>Fun, cartoony art style with hand-drawn graphics<br></li><li>Punchy electro-rock soundtrack</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Steam Remote Play </h2><br>Tank Maniacs was born to be enjoyed by your friends on your side, so you can laugh in their faces when you beat them.

After the Post-Nuclear War most of the population is gone. A brilliant man called the ‘Showrunner’ created Tank Maniacs to be the main source of entertainment for the remaining folk. He’s selected the most infamous veterans and exotic warrior creatures from all over the world to have them fight in his carefully designed arenas. They’re kept in his city-sized zeppelin with a fully functioning tank factory inside until they’re ready for a match.<br><br>Pilots may fight in the most imaginative and peculiar arenas from all over the Post-Nuclear world.
