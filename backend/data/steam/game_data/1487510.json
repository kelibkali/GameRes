    "description": "The Official Soundtrack for Monster Camp captures the game’s beautiful chaotic energy. A handful of kick-ass surf-rock tracks that will get you ready to party. <br />\r\nBut that’s not all! This soundtrack also includes all our recent experimentation in music. Change the vibes by listening to some of the songs translated into chiptune or even Gregorian chants. <br />\r\nAh, Gregorian chants, the music genre you didn’t know you NEEDED.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe also spiced the soundtrack up with some lo-fi beats. Because you never know when you may need to relax/study. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd finally, the two weirdest pieces of this already weird display of musical beauty: a song full of anime vibes that celebrate our favorite buff blue goddess, and an original song we created to prevent content creators from getting their videos taken down.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Monster Camp Official Soundtrack is composed by Claudi Martinez.",
