Like any other perfectly normal school, its students and faculty are going missing and the classrooms have been locked down for weeks. Yes, there's nothing remarkable happening at WFHS whatsoever - just ask the new principal.<br><br>Things are bound to get stirred up when an enthusiastic, bizarrely dressed new kid wanders into town. This go-getter's name is Daryl, and he just wants to make friends. What starts out as an innocent effort to help jump-start a young contraband textbook business turns into a harrowing quest through the school and its enormous, monster-filled classrooms in the hope of becoming the most popular kid in town. Oh - and saving everyone's lives is top priority, of course.<br><br>No need to worry. There's nothing to see here at Water Falls High School.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Cartoon violence - buy and upgrade over 40 skills to make the kills!<br></li><li>Hundreds of characters like Julius Caesar, Mozart, and the janitor!<br></li><li>A sumptuous open world featuring scads of maps!<br></li><li>More than 15 hours of story with minimal plot holes!<br></li><li>Discover secrets instead of completing the story!<br></li><li>Talk to strangers and run their errands in exchange for sweet loot!<br></li><li>Don fancy equipment like a Dunce Cap or the Super Weenie Sword!<br></li><li>Legendary soundtrack with tunes ranging from creepy to rock opera!</li></ul><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/361230/extras/b3babfd08439fcb03aaba8a56011dcc3.avif?t=1572319516\" width=671 height=319 /></span>",
