    "description": "Neonverse defenders is a retro-futuristic 3D Tower Defense game.<br />\r\nThe aim of this game is to bring a new dimension to the Tower Defense genre.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven existing games in full 3D are still confined to two dimensions in their gameplay. <br />\r\nThe third dimension is really something to take into account in the placement of your towers as their range will also cover up/down axis.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nWith Neonverse Defenders, there is a will to change the standard layout of Tower Defense games to bring new fun. <br />\r\nExpect some maps to be really crazy and destabilising, even for Tower Defense veterans. <br />\r\nSome others will be really hard to figure out the best way to beat it.​<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game also delivers a better control on towers behavior by allowing the player to define two targeting preferences (in a huge list of possibilities), resulting in interesting strategic choices. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGraphics are inspired by both futuristic elements, and retro style. <br />\r\nIt’s like an imaginary future world created in the eighties, full of colors and strange shapes. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, expect the story to be a little bit more entertaining than the traditional: “Enemies are coming, destroy them”. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, the game offers different possibilities of improvement like experience, talent tree, and reset bonus. <br />\r\nPrepare to chose which one suit your playstyle more.",
