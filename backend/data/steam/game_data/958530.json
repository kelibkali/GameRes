Dracula has a host of tricks and traps up his sleeves, to misdirect and hide from the hunters - but the hunters are armed with plenty of tools too! Each hunter provides a new way to play, with unique stats and abilities to aid them in the fight against this ancient evil.<br><br>Dracula himself has a range of unholy powers to call upon, allowing him to transform and enthral humans, along with transforming into a bat or mist in order to escape the hunters.<br><br>Once the hunters and Dracula finally clash, bloody and gruesome combat ensues. Nobody is safe as Dracula lashes out at his pursuers, and the hunters battle against the inhuman and immortal Count. Featuring a card-based combat system that rewards bluffing and tactical choices, no two clashes are the same.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/958530/extras/1c7ce17eb97c27c5c0e0b6cd35e958b1.poster.avif?t=1760518039\" width=616 height=220 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/958530/extras/1c7ce17eb97c27c5c0e0b6cd35e958b1.webm?t=1760518039\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/958530/extras/1c7ce17eb97c27c5c0e0b6cd35e958b1.mp4?t=1760518039\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Feature List:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Detailed Tutorial</strong> Designed with care, our in-depth tutorials will walk you through everything you need to know to start your hunt.<br></li><li><strong>A Faithful Adaptation</strong> Based on the 4th Edition of the physical game, Fury of Dracula: Digital Edition recreates the iconic board game in its entirety.<br></li><li><strong>Multiple Game Modes</strong> Choose from battling against the AI, teaming up with friends locally or taking the hunt global with up to five players in online battles.<br></li><li><strong>Detailed Card Library</strong> Browse everything Fury of Dracula has to offer in our detailed library, including character, combat and event cards to prepare yourself.<br></li><li><strong>Haunting Animations</strong> The artwork from the original board game bursts to life with beautiful and bloody animations for every single piece.<br></li><li><strong>A Chilling Soundtrack</strong> Composed and created from the ground up for Fury of Dracula: Digital Edition, this soundtrack is sure to send chills down your spine - also available as a standalone purchase!</li></ul>",
