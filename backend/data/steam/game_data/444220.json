The story follows our hero John, who is a veteran, trying to do amends in his screw up life and he only has his space ship AI, who still cares about him. The story latter unfolds some pretty interesting things about John, his life and his relationship with stuff around him.  <br>The game itself is based on a dodging/blowing up stuff, but that quickly falls in background picture, since you have to outmaneuver the enemy, who are constantly changing. Your job is to save planets from incoming asteroids, while taking care of your affairs with other bounty hunters.  <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/444220/extras/5c75d161629d7b5493f398b6090b355f.avif?t=1613073758\" width=600 height=66 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>unique boss fights with different difficulty levels <br></li><li>defend the nearby planets from vicious asteroids attacks <br></li><li>battle other bounty hunters </li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/444220/extras/65900edfde277d37419fa4ed2d66a468.avif?t=1613073758\" width=600 height=66 /></span><br><br>The concept of the game is to farm experience, so you can unlock new upgrades.
