Take the wind into account when choosing a faraway target. Learn to aim quickly, as your muscles will eventually tire out, making it increasingly difficult to aim. And if your target moves too quickly or is too far away - use your sharpened senses to temporarily make shooting easier and faster.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1374440/extras/7327bfac9ed64facd3ac6b48eeb232dd.poster.avif?t=1671525330\" width=600 height=300 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1374440/extras/7327bfac9ed64facd3ac6b48eeb232dd.webm?t=1671525330\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1374440/extras/7327bfac9ed64facd3ac6b48eeb232dd.mp4?t=1671525330\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Sign up for increasingly prestigious tournaments in various different locations.
