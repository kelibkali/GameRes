    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Meander's Map Pack: Idlewilds</h2>The fifth installment in the Fantasy Grounds Meanders Map Pack series offers a huge varied expansion 30 Map set to the existing four sets as well as all-new terrain and convenient tactical and story-based features carefully selected to maximise utility with existing combinations, enhance and deepen your visual continuity and offer a huge range of new tactical scenarios and encounters<br>This pack is an official Fantasy Grounds module release and contains 30 Mixed-Themed maps sized specially for FG at 1350x900 and under 500 kb each to help prevent slow-down during play. [Fantasy Grounds runs best on maps that are 2000x2000 pixels or less and under 1mb]. The maps are sized to perfectly fit a 50 or 60px grid that you can manually place over the top of the map using Fantasy Grounds - see 'Hot Tips' in the Story Section of this module once you have unzipped and added the module to FG for help on doing that.<br>From opening up the Sea with an Ocean Map and allowing DM's to edge five core terrain types to the sea, players are now less land-locked. Shipwreck them on a Reef, float them in the High Wave Swell and join to (or depart from) a wide variety of new terrain types including Arctic Tundra, Marsh, Savannah, Alpine Mountains and Grassplains. Have them delve into all-new Jungle Ruins or inspect an Archaeological Dig Site, Visit a Hobbit Hillside or Journey to a Valley of Giant Crystals. Emphasis has been placed on providing interesting entrances/exits into and out of maps and the ability to transition deeper with a selection of Temple, Cave and Castle Exteriors -and - maps to suit the interiors such as a Crypt, Mine or Castle Courtyard. Let the roads and rivers of previous sets combine with these new meanders to lead your adventurers to exciting new destinations pre-sized and displayed for optimal selection with the now standard addition of Random Map Roll Tables and 21 Adventure Seeds. In addition it features a VISUAL MAP SELECTION PANEL for quick-selecting, a RANDOM MAP ROLL TABLE and a random table with 21 JUNGLE-THEMED ADVENTURE SEEDS with a new Map Suggestions feature to get you started.<br>Join the maps together or encounter them one by one - it's up to you. Users can opt to load/lay the maps manually and build a custom layout - or use a combination of Time-lapse, Role-play and/or the supplied Random Roll Table to determine when maps are used and where adventurers end up.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong></strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and any ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
