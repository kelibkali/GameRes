    "description": "They just killed Cash. Now, they want to kill him again. <br />\r\n <br />\r\nAmerica is full of run down, broken rust-belt towns where nobody cares and anything goes. In Carcer City, nothing matters anymore and all that's left are cheap thrills. The ultimate rush is the power to grant life and take it away, for sport. This time James Earl Cash, you are the sport. They gave you your life back. Now, they are going to hunt you down. <br />\r\n <br />\r\nYou awake to the sound of your own panicked breath. You must run, hide and fight to survive. If you can stay alive long enough, you may find out who did this to you. <br />\r\n <br />\r\nThis is a brutal blood sport.",
