    "description": "Dragon Mine is a game about gold miner who is trapped in the gold mine with unknown creatures: some are neutral, some are aggressive, some are annoying. Go through the numerous mazes and try to get to the cave full of gold waiting at the end, but remember - the journey won't be easy. Think fast and move precisely to get to the exit - any delay may result in the escape portal to be covered with mysterious water, blocking your way out.",
