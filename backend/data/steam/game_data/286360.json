    "description": "Visiting Rome from Chicago, where he works as a doctor, ex-priest James Murphy answers a mysterious call for help from his friend Cristoforo. The disappearance of a briefcase containing compromising documents is enough to convince James that his friend is a victim of something shady and sinister. The Vatican's involvement and some strange parallels with his own traumatic past inspire James to get to the bottom of this mystery. <br><br>Along this dangerous and disturbing path, James finds the most unlikely travelling companion who will question his deepest beliefs. And so the two characters begin both a physical journey in search of the truth, and a metaphysical exploration of the inner soul and the darkest secrets that everyone hides, even a &quot;champion of the faith&quot; like James. <br><br>Rome is the stage for this adventure – a city bathed in eternal twilight, its skies tinted the color of blood spilled in more than thirty years of intrigue: blood of innocents and guilty, unknown and famous victims alike.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >KEY FEATURES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Shadows on the Vatican is a thrilling new point-and-click adventure in 4 acts, inspired by real events in recent Italian history and freely adapted from the bestseller of David Yallop &quot;In God's Name&quot;. <br></li><li>Art direction by Lorenzo Ruggiero (Marvel/DC Comics)<br></li><li>Over 10 locations per episode with high resolution graphics and Full HD support<br></li><li>Realistic characters with hours of motion-capture animations<br></li><li>Well integrated puzzles and several hours of gameplay<br></li><li>Animated coloured comics by award winner Daniela di Matteo</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286360/extras/dfafe8aa7e092ea1aa286096001a02ad.avif?t=1762870412\" width=616 height=108 /></span>",
