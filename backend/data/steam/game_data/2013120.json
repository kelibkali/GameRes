    "description": "«Where to, army man? Want to visit Kuznetsk? Yes, I can drive you till the road to it, but I cannot go there. The visits are forbidden. It is a weird place. There was an accident there few years ago, so they control anyone who vants to visit the town. I bring the goods to local market weekly, using special pass from government. But, you know, I have a weird feeling about that place – it seems like it stuck in the past, like a fly in amber. Also, that creepy lake near town – they call it Darkness or something. No one swims in there, even in the hottest summer – locals think it is cursed. »<br><br><i>This game is a Visual Novel in detective genre, with an original plot, and anime-style graphics.
