With the help of his friend and caretaker, Carmen, the two must go out and fight against aliens who have sprung from the Bermuda Triangle and are terrorizing the surrounding area.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTropi has a variety of weapons under his disposal, all very different from each other. Don't try to fire aimlessly though. You need to understand that each weapon needs to be reloaded after a certain number of shots get fired.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTropi attempts to add a certain amount of variety and strategy that is not present in many other shooters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWill be released whenever it's ready.",
