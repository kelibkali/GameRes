    "description": "<i> <strong> Jetpack Astronaut </strong> </i> - 2D indie game with arcade elements, made in stylized graphics.<br>Here you need to control an astronaut with a certain amount of lives and energy. The goal is to get through space and its various obstacles (black holes, comets) to the power unit. Collecting coins along the way, you can upgrade the astronaut for them by buying him new suits that simplify the passage of the levels. This is a very calm and relaxing game that doesn't require much thought. Just relax and enjoy the atmosphere of space adventure with pleasant music in the background.",
