Will he make it out alive? Or will he fall into a pit of lava and <strong>DIE</strong>- I mean... be defeated? Find out by playing through this unforgettable interactive action adventure designed to <strong>BLOW YOU AWAY WITH A</strong> <i>metaphorical</i> <strong>9MM HANDGUN</strong> of ground-breaking video-game-play!<br><br>Anti-Jump-Man is an abstract experimental platformer where the main character sucks at jumping (good luck trying to beat it if it didn't have some sort of gimmick to it, ha!). I would keep on describing what the game is like in here, but Anti-Jump-Man is a game that speaks for itself. And besides, data shows most players don't  even bother with reading this description, so congratulations for doing so! You are special and one of a kind! :-)<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br>* The Bridge Gun: A cool gun that lets you place your own platforms on the levels<br>* A short and sweet single-player story<br>* Stylized, mostly monochromatic retro pixel-art graphics reminiscent of when you were a kid (aka when videogames were awesome!) as seen through a deliberately ugly chromatic-aberration-riddled mess of a display!<br>* 2nd place winner of 2018's Uruguayan National Videogame Contest",
