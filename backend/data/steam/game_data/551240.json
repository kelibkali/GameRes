    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Savage Worlds Setting: Slipstream</h2>Setting and Library Module for Fantasy Grounds II<br>updated on 12/17/11 to include a custom Slipstream, sci-fi skin and theme<br>Welcome to Slipstream<br>Slipstream is a space pulp setting reminiscent of the black and white Saturday morning<br>serials of the 1930s. Put aside all foolish thoughts of such things as the immutable<br>laws of physics, Faster-Than-Light drives, and the hard vacuum of space, and revel<br>in the rocketship and ray gun reality that governs Slipstream. If youre looking<br>for a hard sci-fi game, youre reading the wrong book!<br>Getting Here<br>Slipstream is a pocket universe reached only by passage through a black hole. Every<br>black hole in our universe has a branch tunnel to Slipstream. Conventional 21st<br>century science has it that matter sucked into a black hole is destroyed; not even<br>light can escape the terrible force of destruction. Well, conventional science isnt<br>always right.<br>What You Get<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>GM library module<br></li><li>Player library module<br></li><li>Custom extension<br></li><li>56 New Edges which can be dragged onto characters or NPCs<br></li><li>18 New Hindrances which can be dragged onto characters or NPCs<br></li><li>Details on new gear: low-tech gear, high-tech gear, rocket ships, vehicles<br></li><li>New Psionics, New Races, Rules for generating your own races<br></li><li>A Gazeteer with detail on more than 50 worlds<br></li><li>Stats from more than 100 new personalities<br></li><li>17 Savage Tales and a Savage Tale Generator<br></li><li>Much more</li></ul><strong>Requires: </strong>The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the Savage Worlds<br>v3 Ruleset<br><strong>Fantasy Grounds Conversion:</strong> Kevin Doswell<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Kevin Doswell</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
