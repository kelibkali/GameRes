    "description": "<strong><i>Iron Meat</i></strong> is a fast-paced, run-and-gun shooter that immerses players in a world overrun by The Meat--an all-consuming interdimensional biomass. With a mix of classic arcade and console mechanics, players will battle against mutated victims and machines, dodge bullet barrages, and crush bosses in nine levels of gore-ific brutality. As Vadim, fight back against The Meat and stop the terrors spawned from scientist Yuri Markov's experiments on the Moon.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1157740/extras/1770c964a71a2f46bb71028a73db751b.poster.avif?t=1733424742\" width=620 height=220 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1157740/extras/1770c964a71a2f46bb71028a73db751b.webm?t=1733424742\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1157740/extras/1770c964a71a2f46bb71028a73db751b.mp4?t=1733424742\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >MULTI-PHASE BOSS FIGHTS</h2><i>Iron Meat</i> pays homage to classic run-and-gun titles from the past, with intense boss fights fixed into multiple phases.

Hell, you don't even have to be a HUMAN to do so! With over 30 unlockable skins to choose from, players can customize their character the way they want. Each skin comes with interchangeable parts, allowing for greater customization with mixing and matching. Want a shark head on a robot body with dinosaur feet? DONE. Maybe a half human, half doggo? YOU BET! Or how about a cowboy with a tail and demon wings?
