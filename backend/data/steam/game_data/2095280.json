MeCopy was programmed using Python and compiled using Nuitka. The Nuitka compiler results in an executable .exe file which is detected by many antivirus as a malicious file and is out of our hands and it is up to the Nuitka team to fix it. We are in communication with antivirus companies to add MeCopy to their whitelist. Some give us an answer and others don't, so if you want to collaborate with us in this matter you can send us an email indicating your antivirus along with the warning it gives you, this will help us a lot. Also given the nature of MeCopy, which is to copy and delete files from the system, Windows can get a little alert, but as we said at the beginning, you can ignore these warnings and use the software with total tranquility.<br><br>If you have any questions or problems, do not hesitate to contact us at our email address<br><br><br>-It is important that your operating system is completely updated. If you have problems starting MeCopy, verify that you have the latest version of your OS. If you have <strong>Windows 7</strong> , you will need the system update  <strong>KB3063858</strong>, which can be found in the 'Pre-requisites' folder, located inside the MeCopy installation folder.<br><br><strong>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\MeCopy\\Pre-requisites</strong></li></ul>",
