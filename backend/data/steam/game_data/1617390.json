With that being said:<br><br>This is a SHORT exploration game. Please go into this game expecting to spend your time exploring. This game is an exploration game that explores dark themes. You will need to interpret the text in the game to your own degree. With that being said this game is more of an art than an interactive experience and we hope you enjoy.<br><br>Wake up in the shoes of Flo, a 19-year-old, and explore a strange and wonderful world. You can only access this strange world through Flo's nonfunctional computer. The more you explore, the more of the truth behind the world you will find... but be wary: You only have 1 Week to find out what's really going on!<br><br>FLOW, at its core, is an exploration psychological horror game. You go behind the scenes of Flo's mind. This gives the game a very bleak and foreboding atmosphere. Explore a mysterious world filled with brightly colored enemies, and discover a forgotten history by navigating through the lively and mundane.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1617390/extras/85317aeffda55637a194279459a7908f.avif?t=1688497297\" width=500 height=500 /></span><br><br><strong>CREDITS:</strong><br>Dallen Larson / Adam Helquist / jijigri / Lucas Ferreira",
