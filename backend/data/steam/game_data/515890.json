Jump into the role of Marty, a small robot on a journey to find his creator. With the aid of time travel, Marty is able to step through time and work together with past versions of himself to overcome any challenge. In the game, you are presented with challenges that require multiple people working together to succeed. Time travel will allow you to work with up to 5 of your past selves to overcome these challenges that a single player could never overcome alone. In this way, puzzles will be set up so you must play out partial solutions to a puzzle, then go back in time and play out remaining parts to unlock the solution. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/515890/extras/598c6a6201d3a38a0559718096801842.avif?t=1739857718\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><br>Marty Thinks 4D focuses on small puzzle areas, similar to what you may find in games such as Swapper or Talos Principal, only the stages will be seen from an isometric top down angle. In each stage you will be challenged to work your way to the exit with increasingly complex stages. Multiple Marty robots must coordinate their efforts and overcome challenges such as defeating enemies, platforming, and activating objects. In the game you will be using a variety of special abilities, each with unique purposes.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/515890/extras/74264bec8b6475d3e6f7dc1e146bcb1e.avif?t=1739857718\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><br>The game will take place over 5 chapters, starting with Marty awakening inside his factory. His creator (Dr. Mobious) has long since passed, and Marty has been trapped in an isolated existence, continually performing final commands of his late master. Marty determines that, without his creator, his life lacks true purpose... So he sets off on an adventure to rebuild his creator and discover where he fits in the wide universe. In the story, Marty learns about the human condition and the true fate of Dr. Mobius. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/515890/extras/c852adbe92b18b1d6859c571621dc755.avif?t=1739857718\" width=561 height=89 /></span><br><br>Marty Thinks 4D features 50 stages, boss fights, power-ups, voice acting, a custom sound track and the ability to customize your Marty.
