There are a few types of cards:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Quest Cards - that's your main goal for the run. These cards have their own difficulty level and requirements for your deck to use them. <br></li><li> Room Cards - special rooms that will be added to the dungeon. Like a shop where you can buy powerups. <br></li><li> Dungeon Cards - each dungeon card adds one dungeon floor with all the special rooms. Each of the Dungeon Cards represents a different location. Special rooms may be acting differently depending on the dungeon that you are in.<br></li><li> Item Cards - your starting items in the run. You can find more items in the dungeon of course, but at least you can choose how you would like to start.<br></li><li> Upgrade Cards - changing and upgrading other cards or mechanics in the dungeon.</li></ul><br>Each card has its cost, which you pay - fighting enemies. Each fight is harder than the previous one so you have to choose wisely.<br>Some cards have special requirements that have to be met in order to use them. <br>Each one of the Quests is a unique challenge that you can customize as you wish.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Story</h2><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1335520/extras/261f3c0b1169c5a5b17ff965e7639627.avif?t=1769105165\" width=636 height=314 /></span><br>You are Sirius.
