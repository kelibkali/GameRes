    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A turn-based slotting in / strategy game with a BIG twist!</h2><br><br>Play either solo (un-timed, or against the clock, or even the addictive new BLITZ!, LIMITED MOVES, and PUZZLE modes!), or against up to 3 CPU *or* Human players.<br><br>Take turns to place your pieces onto the board, trying to score the maximum points you can with your current piece, each turn. (and in TIMED modes, in as fast a time as you can for bonus points, and be quick! - or you may lose your turn...)<br><br>BIG points are not the ONLY way to play the game - you can also play sneakily (as well as strategically) too, to stop your opponents from getting a better score, or force the end of the game by blocking potential moves by your opponents! - Once the board is exhausted, if enabled, a one-time DOWNFALL can turn the tide, and create a few more moves!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >CURRENTLY FEATURES!:-</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Tetraminos - but used in a never-before-seen way to strategically play / fight for the highest score/best move!<br></li><li>A selection of over 100 (so far!) unique board layouts already included to play on already (with more being added, up to the planned limit of nearly 500, including the best from the community!)<br></li><li>A built-in Level Editor! - A layout creation editor is already included inside the game, to amend or create up to 500 of your own layouts/levels to play immediately, or even for submission, community rating and incorporation into regular (and of course, *FREE*) extra levels packs coming soon!).<br></li><li>Some VERY sneaky CPU opponents - 21 of them, to be exact!  ;)<br></li><li><strong><u>VERSUS STANDARD</u></strong> (Human or CPU opponents), RELAXED or TIMED game mode - Try to beat your friends (or the CPU players!) on any given level!<br></li><li><strong><u>SOLO STANDARD RELAXED</u></strong> or TIMED game mode - Try to beat your best efficiency/scores for any given level!<br></li><li><strong><u>SOLO BLITZ MODE!</u></strong> - Try to get the best scores for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 or 10 minutes on the clock, with more time being awarded for GREAT scoring moves!<br></li><li><strong><u>SOLO LIMITED MOVES MODE!</u></strong> - Try to get the best scores for a starting amount of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80 or 100 MOVES, with free moves being awarded for GREAT scoring moves!<br></li><li>*NEW!* <strong><u>SOLO PUZZLE MODE!</u></strong> - Try to completely complete each of the 90+ unique PUZZLE mode layouts, by cleverly placing your allocated pieces without leaving yourself stuck before you reach 20 remaining empty tile slots! - Great for a relaxed diversion from the standard TetraLogical number crunching gameplay! - Leaderboard rankings are also given for a completed puzzle, and if you've complete it quickly, you may well find you have the top spot!<br></li><li>SOCIAL/COMPETITIVE mode - Try to beat your friends and a selection of 21 (so far) intelligent CPU opponents with varying skill levels and styles of play.<br></li><li>Music Jukebox and a selection of 14 superb music tracks from SKAVEN to play along to, for added ambience!<br></li><li>Once-per-game, end game DOWNFALL, to mix the endgame up a bit, in STANDARD MODE (Active all of the time in BLITZ and LIMITED MOVES modes!).<br></li><li>Includes a HUGE selection (1,000's!) of Leaderboards to challenge, and already has almost 100 *meaningful* Stats &amp; Achievements for skillful playing included, some easier, some harder, some VERY hard to get (and some just plain quirky / thinking outside the box!), and CPU beating! (the final game will feature around 200 *meaningful* achievements to get, with a few of the quirkier ones being hidden until achieved!)</li></ul><br>...More to be added, along with many more game modes!<br><br>Give it a try! - If you love strategy or puzzle games, cerebral challenges, either SOLO or beating your friends or the computer on them, I think you'll like it as it stands, and certainly with what I intend to add to it!",
