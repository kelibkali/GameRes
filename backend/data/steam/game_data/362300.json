    "description": "<strong>WHAT IS A TEST SERVER?:</strong><br>The Just Survive Test Server allows players to help us evaluate and test the newest items, systems and gameplay in Just Survive before they are patched to the main servers.  Your feedback is invaluable as we continue to create this awesome game!  Please note that as with Early Access, you can expect bugs, crashes and play interruptions on this new content.”<br><br>In Just Survive, the zombie virus has crippled civilization. Corrupted by the need to survive, gone are the comforts of society as a new normal permeates the world. You are one of the last remaining humans. Every choice matters, every moment is borrowed time, and every breath could be your last.  If you don’t want to join the dead -- or the undead -- you’ll have to be cutthroat, resourceful, and alert at all times. Scavenge, craft, and build to protect yourself from zombies, roaming beasts, and perhaps the deadliest threat of all – fellow humans. Do you have what it takes to Just Survive?<br><br>Visit the Just Survive website  for more info!",
