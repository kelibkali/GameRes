    "description": "It's a game about finding your way out of the miserable world which we live in and understanding that none of it makes sense we are all just meat bags walking around and destroying something that took millions of years to create itself. Oh and this game has a killer soundtrack also.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat you will have to do is to help your golem buddy to find a way out of the labyrinths with the spectacular landscape. It might seem easy at the first look, but I can promise you that this will be one of the longest and most interesting journeys of your life.",
