    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Imagine arriving at a movie premiere in the 1940s. Ten minutes later, the main actor is shot under the spotlight by accident… or maybe on purpose?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Luckily, you are <strong>Thomas Ireham</strong>, a famous detective who can rewind time.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You jump back to your arrival and try to solve the case <i>before it even happens</i>. But it won’t be easy. The guest list is long, the venue is huge, and some areas are completely inaccessible. So you rewind time again. And again. Each loop teaches you something new.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >People move. Conversations change. Events unfold whether you’re ready or not. Some moments help you. Others work against you. Time keeps moving — even when you stop to think. By rewinding the final ten minutes over and over, you slowly piece together the truth. Where people go. What they know. What only happens if you’re in the right place at the right moment.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This demo offers restricted access to a <strong>complete, feature-length detective story</strong> built around observation, deduction, and understanding how the evening really works.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Demo Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Play with the full core systems and mechanics from the complete game</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Interrogate the entire cast of characters</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Progress freely until reaching the demo’s story cutoff point</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Solve knowledge-based puzzles using logic, observation, and deduction</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Track time-based events and uncover character schedules</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Follow guests as they move through the world and uncover their secrets through interrogation</p></li></ul>",
