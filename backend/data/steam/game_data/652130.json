At all times they are under scrutiny by an alien duo, one with likeness of a French Philosopher Voltaire and the other as Venetian Renaissance painter Tiziano, besides a common Raven, who appears to take great interest into the plight of the Hero and his friend.<br><br>        The game has a total of 21 levels, the first twenty being self sufficient dungeons of various lengths.<br>        The final level takes place in a village possessed by the 'evil shaggy one', where the whole story comes to a final wrap.<br><br>The story, characters and places are heavily influenced with everything from images of 'Lost in Space', 'Black Adder' or 'Monty Python' to words from the likes of 'Gargantua &amp; Pentagruel' &amp; 'Decameron' and strokes from painters like Pieter Brueghel, Van Eyck coupled with medieval superstitions, scriptural references and bestiary catalogs.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><u>Featuring:</u></h2></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 21 levels with maps tailored to suit different puzzles and characters<br></li><li> Graphically crafted to pay homage to 'olde masters'<br></li><li> Non punishing approach to solve puzzles (not much of 'use everything on anything' until it works)<br></li><li> Array of weird, different places and characters to meet<br></li><li> Continuous story which envelops the puzzles for the final event<br></li><li> Ambient sound and music to add to that ghastly 'dark ages' feel :D<br></li><li> Additionally, 15 nifty renaissance achievements to peruse</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/652130/extras/08b223a382c8d271683ec29d8b00f390.avif?t=1754415318\" width=310 height=338 /></span>",
