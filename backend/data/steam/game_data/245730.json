    "description": "<strong>20 years after the original game’s launch</strong>, Conrad is enlisted back to active service for the triumphant return of one of the most acclaimed franchises in gaming history.<br><br><strong>It’s not a reboot. It’s Flashback re-imagined.</strong> The original Core-Team revamped their own creation, leveraging the best of today’s technology while remaining true to the classic side-scroller that set the standards of the genre in the 90’s.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Key Features</h2><br><br><strong>One of the best adventure-action games ever created re-imagined by its creators.</strong> It’s the same team. It’s the same passion. Only this time, they have had much more firepower at their disposal to recreate the legendary classic!<br><br><strong>Gorgeous graphics, amazing animations.</strong> It’s the Flashback you’ve always dreamed of. True to the original spirit but made a million times better by using modern engines such as Unreal and Havok. The makeover is completely stunning.<br><br><strong>It’s all about Gameplay.</strong> The team modernized gameplay mechanics, making the game more reactive, offering new features, like gadgets and an experience progression system. But the developers kept the original formula in mind: a fine balance between rolling and shooting, exploring remote space stations and obliterating hostile alien planets.<br><br><strong>Bringing back new memories.</strong> The story was revamped to speak to 21st century gamers. Most of the cast of the original game is still here – Conrad, the Morphs – but you can expect new characters and a few twists you’re definitely not going to forget… this time.<br><br>Please note that as of November 2017, the online features for this game are no longer supported. The Multiplayer mode / Co-op mode will no longer be accessible.",
