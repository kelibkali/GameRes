You are one of the chosen few who know of the four Ancient Gods – infinite beings forgotten by history. Each god’s Sphere of Influence still permeates this world -- all living things are subconsciously bound to one of them. Tapping into the Spheres of Influence, you summon and command the might of enormous monsters, epic heroes and arcane dragons to defeat your enemies!<br><br>Each duel brings new challenges, with the huge amount of cards available, you’ll always be up against strategies that push the limits of Alteil’s various gameplay mechanics – such as the day/night cycle and its effects on undead and lycanthropes, the Soul Card system that lets each player fine tune their Life Point total to better compliment rush or combo play styles, and the Revival system that turns extra copies of a unit in the deck into ‘extra lives’ for that unit on the field. Every match also yields exciting treasure drops, to help you build a vast card collection or just fine-tune and perfect your favorite decks!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/379870/extras/fe50c1c43b88b1c8fa8508c92a15ffdf.webp?t=1482262032\" width=329 height=50 /></span><br>In addition to completing a successful Kickstarter and presenting at the <strong>Indie Megabooth</strong> at PAX East 2014, we’ve been lucky enough to get some great press for Alteil: Horizons.
