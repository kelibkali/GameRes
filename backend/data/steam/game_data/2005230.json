The island is located in the middle of the pristine freshwater of Lake Huron. It was founded and built by French settlers in the year 1666 after a military conflict.  It was a military outpost that later converted into a successful trading outpost. The indigenous population and French had trading relations that were very historic and highly regarded! Speaking of history, historians claim the island is named after the arc angel Bootelbub. However, some speculate it was named after the trading post's popular bever pelt boots!<br><br>Legend has it that there's a deeply hidden secret about the island's past. Some say they feel like they're being pulled...or...drawn to the island. City marketers jumped on this conspiracy theory and made the Boots Bay city motto &quot;The island that you won't want to leave!&quot;<br><br>The city is widely known for its European look and it's one of the city's main tourist attractions! You can visit some of the local attractions, such as, but not limited to...<br><br><strong>Boots Bay City streets</strong><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2005230/extras/540d45e140aa50eb336d70b51d0b848d.poster.avif?t=1765637963\" width=700 height=438 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2005230/extras/540d45e140aa50eb336d70b51d0b848d.webm?t=1765637963\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2005230/extras/540d45e140aa50eb336d70b51d0b848d.mp4?t=1765637963\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Navigate through Boots Bay city on foot through Eurocentric architecture!<br></li><li>Enjoy the sights &amp; sounds of the Canadian island atmosphere<br></li><li>Find your way to a few points of interest places like the famous supermarket, burger joint and bank!</li></ul><br><strong>Visit the historic Mansion / Nun-house</strong><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2005230/extras/69377452384adc1fcc564343e8188e09.poster.avif?t=1765637963\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2005230/extras/69377452384adc1fcc564343e8188e09.webm?t=1765637963\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2005230/extras/69377452384adc1fcc564343e8188e09.mp4?t=1765637963\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Explore the city's first mansion, built right beside the world-famous church!<br></li><li>Known for its humble beginnings as the first home of Lord Goldberg, the infamous knight who settled on the island in 1777 <br></li><li>Some historians believe the mansion was built on top of the, then village's old French prison.
