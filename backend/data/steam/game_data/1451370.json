In it, a key, and a small note that read:<br><br><i>&quot;We look forward to your visit.&quot;</i><br><br>Two years prior, a co-worker of hers had received the same parcel and invitation. Only he never came back. Desperate to establish her reputation at the bureau, Lauren resolved to finding out the truth behind the origin of the parcel, as well as the fate of her friend.

In classic survival horror fashion, explore through cinematic, fixed-camera perspective, utilizing tank controls and managing inventory --- all the nostalgic utilities you'd come to expect. As a one-man band, there were limitations in what I could implement, but paying homage to the old style of horror was something I had to give considerable attention to; details could not be compromised as I pursued a genuine return to form that I'd felt was missing in the more action-oriented turn that survival horror has taken.<br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1451370/extras/b5af0f7e06d57a8d9d221a304d97e6b6.avif?t=1673916917\" width=551 height=133 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1451370/extras/4caf3451b6124a08f5cc00c8d346e415.poster.avif?t=1673916917\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1451370/extras/4caf3451b6124a08f5cc00c8d346e415.webm?t=1673916917\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1451370/extras/4caf3451b6124a08f5cc00c8d346e415.mp4?t=1673916917\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><strong>Q</strong>uestion the evasive folks at the Motel who seemed to know more than they let on; get the truth, dig deep for the information that someone --- or something --- desperately wants to keep hidden.

There's a haunting dynamic found in playing someone vulnerable and frail, which adds to the anxiety of gameplay. I spent almost a year creating a video game that pays homage to that old school PS2 style survival horror. I wanted to return that feeling of dread, vulnerability, and mystery that has been lost for some time.",
