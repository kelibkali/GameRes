The puzzle was created from the original illustration in UHD. All the details are exactly as the artist envisioned and created them. This is a puzzle of a hard challenge even for experienced builders. Both the sky and the ground are going to prove difficult to assemble. The details in the scene that can be used to build a frame are few and difficult in their own right. We are curious to see if you're up to the challenge with this beautiful puzzle box.<br><br>Also, make sure to check the other 2 puzzle boxes in the series: <strong>Haunted Mill</strong> and <strong>Witched Night</strong>.",
