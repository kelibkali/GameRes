The player controls a character inside a warehouse, viewed from above, and must push boxes onto designated storage locations. Boxes can only be pushed, never pulled, and only one box can be moved at a time. This simple rule creates deep, often fiendishly clever puzzles where planning is essential, and a single wrong move can make a level unsolvable. The game’s minimalistic mechanics have made it one of the most influential puzzle formats in video game history, spawning thousands of clones and variants.</p>",
