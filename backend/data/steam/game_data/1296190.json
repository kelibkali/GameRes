    "description": "*Note, &quot;What a Cluster Fight&quot; is a party game that is meant to be played with two people and at least one game pad.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a party game about fighting your friends with unique characters in a fast paced action platforming setting across beautiful environments. This game has full controller support. It's a party game, so play with your friends! This is perfect for a quick match with a couple of people. Play as more than 6 unique characters with special abilities. Drop into an arena, and try to murder your friends while guns fall from the sky to aid those fast(or lucky) enough to pick them up. Fight in a rapid race through over 50 levels to take the win from your friends. Throughout these levels, you will find pitfalls, explosive barrels, spikes, moving platforms, and more. The controls are very simple, making this game super easy to pick up for even inexperienced gamers. 5 minutes of playing will put everyone in the competition. The soundtrack is pretty boppin' as well. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI made this game as a solo indie game developer, and it would mean a lot if you picked up this game. I hope you enjoy it, and get killin'.",
