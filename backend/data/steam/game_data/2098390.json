That is OK, the planet surfer program probably should not have entrusted the fate of the universe to gamers.. But, they did.<br><br>*Warning: Planet Surfer contains fast moving imagery and various effects such as white flashes that may potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy.",
