We are working on a fix for a future update.</strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>STORY</strong></h2>In a distant future, ruled by international Corporations, there is always a struggle for power. Most power can be bought with money, everything else can be stolen. This is where the “Guild”  comes into place. An international secret organization of master thieves, working for the highest bidder. Only the best are recruited into the Guild and may become a Panther agent. <br><br><br>Once inside the Guild, you must give up your civilian life, and will be assigned to a crew. <br>Take on contracts provided by the Guild, and steal top-secret prototypes or ancient artifacts from highly secured locations.
