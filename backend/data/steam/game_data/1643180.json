Hundreds of cards represent the psyche of your artist's mind, and life in Oportunia, the city known as the world capital of contemporary art.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1643180/extras/bfa5b9f338acf4f66c53c4f4dac8154e.poster.avif?t=1759999064\" width=596 height=212 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1643180/extras/bfa5b9f338acf4f66c53c4f4dac8154e.webm?t=1759999064\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1643180/extras/bfa5b9f338acf4f66c53c4f4dac8154e.mp4?t=1759999064\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A rich variety of interaction mechanics</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >All these artistic, amusing, horrible or lustful details of life are presented as hundreds of lovingly painted cards that can be combined, collected, talked or thought about, visited, read or interacted and so on, resulting in a vast diversity of results, creating new cards and new opportunities of interaction.

Poverty, physical ailments, sanity loss and other challenges regularly result in permadeath (a variety of permadeaths, beginning with dying to disease and ending with drinking oneself to death), followed by a tactful overview of your life (often miserable, addiction-fuelled, yet passionate) and legacy. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >During your life, unpleasant feelings will evolve from bad to worse if not dealt with. You will have to battle conditions like frustration, anxiety, anger, guilt, sadness, suicidal thoughts, and multitudes of other issues, including habits, addictions and temptations of various kind.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Painting, and other pleasures</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >As an artist, you can paint your sufferings into spectacular masterpieces, or counter them with pleasant feelings such as love, pure delight or peace. If all else fails, you can always seek solace in the Bar Avenue establishments, hoping to drown the bleak thoughts in drink or more exotic soothments. Roguelite fans may enjoy the iron person mode. <br> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1643180/extras/9d2d33938159145230345d7aa8a119c3.poster.avif?t=1759999064\" width=596 height=212 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1643180/extras/9d2d33938159145230345d7aa8a119c3.webm?t=1759999064\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1643180/extras/9d2d33938159145230345d7aa8a119c3.mp4?t=1759999064\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>18 different endings</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You may win numerous minor victories and a selection of grand victories.

Practical “ai visuals” didn’t exist yet because they were too primitive to be considered problematic by anyone - but they did work as messy impressionist oil painting illustrations (while still needing months of manual work to become usable).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >We hope  - even if there’s a justified rage burning in your heart against ongoing misuse of AI- you  differentiate our old indie passion project from products that (unlike ours) use AI unethically, irresponsibly or predatorily.</p>",
