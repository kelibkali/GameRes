There are no predefined list of buildings that you must choose from, you can freely design your own. Use the Schematic Editor to design a structure, and your villagers can build it wherever you want afterwards. Multitasking is key in this game, as each villager can work independently, so you might have one villager collecting wood, while another digs for stone. In the first 3 days, you should focus on getting your villagers settled, and have some defenses built, as on the third night, skeletons will attack.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/878970/extras/4c6b2b96e121461d6051e815b08fa935.avif?t=1555613964\" width=512 height=134 /></span><br>The world is randomly generated, with 3 different climate zones alternating through north and south.
