    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Story</h2>A malfunction with your experimental R-COIL engine has torn a hole in reality and you have fallen through it. You find yourself under attack by a horde of unfamiliar and hostile creatures. Your main thruster and weapons systems have been fused and your stabilizer is offline; you cannot fire your weapons without moving. Will you find your way home, or will you die trying?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Game</h2>R-COIL is an old-fashioned multi-directional shooter with a unique single button control scheme. Use the stick to aim and a single button to fire and thrust. Tap to fire. Hold to thrust. Each time you fire your bullet will push you back a little. You’ll have to balance shooting and thrusting to maintain control. Once you master it you’ll be cruising through the cosmos like a space boss in no time. Just try not to get yourself killed.<br><br><strong><i>Easy right?</i> Wrong!</strong> This is not the friendly part of space and whatever you run into isn’t going to be happy to see you. There are shielded sharpshooting saucers, bullet spewing spinners, laser towers, and kamikaze buzz-saws to name a few. In fact, if it’s not a rock, you’re probably going to have to try to kill it before it kills you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Single Player, Local Co-op, &amp; Local Duel Modes.<br></li><li>Stress Free Mode - Relax and shoot. No lives. No pressure.<br></li><li>Countless Enemies and even more Power-ups.<br></li><li>Music and sound by the utterly unfamous Rainbow Kitten.</li></ul>",
