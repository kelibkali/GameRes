Harvest resources, find treasure, and forge the weapons that will help you on your journey.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/511540/extras/c4c46aaa0417b2d43640d2d4271614b0.avif?t=1768021334\" width=620 height=223 /></span><br><br>Every game in MoonQuest features a unique, procedurally-generated world to explore. Each world contains a variety of regions, each with their own resources, wildlife, enemies, merchants, weather, and moon. Delve into the caves below the forest to find rare metal ores, adventure into ancient ruins to discover powerful items, and find the lost cathedral to discover its secrets. The world in MoonQuest is fully destructible, so you'll be chopping through thick vines to gain entrance to lairs and demolishing walls to infiltrate castles and ruins. <br><br>Some examples of regions you may encounter are:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A forest buried in snow, with frozen ponds and wandering bandits;<br></li><li>A grand castle atop a mountain, guarded by a silver legion;<br></li><li>A labyrinthine ruin preceding a desolate tomb;<br></li><li>A rope bridge leading to a deserted beach;<br></li><li>A sewer system hiding an ancient rusted machine;<br></li><li>A winding system of sugar caves, populated by bats;<br></li><li>A cathedral plagued by demons, hidden below an altar; and,<br></li><li>A bustling village of craftspeople.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/511540/extras/dc499f1e0074b09aed4c84d876a6ea41.avif?t=1768021334\" width=620 height=223 /></span><br><br>There are many playable characters in MoonQuest, many with unique abilities or items.
