    "description": "This is the third puzzle box in the puzzle collection based on the classical painter <strong>Frederic Edwin Church</strong>*. <strong>Cotopaxi</strong> is an 1862 oil painting that was commissioned by well-known philanthropist James Lenox. The painting was met with great acclaim, and seen as a parable of the Civil War, then raging in the South, with its casting of light against darkness. The painting depicts Cotopaxi, a volcano that is also the second-highest peak in modern-day Ecuador, spewing smoke and ash across a sunrise. Church also painted another landscape by the same name that also features the volcano in the distance.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Content Details</h2>Contains <i>one</i> new puzzle box for Masters of Puzzle. The UHD image captures the original painting in great detail which in turn allows for very detailed and diverse puzzle tiles. There is a large variety of detailed sections in this painting which will allow for a structured approach when assembling the puzzle. The most difficult part seems to be the cloud of ashes as it will almost certainly result in very similar looking tiles. This puzzle box will represent a medium challenge for most puzzle builders.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1230730/extras/6de88d7055a24b8806cab6ef2eb5c88e.webp?t=1582928392\" width=32 height=32 /></span> * <i>Note: The painting used in this DLC is in the public domain in its country of origin and other countries and areas where the copyright term is the author's life plus 100 years or less.</i>",
