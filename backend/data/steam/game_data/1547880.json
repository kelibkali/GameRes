I told myself one day I'll make my own game and that's exactly what I'm doing here with Aurascope! <br><br>Aurascope's intention as a game is to make the player feel a sense of wonder and enjoyment! Taking the best of what platformers do while at the same time adding more oomph to it. Plenty of content, care, polish, and more to make sure this game is something memorable, replayable, and most importantly fun! Accessibility is key, because at the end of the day we all want to have a good time and enjoy ourselves. Whether you like to take your time and play games casually or if you're a dedicated speedrunner who likes to blast their way through levels, Aurascope aims to provide an unforgettable experience to everyone!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1547880/extras/e0ce61f6f535fd28e956e86a9d235463.poster.avif?t=1742681171\" width=600 height=322 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1547880/extras/e0ce61f6f535fd28e956e86a9d235463.webm?t=1742681171\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1547880/extras/e0ce61f6f535fd28e956e86a9d235463.mp4?t=1742681171\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1547880/extras/b77301f598830c5621b0b482bf879e5d.avif?t=1742681171\" width=624 height=143 /></span>",
