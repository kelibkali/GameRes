    "description": "An astronaut flies through outer space inside a tiny space capsule. Alas, then little problems inside the vehicle start to snowball, ending in a dramatic crash. The astronaut wants to spread his wings and fly once more – and return to his childhood dream. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis breathtaking story is an amazing opportunity to experience true weightlessness and float in space. In VR animation you can look beyond the flat image and see things that are normally hidden from our eyes. It allows you to immerse yourself in the exciting atmosphere and feel part of the story. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe word &quot;Aripi&quot; is translated from Romanian as &quot;Wings&quot;. Here wings symbolize freedom and the leap of our imagination.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is a strong personal message behind the story as the film is dedicated to our close friend, the pilot Yuri Boroday, who disappeared during his last flight.",
