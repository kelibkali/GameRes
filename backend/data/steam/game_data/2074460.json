    "description": "One Night at Barneys 3 is a continuation as well as a reimagining of the series started on Scratch four years ago. Based off of the wildly popular horror game, Five Nights at Freddy's, you will spend one night trapped in a prison, forced to defend yourself against Barney and many of his colleagues. Spend your night checking the hallways, vents, and cameras, collecting materials to craft and upgrade the tools at your disposal, and discovering secrets to alter the endgame. However there are no doors. Instead you are equipped with a EERG-15 Shotgun. Works like a charm...until you run out of bullets.",
