We use a combination of stunning pixel art, music, and unique narrative techniques to paint a charming postmodern story that will keep players intrigued and entertained until the end.<br><br><strong>100+ HANDCRAFTED CHALLENGES​</strong><br>This game features a distinct gameplay mechanic: our hero cannot move on his own, so you’ll have to rotate platforms and manipulate environments to launch him around a beautiful 16-bit world. You'll need logic, brainpower, quick reflexes, and unconditional trust in A.I.D.E. to pass more than a hundred highly polished levels. You’ll be surprised that it doesn’t get old.<br><br><strong>INTENTIONAL AND UNINTENTIONAL COMEDY​</strong><br>Our testers have been enjoying some of the game’s philosophical jokes, and moments that weren’t meant to be jokes.<br><br><strong>POSSIBLY SPOOKY​</strong><br>This game may contain horror elements and digital beings that could scare you.
