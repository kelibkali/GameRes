Even this is not the entirety of the danger, however, for as the heroes soon learn, there are other forces searching for the final shards as well--some hailing from the Darklands below, and some from beyond reality in the nightmare realm of Leng!<br><i>   This volume of Pathfinder Adventure Path continues the Shattered Star Adventure Path and includes:</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>&quot;Into the Nightmare Rift,&quot; a Pathfinder RPG adventure for 13th-level characters, by Richard Pett.<br></li><li>Previously unknown secrets about H.
