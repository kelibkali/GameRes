Now is the time for rage!</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1015930/extras/a0b7eb8592728150a038e0657cd12df2.avif?t=1760950360\" width=616 height=127 /></span><br><br>Created by acclaimed designer Eric Lang (Rising Sun, Arcadia Quest, Chaos in the Old World), Blood Rage lets you <strong>lead one of the seven ancient Viking clans</strong>: The Wolf, Bear, Serpent, Raven, Ram, Wild Boar and Stag clan. <strong>Each with their own unique miniatures</strong> of warriors and leaders. <br>In Blood Rage, your <strong>goal is to achieve the greatest amount of glory</strong> before the end of the third and final age—and the arrival of Ragnarök. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1015930/extras/88ab754699c84abc460b3406373a9dd4.avif?t=1760950360\" width=616 height=586 /></span><br><br>Each god is generous in their own way: Frigga provides resources and support, Tyr strengthens your clan in battle while Loki rewards losing battles or punishes the opposing winner. <br><br><strong>Drafting gifts</strong> from a god will determine the strategy you want to implement. Choose your cards wisely or deprive your opponents of precious gifts. <br><br>For your clan, there are <strong>many paths to Glory</strong>: <br>•\t<strong>Invade </strong>the mythical land of Midgard and its nine provinces, pillaging their villages and the province of Yggdrasil. <br>•\t<strong>Crush </strong>other clans in ferocious battles and encounter legendary creatures from Norse mythology. <br>•\t<strong>Fulfill </strong>quests in honor of the mighty gods. <br>•\t<strong>Die </strong>gloriously in battle or from Ragnarök as any Viking was born to do. <br>•\tThe <strong>only losing strategy</strong> in Blood Rage is to <strong>cower from combat</strong>.  <br><br>Earning your place to Valhalla in single-player mode is glorious. Eternal triumph, however, can only be achieved by reaching the top of the leaderboard in <strong>ranked online multiplayer</strong>. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1015930/extras/bf93d36991d5d3c55c195f7ebaefb70b.poster.avif?t=1760950360\" width=616 height=346 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1015930/extras/bf93d36991d5d3c55c195f7ebaefb70b.webm?t=1760950360\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1015930/extras/bf93d36991d5d3c55c195f7ebaefb70b.mp4?t=1760950360\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1015930/extras/ffcd1d03a04315fb96b0595476829a03.avif?t=1760950360\" width=615 height=138 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Fight to gain entry to Valhalla</strong>: Pillage, fight, sacrifice… Experience a new type of strategy game where victory can only be achieved by commanding your warriors in the field of battle in the face of final doom. <br></li><li><strong>Welcome to Midgard</strong>: Dozens of 3d scanned miniatures and a dynamic board faithful to the original boardgame. <br></li><li><strong>Multi-layered strategy game</strong>: Blood Rage mixes draft, hidden cards, resource management and its sheer load of trickery.
