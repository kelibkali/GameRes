    "description": "<i><strong>SAMPHI IS CURRENTLY ON INDEFINITE HIATUS FROM DEVELOPMENT. THANK YOU TO ALL THE PLAYERS WHO SUPPORTED THE GAME OVER LAST FEW YEARS. SEE MY LAST UPDATE FOR AN EXPLANATION</strong></i><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/341270/extras/e00a568323bd0902370645f61cc153a8.webp?t=1500193517\" width=600 height=55 /></span><br><br>Samphi is a fresh randomly-generated survival-RPG, with a shifted focus to skills, world management, and a story mode*. Travel through broken memories of a failing relationship to try and salvage what’s left. How you play is up to you. The world is yours. Your story is waiting.<br><br>DISCLAIMER: SAMPHI IS IN EARLY ACCESS. BY PURCHASING NOW YOU ARE NOT PURCHASING A COMPLETE TITLE BUT ARE ACTIVELY SUPPORTING THE PROJECT BY PURCHASING THE PROMISE OF ONE. IN THE MEAN-TIME, THERE MAY BE BUGS AND OTHER ISSUES. YOU KNOW THE DRILL. :)<br><br>*The story mode of Samphi will be included in the full release. While in Early Access the game is limited to local and online freeplay.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/341270/extras/661399adae5f9d28acb0741363fa54d9.webp?t=1500193517\" width=600 height=55 /></span><br><br><br>The story of Samphi is about re-living memories of a failing relationship in a last-ditch attempt to understand and save it. All memories will take place in randomly generated sandbox areas, giving you freedom over how they play. Instead of just carting the player from A to B with fixed dialog, I want you to be able to create your own worlds, play how you want, and ultimately have your own experience. Also, with the addition of RPG features such as character progression, skills, and pets, I hope to really immerse the player into the world they create.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/341270/extras/0b637bc8c7dadfd6bd6ff1b407b461fe.avif?t=1500193517\" width=636 height=218 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><strong>• Play as either 'Boy' or 'Girl'.</strong></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><strong>• Each memory will take place in a randomly generated area.</strong></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><strong>• Complete all memories in the timeline, and their associated tasks, to learn the story behind 'boy' &amp; 'girl'.</strong></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><strong>• Samphi's story is me sharing my own experience. The loose telling of the story will allow you to add your own significance to the experience.</strong></ul><br><br>If that's not your bag there's always freeplay mode!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/341270/extras/cba2d6d6c5e19097095c33f56fe8b22c.webp?t=1500193517\" width=600 height=55 /></span><br><br>Since I’m telling my story in a sandbox universe, it only makes sense to open it up and provide a freeplay mode! No goals, no story, just sandbox goodness. Create your own world, live your own story, use your skills to survive, and hone them to master the world around you. The goal isn’t the usual exploration and/or fighting, sure that’s there, but the goal is to establish yourself and build the best world around you.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/341270/extras/c5434afae66646cee51daeaf4c19a0c6.webp?t=1500193517\" width=600 height=55 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">Each world is made up of randomly-generated areas. What you do in this world is up to you!Dig, build, gather and create your own world. Don't take too long; things go bump in the night.You have plenty of materials at your disposal so let's see what you can create with them.</ul><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/341270/extras/5f1843fc2394c4f72776356f95e5a5ef.webp?t=1500193517\" width=600 height=55 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">Once you have gathered your materials you are ready to craft.Use what you have gathered to forge new items and equipment to help you build your world.To craft better items and building materials build yourself a crafting bench.</ul><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/341270/extras/cce11f8cf6468dc343d9264f52c72191.webp?t=1500193517\" width=600 height=55 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">Now you have your items and a shelter its time for the final step.

I’ve always loved the genre, and play many of the entries in it, but I’ve always wanted a smaller, more intimate experience with more meaning. That’s my goal, and I hope you enjoy Samphi!",
