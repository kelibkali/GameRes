Forced to run right, you'll encounter any number of monsters, allies, thieves and shops on your desperate journey to stop the end of everything.<br><br>The good news is that you don't just have access to one world. You have access to all of them. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/266210/extras/8bd0b3c88502092d1afc0a94e8841582.avif?t=1728470787\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A nearly infinite number of worlds to save and explore!<br></li><li>Multiple classes to unlock, each with different skills and advantages.<br></li><li>Dimensional Vault: Don't waste extra valuables!

Simply input the name at the Dimensional selection screen before you begin your journey. Want to try your luck with a random reality? Type any word that pops into your head, and watch as One Way Heroics builds you a world based on the name you chose.<br><br>Infinite permutations. Infinite worlds.
