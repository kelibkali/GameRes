    "description": "Prana is a playful meditation experience that the user engages with their breath; employing physical breath to heal various creatures in their environment, while<br />\r\nlearning to control their own breath and emotional state. Proprietary audio digital signal processing enables Prana to track breathing using the HMD’s built-in microphone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrana is intended for use as a calming non-competitive place for a few minutes of quiet wandering and healing each day. The experience is one of self-directed exploration and focus within a rich visual environment, as the player comes across ailing creatures and brings them back to health.",
