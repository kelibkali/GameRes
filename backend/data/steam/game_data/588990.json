    "description": "<strong>Intro</strong><br>The first outposts fell within minutes and before morning there was nothing but radio silence. <br><br>Did they come from a distant world or deep within the Earth’s crust? Perhaps they were formed by the very fibers of man’s worst intentions, a cosmic comeuppance for lives misspent. Whatever their origin, these are the facts: they don’t rest, they can’t be reasoned with, and their intent is singular; to extinguish mankind wherever they step foot. <br><br>Shore up your outpost, take up arms, and hope the night ends with this terrible enemy returning from whence they came.<br><br><strong>Gameplay</strong><br>The outposts have gone quiet and the sensor network is down, but things look clear at outpost 1. Have they withdrawn or do they lie quietly in wait? You must make your way to the outpost to find the answer.<br><br>Get the outposts back online, and with the help of your AI companion accessible over your handheld radio, take back and defend from an onslaught of monstrous invaders. Use whatever you can to keep them at bay. Board up the doors and build your defenses, secure the hatches, but even that won’t stop them for long... Load up, strap on your guns, and prepare to fight to reclaim what’s yours.<br><br>Play the first gamemode Reclamation, at outpost 1.
