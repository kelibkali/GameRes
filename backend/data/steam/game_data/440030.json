    "description": "Star Realms: Gambit incorporates both the Gambit set and the Year One organized play promo cards from the physical card game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe stakes have been raised.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGambits provide an exciting new way to play Star Realms. Each player is dealt two random Gambits to begin the game. When you need them, they help give you a big boost. Will you Rise to Power? Will you make a Smuggling Run? Or will you unleash a Surprise Assault? For most of the Gambits, you can use them once and then they are gone. Timing is everything!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore power, more tricks, more strategy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ships and bases that come with the digital Gambit Expansion are ships that were originally given away at tournaments and events as promotional cards. Highly sought after, these powerful cards add more variety to the trade deck, and can be used together with the Gambit cards, or separate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe expansion contains 18 cards: one base and one ship per faction, nine Gambits, and one unaligned ship. It also contains thirteen new missions spread across two new campaigns.",
