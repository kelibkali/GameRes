MFL 2 is a brutal, darkly comedic 8-on-8 arcade-style action-packed football game. Teams of Mutated Super-Humans, Monstrous Orcs, Skeletal Deadheads, and Armored BruiserBots are pit against each other in fantastical arenas packed with deadly traps and sinister hazards like buzzsaws and giant mutant worms. This “anti-Madden” blends the pick-up-and-play accessibility of arcade sports games with strategic depth and a buttload of monstrous mayhem. Referees don’t just blow calls — they get blown up. Players don’t just fumble — they explode into limbs and pink mist.<strong> </strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1657320/extras/bef7ed3c2e81bd3d23f026c1b6158871.poster.avif?t=1770302716\" width=480 height=270 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1657320/extras/bef7ed3c2e81bd3d23f026c1b6158871.webm?t=1770302716\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1657320/extras/bef7ed3c2e81bd3d23f026c1b6158871.mp4?t=1770302716\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Create.
