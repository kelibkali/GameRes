But as you move, you capture the squares around you, growing at an exponential rate!  <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1030960/extras/c5c2612995d245466586909eec358dbc.poster.avif?t=1662756987\" width=200 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1030960/extras/c5c2612995d245466586909eec358dbc.webm?t=1662756987\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1030960/extras/c5c2612995d245466586909eec358dbc.mp4?t=1662756987\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Watch out as you encounter your friend's square armies - only the clever players will survive.

Includes support for any controller you might plug in.  xInput and all other APIs supported.<br></li><li> 2 players can play on a keyboard with WASD and the arrow keys in case you don't have enough controllers lying around!<br></li><li> 2 difficulties of Bots to play against!</li></ul>This game is a brand new concept and comes from sheer love of local multiplayer and disappointment that so few video games can be played with more than 4 players on the same screen.  I'm looking to get feedback here on Steam before a console release, so please send any issues and gameplay suggestions to the game’s contact email, community hub, steam message or &quot;hockenmaier&quot; on Twitter.  Thanks for playing!",
