Additionally, there are riddles and puzzles you can't solve by platforming only: you'll need to collect lore and figure out the secrets. Fencing is also very important to overcome your foes, and you must learn how to do it properly. You'll be also able to handle a lot of situations by avoiding combat or defeating your enemies via the environment if you're cunning enough.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >How in-depth the Tower Builder is?</h2>The Tower Builder (a.k.a. level editor) you get is identical to the one we used to create the majority of the content. You can create any kind of tower with dialogues, scripted puzzles, traps, events, and share it with other people! Basic editing is quite intuitive, but a full documentation/manual is also available.",
