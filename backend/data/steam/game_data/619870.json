Exploration is encouraged, and the levels are full of secrets. There is no timer forcing you to move quickly, and you don't always have to move forward.<br><br>You explore the world using the map, so you can play the levels in a large variety of orders. Not all levels have to be played, but all of them contain stuff to find. There are also safe areas like the village of Happy Hill Homes, the Caravanserai in the desert, and the crazy hermit's shopping mall in Hermit Hollow. There you can talk to the locals and purchase upgrades like Extra Hearts or Double Jump Boots.",
