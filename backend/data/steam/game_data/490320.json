Steam Powered Giraffe did music for SteamWorld Heist and Rabbit, The Spine, and Hatchworth make an appearance in the game, as themselves, entertaining their fellow robots in-game with their catchy tunes! <br><br>This album includes the SteamWorld Heist theme song created by the band, as well as 12 tracks, featuring 6 completely original songs written for the game, and 6 classic Steam Powered Giraffe songs, re-recorded to fit into the SteamWorld Heist game universe. Ever wanted to hear what an acoustic version of Automatonic Electronic Harmonics would sound like? Well the game and this album have one! We even have a version of Brass Goggles, with backing vocals sung by the entire game development team at Image &amp; Form Games!<br><br>How to access the audio files:<br><br>The files can be found in your Steam directory: [...]\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\SteamWorld Heist\\SteamWorld Heist Soundtrack by Steam Powered Giraffe. <br><br>You can right-click SteamWorld Heist in your Steam games list, select &quot;Properties&quot;, select the tab &quot;Local Files&quot;, and press the button &quot;Browse Local Files&quot;.
