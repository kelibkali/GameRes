    "description": "Leadville Sub Division 2.0 available!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLeadville Sub is a connection line between the BNSF Railway and the UP Railroad. While the sub is owned by BNSF, UP trains have trackage rights to the yard located in Leadville. BNSF also has trackage rights for Port Eagle to pickup and drop off intermodal trains at the yard. Beyond the yard at Port Eagle is serviced by UP.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBetween Leadville and Dayton, a second track has been laid down to handle the increase traffic going to and from Orient. Plans to double track the remaining line hasn’t been planned out but if traffic demands picks up the idea might be brought back up. Only time will tell.",
