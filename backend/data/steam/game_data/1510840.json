The swingmeter let's you use your timing and skill to determine the result of your attacks instead! Don't worry if your reflexes sucks though. The Guardians of Gridvale never &quot;miss&quot;. Even botched attacks do some amount of damage. You can turn this off if you prefer a more traditional, random damage system. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1510840/extras/3a6bc7026bb6bd805820cbe730911e5e.poster.avif?t=1718779178\" width=600 height=336 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1510840/extras/3a6bc7026bb6bd805820cbe730911e5e.webm?t=1718779178\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1510840/extras/3a6bc7026bb6bd805820cbe730911e5e.mp4?t=1718779178\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Unique skill trees</h2>Each hero has their own unique skill tree that you can tweak to suit your play style. Don't like to play defense? Then turn your pacifist cleric into a bloodthirsty mass-murderer that leaves piles of corpses in his wake... Well, maybe not exactly like that since there's no cleric in the game (or is there?) but you get the point!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Go camping</h2>All heroes need to relax and clear their heads a little between sessions of stomping baddies and what better way of doing that than going camping? Rest and tend to your wounds, hang out with friends or sharpen your weapons to make stabbing poor goblins an even more satisfying experience! It's your camp and your heroes, so you decide how they should waste their time.  <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1510840/extras/3292e0f774faf7bd1aaa7efe806fdd0b.poster.avif?t=1718779178\" width=600 height=336 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1510840/extras/3292e0f774faf7bd1aaa7efe806fdd0b.webm?t=1718779178\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1510840/extras/3292e0f774faf7bd1aaa7efe806fdd0b.mp4?t=1718779178\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Other features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Fast paced turn based combat. </strong>No need to go and make coffee while waiting for excruciatingly slow animations to complete. <br></li><li><strong>Customizable difficulty. </strong> Make the enemies frail like soft tissue paper or reduce their damage. If your reflexes are a thing of the past you can always make the timing mini-game go slower or turn it off completely and rely on random damage. I won't stop you if you want to make the game harder either. <br></li><li><strong>Classic 2D perspective and old school pixel art. </strong>Grandparents generally can’t handle rotating cameras nor fancy “3D” graphics so I made a game that works for them too!<br></li><li><strong>A game full of idiots and stupid jokes.</strong> Who said that saving the world needs to be boring, dark and dull?</li></ul>",
