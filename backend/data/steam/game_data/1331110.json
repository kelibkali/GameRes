    "description": "“Animations Select” is a series of premium animation asset packs designed to provide game designers with flexible and affordable options to upgrade specific areas of their projects. Unlike &quot;Animations Collection&quot;, the focus of each &quot;Animations Select&quot; is much narrower; the former provides breadth, the latter provides depth, and in this case... FIRE! Lots of explosive, bright, blasting fire animations to bring some combustible activity to your games!<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* 2 casting animations.<br />\r\n* 6 skill animations.<br />\r\n* 2 full-screen skill animations. <br />\r\n* 60 FPS and 30 FPS versions of each animation, for a total of 20 animation sheets.<br />\r\n* For use with RPG Maker VX Ace or the engine of your choice!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Please Note: included Demo Project is for RPG Maker MV only",
