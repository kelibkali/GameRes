Turns out that having a cat puke into your ZFS fileserver while it was updating your remote backups can totally brick your setup. While I had builds on multiple cloud services and physical devices, the data rot of those files after my frequent updating made them unusable. I'm no longer able to continue developing the project despite my desire to as my gear is all broken/obsolete at this point. The existing game code is now free, but I'm unable to maintain or patch the project. I hope you enjoy my stillborn dream. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Another bad day in the future is an open world VR espionage game.
