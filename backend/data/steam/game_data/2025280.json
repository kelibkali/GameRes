    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >3D Joys is more of a utility and is short for 3D Joysticks. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >It's called that because it's based on Joysticks used in  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >arcades. 3D Joys allow the player to go 6 different directions  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >instead of 4 directions like from a regular Joystick with the help </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >of VR controllers. The player can summon their 3d Joystick at the  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >position of their hand by using the grip button and choosing from  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >up, down, right, left, forward or backwards motion done with a VR controller.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Testing their hand eye coordination in the process. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >VR Memory Cube is the first addition to 3D Joys. Test your memory </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >and maybe possibly improve it with a color remembering game like </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >the classic Simon game. Basically, the game is to remember a sequence </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >of colors on a cube while each side of the cube will light up different  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >colors that will resemble your cube which is the 3D Joystick around your hand when you summon it.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Online Leaderboard has been implemented for the people that want to show off. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Offline Leaderboard is also an option. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Oculus Rift is the only VR headset I tested this game on. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The future of 3D Joys will depend on its growth because there is</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >only one person working on this project which is myself and I am </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >a college dropout student with a Digital Arts Media Certificate. I started </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >working on this project when I had my first Computer Programing class, </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >where I learned Python and which made me pursue other programming </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >languages like C#. Unity is the engine that I am using to make this game. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >I am not a professional. I try as hard as I can to bring my vision for </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >this game into fruition and it may take longer than someone that knows </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >what they're doing but I hope you see the potential and come along the ride </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >that is 3D Joys. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >@WhoDisz</p>",
