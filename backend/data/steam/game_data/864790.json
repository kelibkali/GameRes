    "description": "FragmentVR is a VR application for HTC Vive owners that makes use of the front camera to create windows onto your surroundings from within virtual reality. <br>FragmentVR puts each view into a SteamVR Overlay so that you can create and use them while inside any other VR game or app. <br><strong>HTC Vive Pro is currently not supported</strong><br><br>Usage is simple: Place corners using the controller. Once 4 corners have been placed the view is created and remains fixed in 3D space.<br><br><strong>Upcoming Features &amp; improvements: </strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>HTC Vive Pro support<br></li><li>other HMDs + external camera support</li></ul><br><br> Check out our  to complain about bugs and request features!<br><br><br><strong>FragmentVR is only compatible with the standard HTC Vive for now</strong> since it is the only HMD with an accessible camera (HTC Vive Pro support is high on the to-do list but not currently supported ).",
