    "description": "In Dingleberries, spirits take physical form and must fight to the death before the gods. Using only their fists, up to 4 players try to punch each other off the map in excitingly intense battles. But there’s a twist: the characters have no legs! Instead, players use their fists to walk, jump, wall-jump, and punch their way across the map. The result is a highly immersive locomotion system that requires agility, timing and cardio! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can download Dingleberries Demo and try our locomotion system right now. In this singleplayer demo, your goal is to reach the end of the map as fast a possible. This demo is an alpha build of the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe full game is planned to release in early 2021. It will include many maps, PVP multiplayer fighting brawl and cosmetic items such as masks and gloves.",
