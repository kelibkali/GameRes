Bluey is out to stop the Cure, a virus that was created by Sparkle Evil, a corrupted government agency set on ruling the world. He is also avenging his father, who was slaughtered by the mutant King Spider. While on the road to King Spider's castle, you encounter 9 legendary beasts and one optional boss who all have a reason to cut your life short. There are 5 unique worlds containing dangerous enemies that will keep you running, and some towns where you can stop by a shop. In these shops, you can purchase new upgrades or even a skin with soul tokens (the in-game currency), which you can get by killing foes. Even though Bluey may seem alone, he has his trusty pew pew gun and petrified shotgun to guide him through hordes of enemies. Also, his handy bombs to send foes flying, and a grappling hook to explore new areas and get across pits full of lava.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1072210/extras/b2f581dfe12cb888219523655bfa4463.avif?t=1735659266\" width=600 height=150 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>✦Key Game Features✦</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Original Soundtrack<br></li><li>Xbox Controller Support</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Original Art<br></li><li>Mostly Created By One Person<br></li><li>Customizable Player Skins<br></li><li>Unlock Upgrades<br></li><li>Play In Fullscreen Mode<br></li><li>Multiple Fully Designed Boss Fights<br></li><li>Multiple Swappable Guns<br></li><li>In-Game Dialogue System<br></li><li>Explore 5 Unique Levels From Hell, To The Inside Of The Game <br></li><li>Use Your Gun As A Jet Pack</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1072210/extras/53df887e3c1a622965997e580520be2b.avif?t=1735659266\" width=600 height=150 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>✦Game Development Progress✦</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Game  87% Done<br></li><li>Platform Ports  10% Done</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Controls  90% Done<br></li><li>Gameplay  85% Done<br></li><li>Bosses  90% Done<br></li><li>Skins  100% Done</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Downloadable Content  0% Done</li></ul>",
