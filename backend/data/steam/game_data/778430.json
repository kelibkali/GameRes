    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Create in VR</h2>OSCKit is a virtual reality environment for composition and performance. Using Open Sound Control (OSC), OSCKit integrates with production software like Ableton Live or Max/MSP for a customizable creative workflow, no programming experience required!<br><br>Inspired by apps like TouchOSC and Lemur, this software aims to bring that same functionality into the 3rd dimension.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >How It Works</h2>OSCKit does not generate audio by itself, but rather controls another production software of your choosing. This is done using OSC messages - small packets of information that, for instance, tell a program to press a note or turn a knob. Loads of software supports OSC including:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Ableton Live<br></li><li>Logic Pro X<br></li><li>Cubase<br></li><li>Max/MSP<br></li><li>Pure Data</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>8 expressive control types including sliders, knobs and pads.<br></li><li>Built-in integration with TouchOSC Bridge for MIDI I/O.<br></li><li>Simple UI for one-button arrangement and performance.<br></li><li>Saving/Reopening kits for later expansion and sharing.<br></li><li>Customizable OSC addressing system.</li></ul>",
