Blitz is fundamentally different from the way delay-based and rollback netcode deal with input-delay. The few predictions made within blitz networking are all predestined and function without the occurrence of network fossils. Unlike rollback, Blitz only uses prediction in a limited manner that helps with syncing split-second long-distance character movements. Blitz is currently one of the only fighting based net codes that operate with dedicated low latency servers to provide players with a <strong>faster</strong> and more <strong>stable </strong>multiplayer experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > Full Mod Support </h2><br>Our discord provides resources for modders to use. Template mods for characters, stages, audio, assists, and stories are all available to the community along with a detailed tutorial to guide new modders.
