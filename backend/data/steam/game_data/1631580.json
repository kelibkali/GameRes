Choose a commander. While 3 players pilot drones on the battlefield, the commander controls the situation from a strategic point of view and assists allies with airdrops and airstrikes. The commander, however, works in the dark and relies solely on ground reports from his teammates. Learn to communicate accurately, mark the enemy and make risky decisions under time pressure. Friendly fire is always on, so if you fail, your bomb will not kill the ghouls, but your friends!<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1631580/extras/028413b83cdcba292630121fef13ebba.poster.avif?t=1734163595\" width=616 height=290 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1631580/extras/028413b83cdcba292630121fef13ebba.webm?t=1734163595\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Thrilling 4 vs. 4 mode</h2>Join your friends to compete against 4 other players in Versus Mode.
