    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > Q1 Queen of the Demonweb Pits</h2><i> How different things seem now from when you undertook the crushing of a few rebellious hill giants! What seemed a simple adventure has turned into a major expedition. Much time has passed since you discovered the conspiracy that led you to the frost giants, fire giants, and eventually to the long-forgotten Drow. Through your encounter with the dark elves, you have found the true source of the evil -- the demon queen Lolth!</i><br>This module is the exciting conclusion of a series of seven AD&amp;D modules. It may be played on its own or as the climax of the &quot;Giant&quot; series (G1-G3) and the 'Drow' series (D1-D3). The first of a new series of other-planar adventures, this module includes several new monsters, maps of the Demonweb and lair of Lolth, and notes on eight alternate worlds, suitable for expansion and addition to existing AD&amp;D campaigns.<br>For characters level 10 to 14.<br><strong><br><i> We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today.
