    "description": "<strong>Here's the OST for the Wild West themed incremental/clicker game, Fastest Hands In The WASD.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >How was the music made?</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>All of the games' music was made with BoscaCeoil, and then some of the tracks were further edited in FL Studio 20 and Audacity.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >This song sounds familiar, is it from something?</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Some songs take inspiration/patterns/samples from NES/SNES era soundtracks - while other songs are completely original. When sampled music is used, usually every aspect of it is altered, like the tempo, instruments, patterns, and overall structure (as well as the fact that it's now in the 8-bit style). If you hear a song and make a connection, that's exactly what we wanted - that being songs that lend themselves to an established theme/style/mood without being an exact copy.</li></ul>",
