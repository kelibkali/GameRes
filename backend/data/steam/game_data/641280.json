    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>A17: Haunting at Rybalka Lodge (PFRPG)</strong></h2>A Pathfinder compatible adventure for four to six PCs of levels 7-9<br><i>With royalty coming to town, the reopening of the new Rybalka Lodge couldnt be timelier. Although the place is warm and inviting during the day, it becomes a different place at night. Locals refuse to approach Rybalka Lodge and the owner is fire-fighting rumors of it being haunted.</i><br><i>The original lodge burned down just one year ago, possibly by Vikmordere arsonists, and killed the visiting Ambassador Valdritch with his entire retinue.  Now with the imminent arrival of a Klavekian Prince on the anniversary of the tragedy has stirred up both memories of the fire and the spirits of those consumed in the flames.</i><br><i>Can the party get to the bottom of what is going on before the prince sets foot in town? Will the spirits of those who suffered from the arsonists attack get their revenge? Will the Vikmordere try to instigate another assassination attempt? And who is the mysterious woman occasionally seen in the shadows around the new lodge?</i><br>An adventure for 4-6 keen-witted PCs of levels 7-9 who arent afraid of the dark!<br><i>Also included in Haunting at Rybalka Lodge:</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The Incorporeal Inquisitor, a new class for your players!<br></li><li>Loads of New Magic Items: Capture Crystals, Release Crystal Orbs, Circlet of Destinations, Ring of Light Effects, Illusory Glass<br></li><li>New Location: Rybalka Lodge<br></li><li>Todd Gambles Maps of Awesomseness</li></ul><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included Pathfinder Ruleset.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong></strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included Pathfinder RPG and D&amp;D 3.5/ OGL ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
