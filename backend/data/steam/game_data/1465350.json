    "description": "Welcome to Model City, a calm relaxing simple game where you can't lose or do anything wrong. This is not a true city builder game, more of a tabletop model city builder.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you want to, you can maximise the value of your city. You click on tiles and select what type of zoning you want to apply; residential, commercial, industrial, agriculture, or a park, and based on what is already surrounding your selection the value of your city will increase accordingly. There's no resource management or waiting, you just keep on clicking on tiles and select the zoning you want to apply to maximise value. The key is to maintain land balance, which is to maintain the correct ratio of each of the land tile types and then try and apply zoning where it will yield the maximum value. As the tiles in your city increase in value you'll see your residential and commercial zones level up and the next level of buildings will spawn on those tiles (just adds a bit more visual variation).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is short and I think you'll be able to complete your city in less than an hour. You can't lose, you could only just do a bit better or accomplish the final achievement. The best way I could describe Model City is that I've developed it to try and be a calm relaxing type of game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease do watch the video to see the gameplay. Thanks for dropping by.",
