    "description": "Abandoned is a short light thriller walkthrough game testing the players common sense and instincts. Such as where to look and what to interact with to find the correct path to complete their objective. While in the process of all that, there are a few non-normal events. You wont have anyone or anything telling you where to look, which is where everything comes into play. Keep in mind that the most simplest idea may be the best idea. Imagine being in this situation.....what would you check first....<br />\r\n<br />\r\n*Abandoned was built on a learning process, reviews with pros and cons will be taken into consideration to work on for future projects*",
