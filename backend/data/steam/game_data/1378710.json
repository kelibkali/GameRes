    "description": "Lorne Volley gets spammed. &quot;Find Your Soulmate,&quot; it says. Silly. Pathetic. An obvious scam.<br><br>He responds.<br><br><i>Twice.</i> <br><br>The next day he bumps into twin strangers who look alike, talk alike, and don't seem to know the other exists.<br><br>You're Lorne's silent Muse. His guiding hand. His Jiminy Cricket.<br><br>Draw him from his loneliness to connect with acquaintances, reunite with family, and explore the ebbing romances of two distant cities. Maybe you'll unravel his doppelganger dilemma and reveal &quot;true&quot; love. Or maybe he'll end up alone.<br><br>This is a mystery at its heart, not a love story. Yet, the bond between romance and mystery is always tighter than it first appears. Enter this narrative like a detective, inspecting the crime scene that is placebo love.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >KEY EXPERIENCES</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>FOMO:</strong> Navigate a tight schedule of diverse bonds<br></li><li><strong>HONESTY:</strong> Choose when to tell the truth or hide those feelings<br></li><li><strong>FUTURES:</strong> Unlock multiple endings by juggling contacts<br></li><li><strong>INSPIRATION:</strong> Be the gentle push and pull of lonely lives</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >OTHER FEATURES OF NOTE</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Narratively rich. Like a dense brownie made of book parts. Expect a lot of good reading.<br></li><li>Gorgeous soundtrack by Lannie &quot;Merlandese&quot; Neely III and Fernando &quot;Ferdk&quot; Carabajal. We're proud of it.<br></li><li>LGBTQ+ inclusion.<br></li><li>A schedule system. That's the heart of it. Think of, like, a Persona game but with none of the dungeon-y stuff.<br></li><li>Alcohol is represented and in some cases abused. Be careful.<br></li><li>Sex is implied and mentioned in some cases, but is never the focus.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >WHAT NOT TO EXPECT</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A harem. There are many people to spend time with, but not in the &quot;romantic&quot; or &quot;sexual&quot; way.<br></li><li>True love. We don't know what that is. The best on offer is a placebo.<br></li><li>Simple solutions. Not everything will become completely clear by the end, like life.</li></ul>",
