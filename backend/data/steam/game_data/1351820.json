I believe demos are great for people to try out an experience and see if it resonates with them without committing to a price point.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Why I made this</h2><br>Over the past 9 months, I created Shivering Hearts by myself with RPG Maker MV in my free time to show my artistic skills. I also wanted to create something that brings back the magic that I sorely miss from old school 1990s PC RPGs like Baldur's Gate 2, Fallout 1, 2, and Planescape; Torment. CLANNAD, Undertale, LISA: the Painful RPG, and Oneshot were also huge influences. <br><br>Role Playing Games can be so much more than combat, stats, character builds and optimal play (however, I still value these game design aspects very, very much). I wanted to challenge myself to see if I can still create an engaging experience that doesn't have combat or leveling mechanics, within a 1 month period. That turned into 10 months. I wanted to make a game with deep conversation trees, memorable characters and an emotionally touching story. RPG Maker MV allowed me to create and bug-test very intricate dialogue trees that match the quality and scale of those older titles but at the fraction of the development time and with plenty of polish. I hope that I have done those games justice.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1351820/extras/acc2f5e5ca5a4ce12feae3a79971c6fa.poster.avif?t=1595890797\" width=616 height=346 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1351820/extras/acc2f5e5ca5a4ce12feae3a79971c6fa.webm?t=1595890797\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1351820/extras/acc2f5e5ca5a4ce12feae3a79971c6fa.mp4?t=1595890797\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
