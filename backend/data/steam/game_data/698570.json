    "description": "WackIt is a wacky action packed VR whacking experience. The goal is simple, whack moles with your mallet. If you do a good enough job, you will progress to more difficult levels, and if you do a really good job, you will get the tools to whack like you've never whacked before.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMods: This game allows the user to replace the moles with whatever model they would like. Simply add a folder called 'MoleModels' into the 'Resources' folder, and add .obj and .mtl files! Try putting a model of your boss! Or anyone else you think deserves a good whacking!",
