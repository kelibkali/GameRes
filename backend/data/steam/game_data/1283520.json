The neon void is filled with creatures called bugs, which you may want to kill in order to both survive and increase your stats. Throughout the gameplay, you may discover a series of notes that can also increase your stats and clarify the plot.<br>At the ending, depending on the choices you've made, you might expect different endings.<br>*WARNING: This video game may potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy.
