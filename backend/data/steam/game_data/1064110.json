    "description": "Inspired by old school arcade shooters, mixed with roguelike elements, Drill Dash is set in a post-apocalyptic world where mech-equipped drillers are launched from railgun platforms into a vast environment full of destructive raiders, haywire robots and mutated locals. To survive this harsh landscape, you are equipped with a massive rocket propelled drill arm which enables you to defend yourself as you drill underground and through the air in search of the all important Loot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSmash through obstacles and enemies alike in this procedurally generated world as you venture further into hostile lands. Collect Loot and return to base to upgrade your drill suit to take on tougher challenges you'll encounter on your runs.<br />\r\nTravel far enough and you'll encounter power bosses blocking your way forward who will test your skills and reward you with tons of Loot.<br />\r\nSee if you have what it takes to survive, upgrade and drill your way to riches and glory!",
