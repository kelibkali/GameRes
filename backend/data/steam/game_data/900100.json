    "description": "With this puzzle box, we are starting a new puzzle collection based on our favorite classical painter Thomas Cole* and his wonderful series <strong>The Voyage of Life</strong>. In the first painting, <strong>Childhood</strong>, all the important story elements of the series are introduced: the voyager, the angel, the river, and the expressive landscape. An infant is safely ensconced in a boat guided by an angel. The landscape is lush; everything is calm and basking in warm sunshine, reflecting the innocence and joy of childhood. The boat glides out of a dark, craggy cave which Cole himself described as &quot;emblematic of our earthly origin, and the mysterious Past.&quot; The river is smooth and narrow, symbolizing the sheltered experience of childhood. The figurehead on the prow holds an hourglass representing time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Content Details</h2>Contains <i>one</i> new puzzle box for Masters of Puzzle. The UHD image captures the original painting in great detail which in turn allows for very detailed and diverse puzzle tiles. There are a few sections with similar patterns but they can be easily separated from each other. The big variety of colors and several very distinct elements also make it possible to focus and reconstruct the image on stages. In overall, this puzzle should provide a medium challenge for the experienced puzzle builder.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/900100/extras/6de88d7055a24b8806cab6ef2eb5c88e.webp?t=1572466168\" width=32 height=32 /></span> * <i>Note: The painting used in this DLC is in the public domain in its country of origin and other countries and areas where the copyright term is the author's life plus 100 years or less.</i>",
