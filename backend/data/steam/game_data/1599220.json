    "description": "League Space is a primarily first person &quot;MULTIPLAYER&quot; space shooter game. You will be able to move through the magnetic fields of the sphere and you will place yourself in a very large sphere with 2 starting bases. Each base has a maximum of 20 people, that is, 20 vs. 20. The game consists of taking down the entire enemy team and if a whole team is killed, the opposing team wins. It's a bit tricky at first, fun and entertaining. Of course you can shoot your team, you have to be careful with friendly fire.",
