I did not reach my original goal of developing a full <strong>single-player campaign alongside the wave shooter mode</strong>. However, as some players requested, I’ve kept the finished aspects of the game available for those who want to explore them.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Thank you to everyone who supported this project—hopefully, we’ll see you for the next adventure!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>VR: Under a Desert Sun</strong> places you in the heart of a classic pulp adventure, reminiscent of the action-packed stories from old movies.
