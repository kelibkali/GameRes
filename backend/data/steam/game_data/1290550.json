    "description": "Curing Covid is a falling block puzzle game. Match 4 colors in a row to clear blocks. Clear all virus blocks to win the stage and progress through all 20 levels. The title menu features a level select and every stage features a reset button in case all hope is lost. Stacking blocks to high causes you to lose the stage and have to start over.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInspired by retro games of the same genre. Curing Covid started as a solo project for an indie game jam with the theme &quot;Quarantine&quot; and slowly morphed into a 20 stage block puzzle game with an original dubstep theme song and virus sprites.",
