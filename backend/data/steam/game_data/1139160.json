Get help from an unexpected place--a wandering Abeyan father and daughter, Habar and Niomi who have a secret they vowed to never reveal. Meet and recruit the fencer Celeste, the daughter of one of the richest men in all of Kairon. Navigate needing the help of a monk named Gall who hates Ailfred for his role in the destruction of his homeland. There are nine main characters in total--each with unique personalities, motives, and story arcs. Each character also brings different strategic tool sets to overcome your seemingly insurmountable foes.<br><br>The battle system of Divided Reigns has been redesigned from the ground up to make each battle fun, challenging, and feel fresh. Different weapons grant the character wielding it different attack types. Does the enemy have a steel breastplate? Thrust attacks will probably not work well, but Side or Trip attacks might! Just found out the enemy is weak to ranged attacks? Swap that greatsword for a crossbow mid-battle to maximize your attacks. Use the enemy art to try to guess which of the eight different types of attacks will work best, find those weaknesses, and exploit them!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1139160/extras/8fd92710c1cda115acaa0dab6b7cbde5.poster.avif?t=1727114846\" width=614 height=238 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1139160/extras/8fd92710c1cda115acaa0dab6b7cbde5.webm?t=1727114846\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1139160/extras/8fd92710c1cda115acaa0dab6b7cbde5.mp4?t=1727114846\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Nostalgia Addict Games is a small indie video game developer who truly cares about the craft and art of creating great games.
