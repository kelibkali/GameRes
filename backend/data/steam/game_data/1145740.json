    "description": "In Search of a Home (ISH) is a strategy rogue-like space exploration game where you lead a small fleet of ships and people out into unknown galaxies to find a new home. With your resources and population dwindling, you must do your best to balance the morale of your fleet, curry favor with different factions, research new technologies, and explore the galaxy for resources. Not everyone will make it to your new home, and not everything is essential. You’ll have to make hard choices to keep the fleet united on your mission to find a planet to call home.",
