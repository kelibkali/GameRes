    "description": "Hello Anna. I hope you can see this. I made a game for you. We can play together as we used to. It's a point &amp; click game where you explore the labyrinth under the bed. Just find the place to hide, and I'll try to find you. I know how much you like to play hide and seek.<br><br>If you are not my Anna but you know where she is then tell her about this game. However, you are not allowed to play this game. It is only for Anna.<br><br><strong>Game Features</strong><br><br><strong>[Unique Gameplay]</strong><br>Become the operator of a remotely controlled robot and wander through  the cardboard maze under the bed.<br><br><strong>[Unsettling World]</strong><br>The graphics were based on carefully prepared photos. Everything looks as if it was happening in reality, which makes the horror scenes ever scarier.<br><br><strong>[Rich Universe]</strong><br>This game is part of a larger series called Darkness Under My Bed.
