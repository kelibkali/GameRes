    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > D&amp;D Classics: B7 Rahasia (Basic)</h2>Gray Mountain lies deep in the lush elven forest. The temple there was a haven of meditation and learning until taken over by an evil cleric known as the Rahib.<br>Far under the mountain, he paces before the temple's great altar. A brown-robed servant rushes in and falls to his knees, trembling at the sight of the Rahib's black panther. &quot;Rahib, adventurers came to the village as the sun rose - the strangers now protect Rahasia.&quot;<br>A scowl crosses the Rahib's face. &quot;I must have Rahasia! Attack again tonight.&quot; As the servant scurries away, a deep growl rises from the giant cat.<br>Gripping the panther's leash, the Rahib paces again, speaking out loud. &quot;We must dispose of these strangers quickly; the secret beneath the temple will not wait much longer.&quot; For characters levels 1-3.<br>We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today.

This content is presented as it was originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed.
