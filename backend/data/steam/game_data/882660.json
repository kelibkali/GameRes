    "description": "Galdur features sprawling procedurally generated dungeons, a top-down fast paced twin-stick combat and spell crafting. It's akin to a roguelike except it features progression in the form of expanding your spell crafting capabilities to craft a vast array of spells and by obtaining new passive abilities that synergize with your builds.<br><br>I can't promise more detailed features just yet as the game is not close enough to release.<br><br><i>NOTE: THIS GAME IS STILL VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT. WE'RE USING LOTS OF PLACEHOLDERS AND ALMOST EVERYTHING RELATED TO THE GAME'S CORE DESIGN IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE.</i>",
