It is setup as a thrilling murder mystery and acts as a contrast to the somewhat calm and enjoyable gameplay. <br>You fly towards another memory piece and collect it. <br>Once you collected the memory piece a nearby book opens and a couple of words are floating out of the book.<br>Just like that the environment will often react and reflect on the advancing story and will abstractly represent some of the things that happen in the story and that are on the mind of the young boy. <br><br>The first levels are quite straight forward but the further you advance the more surreal and abstracted the levels become. <br>Once you have finished a chapter by collecting all memory pieces and finishing the overall story of a level you will continue into the next chapter. <br>There are 15 chapters in total and each abstractly represents the story part that you are currently experiencing and has its very own theme and twist to the story.",
