The death of the Net King, the mighty leader who united the internet, has resulted in a dangerous power vacuum. There are many who have tried and failed to find the Net King’s Fortress and seize the power within but none have found success. After years of fruitless effort, most have given up on the Fortress ever returning and believe that the Net is doomed to disarray. But a young man has come along, who refuses to accept this fate.  Peter Matthews has ventured into the desolate Wildlands of the Net, seeking to reinstate the laws of the Net King by finding his fortress. The journey will be long, perilous, and lined with potential friends and foes. Peter and his allies will be tested at every turn but they will stand firm, determined to finally heed the Net Kings Call.&quot;</i>",
