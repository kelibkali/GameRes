In each round you mine for gold, treasures and other specialty items that might aid you. You also have to watch out and combat other miners until the last one is standing or when the timer runs out. In between the rounds you purchase and equip better weapons, bombs and items. You are scored points for various things including mining minerals and defeating other miners. The winner is the one with the highest score after the final round.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li><strong>Connect</strong> with up to 10 players in local area network or internet<br>    </li><li><strong>Explore</strong> the randomly generated maps<br>    </li><li><strong>Take Advantage</strong> of the fully destructible terrain<br>    </li><li><strong>Employ Various Strategies</strong> with the array of weapons, bombs and items<br>    </li><li><strong>Chance the Pace</strong> with different game modes (Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Team Capture The Base, Soccer, Coop Endless)<br>    </li><li><strong>Laugh</strong> as you bombard your friends with an exploding duck or blast them in the face with a shotgun.<br></li><li><strong>Create</strong> your own multiplayer maps with the in-game Map Editor and share the creations on Steam Workshop</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Mine Bombers?</h2><br>Skitso Productions developed their classic hot seat multiplayer game Mine Bombers in 1995.
