    "description": "&quot;Flesh and blood&quot; jazz musicians have made this<strong> original soundtrack</strong> what it always set out to be: humane and unique at every registered note. Irresistible, gloomy and fatally seductive in its entirety.<br><br>Recorded in a live-act environment, under the proverbial &quot;whip&quot; of azorean composer Cristóvão Ferreira, six impactful tracks help Pecaminosa invoke a soundscape that highlights vintage jazz and the noir genre.<br><br>With original soundtrack references like Les Liaison Dangereuses (Art Blakey), Ascenseur pour l’échafau (Miles Davis) and Touch of Evil (Henry Mancini), this &quot;made in Azores&quot; noir jazz is going out at the crack of dawn and would like to take you for a ride through obscure, noisy alleyways, smoke-filled bars and stolen kisses. Are you in?",
