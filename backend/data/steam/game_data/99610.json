    "description": "The Polynesian Scenario Pack brings you both the Polynesian Civilization and a new Scenario, Paradise Found. Rule the world as Kamehameha, unifier of Hawai'i, with your powerful navy and imposing Moai statues!<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Scenario Description</strong><br>\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Paradise Found, players take on the role of one of the four great Polynesian kingdoms as they strive to become the dominant culture in Polynesia. All-new technology and social policy trees unlock powerful advantages to players, including the fearsome Maori Warrior and the enigmatic Moai. Special changes to the game rules allow players to build expansive kingdoms quickly without impeding their cultural growth, but the seas of the Pacific are huge and land is at a premium  among the atolls and islands. Take the best islands for yourself, and prove your mana as a ruler as you build Polynesia to stand the test of time!<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Polynesia Ruler – Kamehameha</strong><br>\t\t\t\t\t\tKamehameha was the first ruler to unite all of the Big Islands of Hawai'i under his rule in 1791, and reformed many of the island's laws to protect its people. Because of his strong rule and wise policies, Hawai’i remained an independent kingdom long after Kamehameha’s death in 1819.",
