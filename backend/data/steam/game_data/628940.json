Liz has to investigate environments using advanced tools supported by her drone, B-4, in different ways.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Shooting</h2>While Liz investigates on location, she is attacked by the people working there. The threats must be managed with the utmost firmness to avoid compromising the mission. Violence must be contained in order to complete the mission. Liz has a weapon supplied, a handgun, and she will use it to defend herself.<br>Sometimes It’s not so easy to get rid of threats: sometimes you have to cover a wounded ally or escort a survivor and you’re not the only one to defend.",
