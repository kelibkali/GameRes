While the story-driven nature guides you, the <strong>large open areas</strong> of the game world are meant to be explored. Every nook and cranny holds a small story, things to scavenge or loot to make your live just a little bit easier. Make no mistake though, the world is not devoid of danger and the environment and wildlife are not to your only enemies. There are much darker secrets lurking in the shadows.<br><br>Scavenging and crafting play a major role and processing scavenged items to craft or improve your gear go hand in hand with exploring the game world. Don’t worry, you don’t need to haul everything you might need with you as you can build bases or adapt existing locations to your needs with the <strong>game’s building system</strong>.<br><br>There is even a <strong>mobile base of operations</strong> at your disposal when you find a large plane someone tried to turn into a boat. You will need a lot of resources to finish, repair and maintain it, but then you can use it to travel along the many rivers. You can use the building system to build it up even further by upgrading it to provide accommodations, crafting stations and even defenses.<br><br> <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1179020/extras/9c882b2f33bdb56c0142ff48f9f183d7.poster.avif?t=1771421069\" width=610 height=210 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1179020/extras/9c882b2f33bdb56c0142ff48f9f183d7.webm?t=1771421069\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1179020/extras/9c882b2f33bdb56c0142ff48f9f183d7.mp4?t=1771421069\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>The ever-present corruption affects every living organism in the area. It will affect you, too. How you deal with it is what really matters. It poses a real danger to you and it will be a constant battle for control. It is also very alluring: dangerous on one side, but not without some serious benefits on the other allowing you to perform inhuman feats. You just have to keep it under control…<br><br><br><i>&quot;Waking up years after you were ordered to launch a nuclear missile beside your dead best friend gives you a solid clue things went sideways.
