    "description": "Using data from high-resolution electron microscopy we have reconstructed a human breast cancer cell in 3D VR in order to better visualise mechanisms of nanoparticle internalisation and trafficking. These virtual environments allow users to walk on a cancer cell, exploring and learning about cellular anatomy and processes. This is a VR experience and currently is only compatible with Oculus Rift.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a collaborative project developed by the 3d Visualisation Aesthetics Lab (3DVAL) at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) Art and Design, funded by the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence in Bio-Nano Science and Technology (CBNS).",
