(WASD, ETC)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game has no Set Difficulty so, prepare to be challenged continuously.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is a SAVE GAME option however, the game was designed to only save data when the computer is ON. Cutting your computer off will delete your saved information for security reasons. (Any type of virus scanning, malware prevention or other software keeping your computer clean will see Fallen Beast &quot;Saves&quot; as a threat to your system and could automatically delete the game data itself. This has caused issues during testing) There is a backup for such an action, Fallen Beast contains a small Password System that allows you to play each chapter's areas once they've been reached.<br />\r\nHope you enjoy.",
