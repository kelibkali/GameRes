    "description": "In the kingdom of Segunda, the Crown Prince’s birthday celebrations are traditionally where he is expected to choose a bride. Your mother, the Duchess of Florentia, is very keen for her only daughter to become the next queen, so she sends you and your mischievous brother, Frederique, along with your family’s steward, Bastien, to the fortnight-long celebrations. Of course, just because your mother has her gaze fixed upon the Prince, does not mean you must follow suit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWill you act like the perfect lady and convince the King to select you as the Prince's betrothed, or show your true colours and perhaps catch another's eye?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDecisions made in the outset of the game will determine your personality - with possibilities ranging from a diplomatic scholar to a bawdy hellion - and these, in turn, will open additional conversation options and scenarios that can help or hinder your relationships with those around you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame features:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n+ Approximately 100,000 words<br />\r\n<br />\r\n+ 6 romance paths (4 male, 2 female)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n+ 26 beautiful CGs<br />\r\n<br />\r\n+ An enchanting score",
