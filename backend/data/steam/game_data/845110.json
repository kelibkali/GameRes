As you grow longer, take care to protect your segments or risk getting split in two.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Snakelike Twistings with some Roguelike Action</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Eat apples to grow in length.

Each individual Segment can acquire Armor and Spikers which level up.

There’s no MP or cooldown period. The only thing preventing you from casting a spell every turn is the fact that you’ll need to re-contort yourself into the pattern.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Bosses, Shops &amp; Puzzles</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Challenge larger-than-(snake)life Bosses in search of powerful Snakecessories, barter your segments for a stack of Armor, or wrap your mind–and body–around some truly snake-twisting puzzles.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Dynamic Soundtrack</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>As you slither around the cave, the soundtrack changes based on your surroundings hinting at impending doom or enviable riches.</li></ul>",
