Unlike you, each can collect randomly spawning elemental orbs, granting them new and interesting powers, such as setting players and the map on fire, drenching everything in water and moving them around with spray, or summoning dirt to act as shield. Elements combine, giving you the ability to answer the age-old question: What happens when a superheated rock meets a face?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1075880/extras/2a20c089c2bddd7fb85f4e769a0146a2.poster.avif?t=1768323807\" width=780 height=316 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1075880/extras/2a20c089c2bddd7fb85f4e769a0146a2.webm?t=1768323807\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1075880/extras/2a20c089c2bddd7fb85f4e769a0146a2.mp4?t=1768323807\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>But It's Not All About Violence</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Oh no. Every round is different thanks to randomly selected mini-games players can complete instead of just racing to get their favorite combination of elements. Don't feel like smacking your best friend across the map? How about a Totem mode, where you need to collect the pieces and defend them from the other team? Or Fire vs. Ice, where you compete to prevent the destruction of ice statues by the fiery fury of the other team? Everyone has a chance to win, not just the ones fastest on the draw!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1075880/extras/35747bffe7deab9554c08b3a8466f868.poster.avif?t=1768323807\" width=780 height=316 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1075880/extras/35747bffe7deab9554c08b3a8466f868.webm?t=1768323807\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1075880/extras/35747bffe7deab9554c08b3a8466f868.mp4?t=1768323807\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Also, It's the Maps</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > Between the elements and the mini-games are the maps themselves. Forget about static arenas made of indestructibilium! Here you can set things on fire, freeze them, turn puddles into deadly steam traps, deploy turrets and caltrops, and experiment to your heart's content by combining elements with map environments to create fun new ways to get the drop on the other team - or see them backfire spectacularly, which is part of the fun, right?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1075880/extras/ceae4e6b2df67eb5526c2251f7fd158f.poster.avif?t=1768323807\" width=780 height=316 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1075880/extras/ceae4e6b2df67eb5526c2251f7fd158f.webm?t=1768323807\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1075880/extras/ceae4e6b2df67eb5526c2251f7fd158f.mp4?t=1768323807\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Not a One and Done</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Elemental Brawl is in for the long haul!
