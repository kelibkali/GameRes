    "description": "Our gameplay is a love letter to the AKI classics of the Nintendo 64 era, <i>WCW/nWo Revenge</i> and <i>WWF No Mercy</i>, and we're taking full advantage of current game engine technology. We're delivering a gaming experience that looks modern but feels fun and familiar. <strong>A game made BY wrestling fans, FOR wrestling fans.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Our Philosophy</h2><br>Our mission with Pro Wrestling X is clear and attainable: <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Focus on simple-but-deep gameplay mechanics that are FUN!<br></li><li> Build a game that's open and moddable. Give PC gamers the freedom and tools to create and share new content.<br></li><li> Create a wrestling game platform that evolves and grows – and never goes backwards.<br></li><li> The ultimate goal: the fun of WWF No Mercy + the depth of Fire Pro Wrestling.<br></li><li> Give love and respect to pro wrestling for the memories it has given us.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Roadmap to 1.0</h2><br>Thanks to a successful Kickstarter, we're committed to delivering the following functionality for our 1.0 release:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Movement – Standard D-pad/stick directional movement; running/Irish whips; climb turnbuckle; enter/exit ring to floor; block/perry/escape (think <i>WWF No Mercy</i>); pick up downed opponent; taunt; pinfall attempt.<br></li><li> Grappling – 4 front grapple moves; 2 back grapple moves; 1 corner grapple; 1 special/finisher.<br></li><li> Striking/submission – 3 strikes; 2 ground submissions; 1 ground strike; 2 flying turnbuckle moves.<br></li><li> Extras – 3 playable characters; 1 base arena; blue steel cage (made most famous in <i>WWF Wrestlefest</i>); &quot;international objects&quot; (aka weapons).<br></li><li> Controls – Keyboard and USB gamepad support (XBox 360 controller compatible)</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Current Status: Early Access</h2><br>Pro Wrestling X is an Early Access title, probably not for the faint of heart. We've started with basic movement, striking and grappling, and as we perfect each mechanism, we'll keep adding more. <strong>If you are looking for a complete game and don't want to see how the sausage is made, hold off for now.</strong> Add us to your Wishlist and circle back in a bit!<br><br>If, however, you want to witness a wrestling game get developed from the ground up and have your voice heard along the way, hop aboard the crazy train. There may be bugs and glitches and a not-so-deep experience on day one, but we're not going to stop – and <strong>we'd love your help!</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Nice things said about us</h2><br><i>&quot;I'm very happy to make a donation for this. Best of luck as always and hope to see this come to completion!&quot;</i><br><strong>– Producer of WWF No Mercy, Sanders Keel, backing our Kickstarter</strong><br><br><i>&quot;it's been a long-road for the game so far... we're betting that its passionate developers won't be pinned to the mat quite so easily.&quot;</i><br><strong>– PC Gamer</strong><br><br><i>&quot;...An independently developed game that aimed to bring back the glory days of No Mercy was a thing that I very much wanted to play.&quot;</i><br><strong>– </strong><br><br><i>&quot;With Pro Wrestling X ... coming out, the future of wrestling games could be bright once more.&quot;</i><br><strong>– Kotaku UK</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Stay in touch</h2><br>We're all over the Interweb. We send out an email newsletter with project updates every Friday, and we post pretty regularly to Facebook and Twitter. Come find us:<br><br><br><br>Join the email list: ",
