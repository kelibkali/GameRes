Your goal is to figure out which symbol belongs in each space of a grid in the fewest moves possible, but you can approach this goal in many different ways. You might, for example, guess only one symbol at a time. This will give you clear feedback about each guess, but might be slower than making several guesses at once. You might focus on a single type of symbol (such as Sun) or try to clear several at once. There are a number of advanced strategies to discover and master as you experiment with the best ways to solve different puzzles.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2099390/extras/76a80e374d661560943e0cee174b044c.avif?t=1682293119\" width=451 height=90 /></span><br><br>The modifier levels will force you to develop new strategies or refine ones you have already discovered. For example, in &quot;Stacking&quot; you may only make guesses on the bottom row at first. This means you need to find ways to quickly gain information with small, localized guesses. By contrast, &quot;One-by-one&quot; only allows you to make guesses with a single symbol until you have found all of it's locations in the grid. This modifier requires gaining information about a wide area quickly, but restricts your ability to gather information about multiple symbols at once.",
