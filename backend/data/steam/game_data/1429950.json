    "description": "<i>Apotheker</i> is a story-driven logic puzzle game where you must learn the delicate art of potion-brewing through thoughtful use of ingredients, tools, and funds. Use your resources in the most efficient way possible to maximize your profits for every potion - alternatively, what exactly would happen if you gave fermented slugs and cigarette ashes to help soothe a baby? Science is all about experimentation, after all!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1429950/extras/36a25a71d370f52a3475afe80ddecca2.poster.avif?t=1648226455\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1429950/extras/36a25a71d370f52a3475afe80ddecca2.webm?t=1648226455\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1429950/extras/36a25a71d370f52a3475afe80ddecca2.mp4?t=1648226455\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Add ingredients to your cauldron to change the effects of your creation.
