    "description": "In this first episode of the Adam's Ascending saga, you will embark on a short, yet fulfilling journey that will reignite feelings of nostalgia from the more simpler times of gaming. <br><br><strong>- No radars.<br>- No hints.<br>- No hand holding. <br>- No Auto-Saving.</strong><br><br>You'll only have your wits and game environments to lead the way. The course and progression of the story path is entirely in your hands. And while this may make the game more difficult, the overall experience will be much more rewarding and eye opening at the end.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1110210/extras/a4272de2e0978331aa6af67a97b0b45d.avif?t=1634579962\" width=650 height=74 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1110210/extras/7b358eaf5e4d5738b246219d4a90ecdc.poster.avif?t=1634579962\" width=600 height=304 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1110210/extras/7b358eaf5e4d5738b246219d4a90ecdc.webm?t=1634579962\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1110210/extras/7b358eaf5e4d5738b246219d4a90ecdc.mp4?t=1634579962\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Explore the mysterious island of Damascus: a powerful, and dimensional paradise that holds the past, present, and future of your soul.

This has been a journey of growth and revelation as a self taught developer. My hope with Adams Ascending is to be a voice for inspiring others to &quot;ascend&quot; into their own dreams, no matter how impossible it may be. I'm humbled to have the opportunity to share the story of Adam's Ascending with the world. Thanks for your time! Keep inspiring.<br><br>Best,<br>Nick DePalo",
