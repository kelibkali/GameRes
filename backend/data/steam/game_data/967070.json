But <i>you are no monster</i>, and so you are also tasked with ensuring only those offering their implied consent are availed to such ritual slaughter.  Practice democracy from above, using social conformity and applied pressure to ensure the valve remains open, the offering both ethically sourced and guilt-free.  Can you reconcile the will of the gods with the naive will of the people?<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/967070/extras/bc58aa6668bed44cf73b77cae1759f89.avif?t=1546036402\" width=600 height=346 /></span>",
