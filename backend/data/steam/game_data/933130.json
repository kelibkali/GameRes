The United States Free Forces leads the resistance, armed with a one-of a kind, building-sized weapon: the Archangel. HUMNX has abundant resources and developed equivalent weapons, but the USFF is determined to take freedom back. Rise from the rubble and prepare for combat: You are the last, best hope of the free.<br><br><strong>Current Events - Year 2099</strong><br>After a few strategic USFF victories, HUMNX has adapted. In response to the Archangel weapon, the incredibly resourceful corporation deployed three new, state-of-the-art mechs featuring advanced movement and weapons systems. The USFF rises to the new challenge and initiates automated, mechanized war-machine construction to increase their own mech roster to an equivalent level.<br><br>Conscious of their inability to keep pace with HUMNX enhancements, USFF weapons strike the largest enemy Mech Replication site, Genesis Facility. HUMNX immediately retaliates. The ensuing war results in extensive destruction and far too many casualties. When The Great Mech Wars end, who will be left to reclaim our shattered world?",
