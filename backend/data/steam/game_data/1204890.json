We had enough warning to protect ourselves as we saw the distant stars flicker out one by one. Alcyone's old name was forgotten and became simply <strong>the City</strong>.<br><br>Shielded and walled away from the decimation and destruction of the void outside, inhabitants have lived for centuries with the serenity provided by the City's protection. Governed under the benevolence of the <strong>Six Ruling Houses</strong>, humanity continues to demonstrate its tenacity in surviving and adapting to whatever fate befalls it. Normal life continues — after a fashion. We persist.<br><br>But the Six are lying to us.<br><br>And the Nihility is more than we've been told.<br><br>And there's a way out of the City.</i><br><br>- - - - - - - - - - - - <br><br>Alcyone: The Last City is a dynamic, evolving interactive fiction game set in the last city in the universe. Centuries from now, in a society left stagnant, you step into the shoes of a blank slate newly rebirthed.<br><br>It features a riveting plot full of political intrigue, betrayal, and survival. Alcyone's main themes are entropy and decay, and the player is a rogue element capable of breaking this cycle — or taking control over it.<br><br>Choice drives the game and influences the story: more than giving the player the simple appearance of control, your decisions will change the options available to you, dictate the path your experience takes, and heavily decide the end of the game. Will you be a force for destruction, or will your decisions help the existing powers that be? A diverse cast of characters populates the City, and you have the freedom to pick a persona that suits you.<br><br>In addition to hundreds of thousands of words, gorgeous high-resolution, hand-painted digital artwork by Peak Distapan accompanies the game text to bring its writing to life in vivid detail. Alcyone also has a full length soundtrack composed by Michał Korniewicz that thematically supports the story for maximum emotional impact.",
