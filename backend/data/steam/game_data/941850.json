We don’t want to spend 20 minutes walking to an objective, or game rounds lasting over an hour. We want to create an intense and tactical objective-based shooter in a modern engine that is fun to play, yet players still face the threat that a single bullet can end their life. You will find that a well organised squad utilising suppression and manoeuvring as a single fighting unit is the most effective road to success.",
