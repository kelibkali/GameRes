    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > Pathfinder RPG - Campaign Setting: Nidal, Land of Shadows</h2><strong> A Land Chained in Shadow</strong><br>Ten thousand years ago, faced with extinction, the terrified leaders of Nidal heard whispers in their minds--promises of salvation for their nation if only they'd submit their people's bodies and souls to perpetual servitude. Those leaders' assent transformed them into conduits for Zon-Kuthon, the god of envy and pain, and has sealed Nidal's fate to this day.<br><i> Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Nidal, Land of Shadows</i> draws back the curtain from one of Golarion's most wicked and mysterious theocracies. Within these pages, you'll find:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Detailed descriptions of Nidal's history, including its tragic fall into Zon-Kuthon's grasp.<br></li><li>An in-depth gazetteer of the entire nation, from settlements to more sinister features.<br></li><li>Malevolent adventure sites from the Castle of the Captive Sun to the Tower of Slant Shadows.<br></li><li>A bestiary of shadowy creatures, including the suffragan kyton, that lurk in Nidal and beyond.</li></ul><i> Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Nidal, Land of Shadows</i> is intended for use with the Pathfinder campaign setting, but it can be easily adapted to any fantasy world.<br><i> This product is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
