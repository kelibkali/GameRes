It'll never end.&quot;</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Premise</h2>Part of the <strong>&quot;Children of Sorrow&quot;</strong> series, The Sorrowvirus follows the journey of a young man named <strong>Wyatt Heyll</strong>, who, from a very young age, has been stricken with a multitude of ailments, cancers and illnesses. On the verge of death, his parents gave him a paranormal substance known as the Sorrowvirus, which contaminates the human soul; preventing it from passing onto the afterlife when they die.<br><br>This causes them to fall to <strong>Purgatory</strong> instead, where they can heal and eventually return to life. However, every time Wyatt comes back to life, his cancers and illnesses return quicker than before. Wyatt's parents allow him to continue dying over and over while they perform research on organic particles found in Purgatory that may cure him once and for all.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Gameplay</h2>Wyatt, having died so many times, simply wants to let go; both his mind and soul are shattered. <strong>Your objective is to set Wyatt free from his everlasting torment.</strong> With four endings in sight, only one is the true ending, will you endeavour to help Wyatt set himself free on time? Time is something that can easily slip away from you in Purgatory, keep track of time by interacting with grandfather clocks scattered across Purgatory. For those who dislike time-management games, there is a wristwatch that can be found after the first instance so that you don't have to keep track of time.<br><br>The Sorrowvirus is a First-Person Story Adventure designed to be played in one sitting that lasts approximately 45-60 minutes. <strong>There are no save points.</strong> However, the game will remember how many times you've completed it; causing the game's dialogue, environments and difficulty to change while you discover the other endings. To experience the game in its entirety, all four instances should be played! Breaks can be taken in-between instances, as the game remembers how many times you've completed it.",
