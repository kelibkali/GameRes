    "description": "It's been 30 years since a terrible arson attack erased an entire family. Until today the culprit has been on the loose. You are sent to investigate a similar incident in this narrative exploration game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIrresponsible police detective (and part-time alcoholic) Gary Price is sent to investigate the murder of forest ranger Mike Hill. This is Gary’s last chance to save his job, as his boss Chief Gonzales grows impatient. Navigate Gary through this narrative exploration game and discover the truth about Mike Hill’s death!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story of Scorch takes place in Beaverton, Oregon. As you play the game you can take in the beautiful scenery of the Tualatin Hills Nature Park. Uncover small mysterious as you interact with the environment: opening doors, drawers, even messing with the TV.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGonzales will give you calls in regular intervals to check up on you and make sure you're not slacking off. Keep in mind you only have one day to solve the case. Finally, be wary of calling in the suspect: you only get one shot to answer her questions at the end.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInside the game Gary can use his phone to organize and inspect evidence, answer calls from Gonzales, and review memos he receives while playing the game. Scorch features an original soundtrack and full voice acting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you're a fan of Firewatch and Gone Home, you'll love this game.",
