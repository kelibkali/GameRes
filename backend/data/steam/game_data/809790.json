If you can't endure it, you can't endure whole game, so that's trial.</strong><br><br>Nightmare simulator is a first-person exploration horror game. Discover surreal places from hell and enter 16 different nightmares. Each scenario is set in a unique world with its own atmosphere. Music and surreal places recreate a creepy atmosphere from your worst nightmares. This isn't a game about jumpscares; the horror stems from the atmosphere itself. Scenes are as surreal as in a dream where nothing makes sense. You walk as a tormented soul and discover disturbing places from the subconscious. Whenever you wake up, you return to the wheel of misfortune which will choose yet another nightmare for you to roam. The nightmares never end, since whenever you wake up you go to another nightmare.<br><br>Game shows nightmares from Lukas Eathrabari mind from game Psychiatrist Simulator",
