Read on!</h2>Ever miss being a child, playing games at your grandma's or in your old bedroom? Then look no further! The Adventures of Elena Temple is the classic you never knew existed. And the best part is that you can play it on virtual old machines that kind of sort of maybe existed. It's not like you can remember for sure anyway, right?<br><br><br>The Adventures of Elena Temple is a monochromatic puzzle platformer made to look as if it were created in the 80s. Overcome obstacles, figure out how to advance, collect everything in sight, find all the secrets and remember your childhood while doing it. Progress through the game's three dungeons through non-linear exploration, then unlock the new game modifiers and re-experience the game in whole new ways.<br><br>                   <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/800190/extras/d4e3f703b531d6e3c04eab3bbdf34e33.poster.avif?t=1726313949\" width=484 height=130 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/800190/extras/d4e3f703b531d6e3c04eab3bbdf34e33.webm?t=1726313949\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/800190/extras/d4e3f703b531d6e3c04eab3bbdf34e33.mp4?t=1726313949\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>3 dungeons with a total of 100+ rooms to overcome, each its own mini-level<br></li><li>Unique gameplay elements for each dungeon<br></li><li>Open exploration, choose which way to go, but don't worry, a helpful map is just one button press away<br></li><li>Challenging, old-school platforming<br></li><li>Put your puzzle solving skills to the test and figure out how to collect all the coins, gems, hearts and so on<br></li><li>Track the progress of all 40 achievements in-game <br></li><li>Unlockable game modifiers for completely new ways to experience the game<br></li><li>Secrets and easter eggs to find for the more observant player<br></li><li>Play on a selection of 7 virtual old machines, from the Pomo D'or 4, to Maple and Some Toy and all the way to the NS-Bos PC</li></ul><br>  <span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/800190/extras/57658707993340b6ebe2e58a619f0a77.poster.avif?t=1726313949\" width=600 height=400 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/800190/extras/57658707993340b6ebe2e58a619f0a77.webm?t=1726313949\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/800190/extras/57658707993340b6ebe2e58a619f0a77.mp4?t=1726313949\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Heads up</h2>The Adventures of Elena Temple is just one game you can play on seven simulated machines. Aside from the different look, the game plays the same on all machines and has the exact same content! The purpose of these old machines is to remind you of the old days, so feel free to pick whichever you like best without any fear of missing out on game content.<br><br><br>The game should run on most Windows computers that aren't on display in a museum, but if you have one that doesn't run it, you have my deepest sympathy. Just to be safe, you should have at least the below specs.<br><br>I'm a solo indie developer, I loved making The Adventures of Elena Temple and I hope you enjoy it! Please leave me some feedback if you play it.<br><br>Thank you for your support!",
