    "description": "Harry is here and it’s an all new adventure!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJoin the intrepid explorer as he searches for and collects hundreds of golden eggs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGuide Harry from platform to platform, level to level, grabbing every last egg you possibly can! There’s over 35 levels to complete, including new bonus stage levels that are exclusive to this edition of the game. Each level is a tricky mix of platform action with ladders, elevators, enemies and more. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd watch out because just as you think you have everything mastered, Bertha, Harry's arch enemy will join in and she's not friendly to Harry's egg collecting antics! In fact, she's is not going to stop chasing him until she’s put an end to Harry once and for all! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce you've got a few levels under your belt, try one of the other game modes. There's Hard mode that offers a real challenge for even the hardiest of platform warriors. Or, there's Survivor Run: See how far you can get on just one life and try for an 'A' Grade score. It's quite a bit harder than it sounds. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd if that's not enough, Time Trial mode turns Chuckie Egg 2017 into a full-on speed-run competition. See if you can beat our best times, and unlock some achievements if you can! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nChuckie Egg 2017 is a thoroughly modern take on the retro-style platformer game with vibrant art, modern controls and movement, and music that will likely have you humming along while you play.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame Features:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-\t30 main levels spread across three unique themes<br />\r\n-\tFour unique bonus stages.
