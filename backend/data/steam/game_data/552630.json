The brighter the light, the faster the battery drains.</li><li>Use the camera to buy some time.</li><li>Escape.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Useful Information</h2>Currently the flashlight only works with the left controller and the camera only works with the right controller. Teleportation is also limited to the right controller right now. If you're a lefty, feel free to swap controllers on launch, but currently there's no in-game switching. Please keep this in mind if you're considering purchasing.<br><br>The current method of locomotion is teleportation. Touchpad walking is in the works, but may only be included if requested.",
