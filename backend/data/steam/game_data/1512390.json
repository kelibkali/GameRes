Hidden in the hollow of a valley, the village of Sainte-Monique-Des-Monts conceals a secret that weighs heavily on the community. The village is left abandoned. Those who remain can only wait. But something else torments the inhabitants. A shadow prowls around the village. Some saw it, others heard it. They heard it whisper.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1512390/extras/99e9da654d4eaf08fa83157055441626.poster.avif?t=1740158519\" width=598 height=182 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1512390/extras/99e9da654d4eaf08fa83157055441626.webm?t=1740158519\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1512390/extras/99e9da654d4eaf08fa83157055441626.mp4?t=1740158519\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1512390/extras/5fde0055f784f04d570d58e012a93120.webp?t=1740158519\" width=458 height=44 /></span><br><br>Inspired by games such as Scratches and The Dark Eye, The Whispering Valley brings back the classic horror point &amp; click subgenre. You will find the old school adventure features that we all love: puzzle solving, exploring, dialogues, inventory, using and combining objects.<br><br><strong>Exploration</strong><br><br>Dynamic and highly-detailed environments are for you to explore. We created a full-scale village that holds many mysteries. Each door can be opened, each building can be entered. Using the 360° panoramic viewing and the zoom in functionality, you can even examine every little detail that catches your eye. Is it too dark to see? Hold up your lantern to light your surroundings and uncover the horrors that darkness beholds.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1512390/extras/bae9b4df542d77836dfd0e41940133bd.poster.avif?t=1740158519\" width=598 height=182 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1512390/extras/bae9b4df542d77836dfd0e41940133bd.webm?t=1740158519\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1512390/extras/bae9b4df542d77836dfd0e41940133bd.mp4?t=1740158519\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br><strong>Puzzle</strong><br><br>We all enjoy the surreal, mind-binding, over-the-top puzzles in Myst.
