    "description": "This immersive journey takes you deep into the heart of Parliament—a Canadian landmark and architectural masterpiece, whose doors are now closed. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you travel through the building, the spaces around you surge to life with magic realism. Animals spring from stone walls. Empty rooms echo with voices of the past. And figures who helped shape Canada for over 100 years return to take their place in the halls of democracy. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBlending photorealism with vivid sound, colour and light, Parliament: The Virtual Reality Experience is an unforgettable glimpse into the centre of Canadian decision-making. The VR journey is brought to you by the Library of Parliament and the National Film Board of Canada.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRuntime: 15 minutes",
