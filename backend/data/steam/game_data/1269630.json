Idyll will not last too long since a dangerous plague has broken into the city walls and your mission is to find its source and stop the rot from spreading.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >NOTHING UNITES HUMANS LIKE A COMMON ENEMY</h2><br>Recruit cowboys, Indians, National Guard soldiers, Mexicans or even bandits - everyone, regardless of their political views, wants the end of the ugly plague.<br><br>Or Do they?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >BE SMART</h2>Strategically deploy your forces on the map and set up turrets. Hire new members and gain experience to develop your units. Throw away their rusty guns and gear them up with new weapons to make your team even more powerful. Set ambushes to weaken your foes and find out who’s the cause of the overwhelming havoc.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1269630/extras/d415a0462254e323d1a01bdfd0765312.avif?t=1673807238\" width=630 height=220 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >APPROACH BEASTS OF ALL POSSIBLE LEGENDS AND TALES</h2>Fight orcs, demons, skeletons, goblins, trolls, forest creatures and even animals like wolves or bears.
