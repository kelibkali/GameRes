    "description": "Light of Mine is one of the scariest experiences you will have in VR this Halloween. Explore an ancient temple where innocent looking statues come to life, but only when your back is turned.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUse your candle in the darkened temple to find your way and outwit the horrors within. You will spend the rest of your day looking over your shoulder when the headset comes off.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLight of Mine is made by adults on the autism spectrum at nonPareil Studios. We are a studio that provides better futures for adults with autism, providing training in game development, programming, art and design. #PoweredbyAutism",
