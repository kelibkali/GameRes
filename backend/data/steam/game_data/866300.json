    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Nerzugal's Extended Bestiary</strong></h2>This contains only the creatures of Nerzugal's Game Master Toolkit. Some are not interested in One-Shots and Dungeons but might like to expand their arsenal of creatures.<br>With this product, you get all 100 monsters of the GM Toolkit in a single product. All of the unique monsters come with full lore to give ideas for how you might incorporate them into your world. The book also contains 26 original pieces of artwork by Jimmy Brathen to bring these creatures to life.<br>This product includes extensions of existing monster types including: Azer, Kobolds, Elementals, Orcs, Ogres, and more as well many new monsters such as the Light Devourer, The Living Temple, and the Mysterious Starcaller. About 75% of the creatures are CR 5 or below, as I feel the lower levels is where a majority of campaigns live, but if you do have a high-level party there are some interesting and powerful foes that you can throw at your players.<br><i>This product includes:</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>100 creatures<br></li><li>26 images of various monsters<br></li><li>Over 60 Story entries with detailed information about many of the monsters</li></ul><i>Conversion by:</i><strong> Charles Surette</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included 5E ruleset.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Charles Surette</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included 5E Compatible ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
