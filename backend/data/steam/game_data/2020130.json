    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >ABOUT THIS GAME</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Top Down Zombies is a fast, high-pressure top-down shooter built around overwhelming enemy swarms and constant escalation.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >From the moment you spawn, you’re under threat. Enemies surround you, close in, and punish hesitation. Survival depends on movement, awareness, and making the right decisions under pressure.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Endless Waves</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Reddz come in dense, relentless waves that grow faster and deadlier over time. Space disappears quickly, and every mistake tightens the margins.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Online Co-op</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Play solo or team up in online co-op. With friends, the chaos doesn’t disappear... it shifts into shared responsibility when things spiral...</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Progression &amp; Weapons</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Level up during runs to unlock new weapons and upgrades. Each choice shapes how you survive the next wave and how aggressively you can push back.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The Safe House</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Between runs, return to the Safe House to prepare for the next attempt. Choose your loadout, unlock new gear, and decide how you want to face the swarm.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Mutations</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Unlock Mutations, which can drastically alter how the game plays, forcing you to adapt your movement, strategy, and weapon use on the fly. No two runs feel the same for long.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Wishlist</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Wishlist now to be notified of updates, test events, and the May 12 launch.</p>",
