It was designed for non-VR gameplay and thus a VR headset is in no way required to play the game. If you do have one, it is an awesome (but different) experience!<br><br>VR is work in progress - Currently not implemented: VR Loading screens and Oculus Touch. The intro tutorial is also a bit rough. Everything else works solidly. TSP received a major VR patch July 20 2016 adding VR inventory and crafting among many other fixes, and another one on December 4 2016 adding the Explorer Diary and a range of fixes.</i><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/313630/extras/2dc8d069a68b7753def5230c959d1444.webp?t=1480876448\" width=610 height=61 /></span><br><br><strong>ABOUT US</strong><br><br>The Solus Project is the brainchild of Sjoerd &quot;Hourences&quot; De Jong.
