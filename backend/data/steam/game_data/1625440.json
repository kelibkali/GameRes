The gameplay is easy to learn but hard to master, making it accessible to players of all skill levels. However, as you progress through the game, you'll face increasingly difficult challenges that will test your skills to the limit.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>High Risk Launches:</strong> Once you launch yourself in any direction, there is no turning back. Launches can only be performed once you land somewhere and stay still.<br></li><li><strong>Intense Wall Jumps:</strong> Wall jumps help you access platforms that are much higher and farther, but also present the risk of losing control. A single horrible wall jump could mean falling back to the beginning.<br></li><li><strong>Hair Raising Slam Jumps:</strong> Once in the air, you can slam your character onto any surface in order to gain more height, but only once! These jumps can either help you avoid falling, or send you back to the very beginning.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625440/extras/4156e773022e97a2e5528daa7af7844e.poster.avif?t=1681823832\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625440/extras/4156e773022e97a2e5528daa7af7844e.webm?t=1681823832\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625440/extras/4156e773022e97a2e5528daa7af7844e.mp4?t=1681823832\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Every launch, wall jump, and slam jump counts like your life depends on it, as one mistake can send you falling back to the start of the level.

The danger zone moves to the location of the last landing spot, and as the player remains in the danger zone, the timer will count down and eventually reach 0, which will teleport the player to the beginning of Level 1.<br></li><li><strong>GigaByte Mode:</strong> This mode adds onto MB Mode and makes the game more challenging as the player will lose all progress if the timer reaches 0, meaning all your save data is gone.<br></li><li><strong>TeraByte Mode:</strong> This is the hardest game mode. In addition to what is in GB Mode, this mode gives the player less time to move out of the danger zone. The danger zone can also randomly turn from red to purple, which will invert the player's launch controls and makes things even more challenging.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625440/extras/cb4274e04ab0affbe380f208756d4cf2.poster.avif?t=1681823832\" width=600 height=200 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625440/extras/cb4274e04ab0affbe380f208756d4cf2.webm?t=1681823832\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625440/extras/cb4274e04ab0affbe380f208756d4cf2.mp4?t=1681823832\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Cross-Platform Leaderboards</h2><br>Compete against other players from around the world on the cross-platform leaderboards.
