    "description": "Robospierre is a short puzzle journey that offers 40 levels of the most varied puzzles for the player to challenge himself, while also exploring the past of the robot and his bird in a sensible and involving story!<br><br>The player will encounter sokobans with the best aspects from the genre. In this experience, you control a robot that must push his bird's cage through challenging puzzles until an exit point, cleaning the path of boxes and other obstacles and wisely thinking of how to use them in his favor. The game presents a twist in relation to the classical games of the genre in a way that certain tiles of the map, when activated, make the boxes return in the direction of their original positions, removing part of the control from the player and implying on a more careful choice of actions. Furthermore, additional mechanics are presented which subvert or dialog with the preexisting ones, keeping the game experience instigating and also demanding from the player new ways of thinking the solutions through the challenges.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" > Main characteristics </h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 40 challenging puzzles <br></li><li> A story filled gameplay<br></li><li> Hand drawn graphics and animations<br></li><li> Sensible soundtrack<br></li><li> Level Selector mode unlocked after the end of the campaign </li></ul>",
