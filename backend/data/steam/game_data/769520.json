You can start a solo game, but it's better to play it multiplayer (games from 2 to 5 players - best being 4).<br>Thanks to the Friend Pass, you can invite your friends to play with you for free!<br>We organize two times a month public plays, in English and in French<br><br><strong>* Can I play the game solo?</strong><br>Yes, you can start a solo game (with the Full Version), and take your time to familiarize yourself with the game. But you'll enjoy it more by playing with friends!<br>Friend Pass cannot start a solo game.<br><br><strong>* Can I invite my friends to play with me for free?</strong><br>Yes! When you buy the full version, you can host a game; your friends can download the Friend Pass and join your game.<br>Hosting the game allows you to set up all parameters - map, submarine type, difficulty, etc<br><br><strong>* What if we are 2 or 3 players only?</strong><br>A full crew is made of 4 sailors. You can nevertheless play with less players by letting AI manage Engineer, Sonar and/or Gunner stations. Only Pilot cannot be controled by AI.<br>If your are 5 players, one player can become Abyss Master.<br><br><strong>* What is the Abyss Master?</strong><br>Abyss Master is an optional role, and quite unique to the game. It allows one player to control the environment: add or remove enemies and objects, such as mines, oxygen bottles, pirate ships, whales, boss etc. He can control them (movement, attack, etc). He is a sort of Dungeon Master of role playing games!<br>Note that only host can become Abyss Master.<br><br><strong>* What are the monthly expeditions?</strong><br>Two times a month, we organize public plays. If you are alone or an incomplete crew, you are welcome to come and have fun with other sailors! Besides, the game is managed by an experienced Abyss Master who will make the game truly enjoyable.<br>To be informed of the next public play, subscribe to our newsletter or come to our Discord.<br><br><strong>* I am a streamer.
