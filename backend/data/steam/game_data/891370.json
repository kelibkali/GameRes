Your abilities, which are represented by your deck, determine what actions you can take in battle. As your journey continues you will grow in strength by finding new and more powerful equipment to enhance those abilities or provide other unique bonuses. Finally, through training, you will become stronger, smarter, faster and overall more effective with every action taken not only in combat, but throughout your adventure. Universally adaptable, the way you build your character along with the cards you select gives full customization allowing for mid-game changes to your build and style.<br><br><strong>What choices will you make to achieve your goals?</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Never be caught unprepared!
