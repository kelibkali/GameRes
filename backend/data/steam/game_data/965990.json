Their experiences while under your command will shape their development and affect their performance. As you get to know your squad on and off the battlefield you will explore the full depth of the human condition. Empathy will be your most powerful tool.<br><br><strong><i>We’ve all played the hero.

For example, if a character suffered trauma in their past they might need more reassurance and support. If they’ve taken multiple losses on the battlefield and are feeling down about themselves you’ll need to help them build up their confidence before they go back into more difficult missions. <br><br>The Insight Engine is built on extensive psychological modeling and in collaboration with consultation from real-life war veterans, it allows us to highlight the long-term costs of combat.<br><br><strong><u>Narrative by New York Times Bestselling Author, M.
