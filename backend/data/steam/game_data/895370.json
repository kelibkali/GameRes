    "description": "DollKart is a survival race against time. There is an infinite number of procedurally generated tracks to conquer both alone and with a friend in split screen.<br><br><strong>Handling</strong><br>The physics engine is roughly a simcade, mirroring real go karts but adding a lot more speed to them(because if you aren't almost dead, you're not having fun). The game is enjoyable without being a good driver, however, if you want to do good, you'll have to drive skillfully.<br><br><strong>Single Player</strong><br>In single player, your goal is to score as many points as possible by driving quickly through the tracks. Game's over when you fall off the track, your ragdoll character falls off the kart or when you run out of time(or all of these at once, if you're really bad).<br><br><strong>Split Screen</strong><br>In the split screen mode, your goal is to outrun one another on the same difficult tracks as before, dying or falling off the track means losing instantly.<br><br><strong>Online</strong><br>DUE TO UNFORESEEN TECHNICAL ISSUES, THE ONLINE MULTIPLAYER FOR DOLLKART IS BROKEN. We are unable to fix this due to the sourcecode of the game being now unrecoverable. We appreciate your understanding.<br><br><strong>Soundtrack</strong><br>We have a soundtrack of 8 songs ranging from relaxed synthwave to gritty metal for you to do your driving with, the songs are played in random order and can be skipped or muted in game.",
