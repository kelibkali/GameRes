    "description": "What do you want out of life? To be happy? Well that's just boring!<br>Do you think good things are better than bad things? You’re wrong again!<br>In Gloom, the more miserable you are the better things are going for you, and the very worst thing you can do for your friends is to bring them joy.<br><br>Each player controls the fate of an eccentric family of misfits. Your goal is sad, but simple: make your family suffer the greatest tragedies possible before allowing them to pass on to the well-deserved respite of death.<br>Ask penguins to poison them, make them starve in a storm or get written out of the will… The more miserable they are, the better!<br>That’s not all, if you want to win, you’ll have to make your rival’s family as happy and annoyingly alive as you can: delighted by ducklings, having picnics in the park, finding love at the lake… These are some of the worst things that could happen to them!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >HOW TO MAKE EVERYONE SUFFER?</h2>From 1 to 4 players. Each player gets two moves per turn.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tPlay modifier cards on top of character cards, describing the horrible mishaps you inflict on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer up your opponents’ characters with happy occasions that pile on positive points.<br></li><li>\tEvent cards will give you other chances to alter fates: draw cards on stormy nights, give a character a second chance in life or mess with another one by discarding its top modifier card… What a twist of fate!<br></li><li>\tFinally, kill your family or your rival’s family by using the Untimely Death cards! Baked into a pie, eaten by bears or just dying old and alone… There are so many ways to die.</li></ul><br><br>When the last character in any family dies, the game ends. The player with the lowest Family Value wins the game! <br>Who will be devoured by weasels and who will be wondrously well wed? Find out in Gloom…",
