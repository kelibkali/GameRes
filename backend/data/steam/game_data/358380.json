    "description": "Play as eight wacky animals in Wacky Wheels. Each animal has its own colorful antics and animations, including a tiger, elephant, raccoon, panda, shark, and more. These animals are incredibly competitive - they hate to lose! They take great joy in bumping, scraping and knocking you off the track. They want you at the back of the pack! <br><br>Nothing beats the competitive feel of racing. Feel the thrill as you race past your opponent, slam their car into a water trap, and beat them by a bumper to the finish line. Avoid obstacles, knock opponents, launch weapons, take shortcuts, engage turbo mode, and hit jumps with perfect timing to outrace your opponent every time!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Features</h2><br><strong>Three Dimensions of Dangerous</strong>: High-speed 3D point-of-view racing!<br><br><strong>Pig Out</strong>: Large variety of race tracks (42 total in the &quot;Upgrade Edition&quot;)<br><br><strong>Dog Eat Dog</strong>: Two-player, head-to-head modes via modem connection, serial link or on the same computer.<br><br><strong>Rat Race</strong>: 60 high score charts - one for each race type.<br><br><strong>Lion's Share</strong>: Race it out in time trials, standard races, battle zones, and the just-for-fun duck shoot-outs!<br><br><strong>Controller Support</strong>: Partial Xbox 360 Controller support.",
