Choose a uniquely powerful ability that promotes offensive or defensive play-styles as you battle your way through four distinct Deathpits and slaughter hoards of deadly enemies to earn Spacebux and unlock weapons, equipment and upgrades, all in a humorous dystopian sci-fi universe.<br><br>Originally inspired by retro classic Smash TV, and influenced by modern co-op titles such as Left 4 Dead, Alien Swarm, and Dawn of War II: The Last Stand, it’s a punchy experience - great for casual gamers but with enough challenge and tactical depth for hours of replayability.<br><br>The game now supports up to FOUR PLAYERS in ONLINE CO-OP. It can also be played SINGLE PLAYER, or with up to FOUR PLAYERS over LOCAL AREA NETWORK, which works even without internet.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/718720/extras/d9c0c3c485677aa618056a3fe252ab7f.webp?t=1667019685\" width=600 height=34 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>1-4 player co-op, online and over local area network<br></li><li>4 championships<br></li><li>4 powerful abilities (shield, teleport, lighting attack and invisibility)<br></li><li>5 voiced playable characters<br></li><li>6 tactically distinct, upgradable weapons<br></li><li>Grenades, mines, jetpacks, armour, deployable walls and turrets<br></li><li>13 enemy types, each with unique attacks and weaknesses<br></li><li>Complete wiki of humorous sci-fi universe and backstories<br></li><li>Steam Achievements &amp; Cloud Save<br></li><li>Full Xbox gamepad support and Steam controller configuration, for PC, Mac and Linux<br><br>In development and coming soon:<br></li><li>Trading cards (pending Steam authorization)</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/718720/extras/c54095cdeb52949ba4d5e6876233e96b.webp?t=1667019685\" width=600 height=34 /></span><br><br>DEATHPIT 3000 is the debut release by Cyberlamb Studios, a two-man indie developer from Wales, UK.",
