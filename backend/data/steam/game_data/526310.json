My current goal is to release Silhouette: Chapter One in early 2024, however, there's a good chance I will miss hitting this release date. Ultimately it will release when it's done.<br><br>Silhouette is currently a side project for me, meaning that I work on it when I need a break from my main project.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >&quot;It's like an old-school Point and Click Adventure game in a First Person perspective&quot;.</h2><br>Initially, Silhouette will <strong><u>only be available in English</u></strong>. Currently, the game will only run on windows, though I would like to create a Mac and Linux port in the future.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/526310/extras/4ae1d3a6c597bc9aef26b29092802019.poster.avif?t=1691787325\" width=504 height=126 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/526310/extras/4ae1d3a6c597bc9aef26b29092802019.webm?t=1691787325\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/526310/extras/4ae1d3a6c597bc9aef26b29092802019.mp4?t=1691787325\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
