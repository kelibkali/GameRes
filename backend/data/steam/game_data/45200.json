    "description": "The award-winning cult classic has emerged from its tomb! <br><br>One part <i>Minesweeper</i>, one part <i>Civilization</i>.  With every click of the mouse your empire grows stronger. Spend your turns wisely, and when the barbarians come you will conquer them and re-unite your kingdom. Will your empire stand the test of time? Claim your destiny and unlock the power that lies at the heart of Oasis.<br><br><i>Defense of the Oasis</i> is a fast turn-based exploration strategy game. Each level gives you 85 turns to explore, discover cities, build roads, research technology and build as strong a kingdom as you can. When your turns are up, the barbarian hordes attack! If your cities survive the assault, you capture the kingdom's Glyph of Power—<i>if you found while exploring</i>. Capture twelve Glyphs of Power from twelve different levels to win the game. Lose too many battles against the barbarians, and you will lose the game. <br><br><i>Defense of the Oasis</i> features four different difficulty levels (<i>Easy</i>, <i>Normal</i>, <i>Hard</i> and <i>Insane</i>) as well as nine different multi-level campaign scenarios. All the levels in the game are procedurally generated, for infinite replayability.",
