Please contact us through Twitter, our website or the forums if you encounter something wrong with the game, something misleading on the store page, or you just want to say hello.<br><br>Thank you for taking a moment to read this; we really hope you enjoy playing our games.<br><i>Antti &amp; Ville - Parta Games</i><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/554330/extras/42bb58b0cfb8c4c2e1c5ce4217b29682.webp?t=1759401130\" width=300 height=52 /></span><br><br>You are Rick Guiver, a reckless coast guard rescue helicopter pilot.
