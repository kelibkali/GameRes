    "description": "Welcome to the Paperville demo, Rookie! This demo is coming Late October so you can get a small taste of the world of Paperville and its dangers. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the fire departments newest recruit, you're in for a sweet ride at your new employment. Cheque cashing, boot sorting, lunch stealing - after all, in a town made of arts and crafts, how often would there ever be a fire?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPaperville is proof that anyone has what it takes to be a hero, as long as safety and saving lives aren’t priorities. A tongue-in-cheek look into the world of firefighting, in a town filled with strange critters, odd personalities and secrets to discover.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGuided by a less-than-stellar fire department, you must help restore Paperville to it’s former papery glory. From clearing building fires, rescuing citizens from rubble, hacking through doors, to dealing with townsfolk and their personal issues, Rookie does it all. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnly you can be the one to save Paperville. <br />\r\nWell, someone else probably could, but you’re all they’ve got.",
