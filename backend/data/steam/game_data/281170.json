As you struggle to find a way back home, you uncover an increasingly malevolent and time-twisted plot to devour the ancient creatures of Terra. You must confront this corrupted power to save Terra and ultimately, yourself.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Complex Role Playing</strong> – Explore a vast RPG where the decisions you make change the world around you. Will you gather and trade the Ancient Elven Relics for a Dorian ship, or trek through the uncharted depths of the Woods of Despair? By virtue of the choices available in Last Dream, there are over five hundred unique paths in your journey through the mystical land of Terra.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Tremendous Replayability</strong> – Last Dream allows the freedom to choose any 4-character party you wish from 8 distinctive character classes. With over 4,000 party variations, you’ll never run out of new experiences.
