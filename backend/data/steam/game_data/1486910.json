    "description": "This is the perfect representation of a console gaming experience. Just sit on a couch, play an interactive movie in cinematic 30 fps 720p and press X to Win over your enemies. <br>Don't have money to buy a console but have a dollar to buy a game? Look no further, the experience this game gives is indistinguishable from the real one.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1486910/extras/0362d5baa839ed4d7740d4c0d371e525.poster.avif?t=1608757055\" width=544 height=240 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1486910/extras/0362d5baa839ed4d7740d4c0d371e525.webm?t=1608757055\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1486910/extras/0362d5baa839ed4d7740d4c0d371e525.mp4?t=1608757055\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>Features:<br><br>⚪Play in cinematic 30 fps @ 720p. <br>⚪Play an interactive movie<br>⚪Press X to Win<br>⚪Next gen console graphics <br>⚪Play a corridor shooter. Shoot waves of zombies to see <strong><i>deep plot cut-scenes</i></strong> and then repeat the loop till you hit the 20 hours mark. Oh, and you also can hunt for loot in side quests, so the game is actually 150 + hours long if complete all of the objectives. So we could sell the game for $99.99 actually but yeah, we are just too kind and sell it for $0.99. <br>⚪First person view<br>⚪Immersive gameplay<br>⚪Play a game inside a game<br>⚪Gamepad support<br>⚪Achievements<br>⚪3d graphics<br>⚪Satire",
