But these days sodbusters who walk that path don't come back. They just get swallowed up by the shadows.</i><br><strong>...AND NOW I GOT THE FEAR!</strong><br>Send your Heroic posse into a town on the verge of oblivion, where they encounter vibrant personalities, stiff challenges, and weird terrors galore. Trouble is, they also find the world's oldest &quot;living&quot; Harrowed...as well as the Deathly Drifter himself! Can they defeat the evils of Dante's Ferry...and tell enough rousing tales to save its beleaguered folks?<br>A Tale of Two Killers requires the Savage Worlds core rules, the Deadlands Player's Guide, and the Deadlands Marshal's Handbook to play.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Scott Geeding</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
