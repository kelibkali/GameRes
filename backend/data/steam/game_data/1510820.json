    "description": "<strong>Briddle</strong> is an indie game where you have 25 riddles to solve, you can do this alone or with some friends. In each level you will receive some hints that can be found either in images, texts or codes. You won’t receive any additional help, you are completely by yourself. <br>You should search for info on internet, that will help you a lot, trust me. This game might require some software and a little bit of basic knowledge on image editing, as well as tons of patience and a lot of dedication.<br>With that being said, I hope you can reach level 25, and for that I wish you the best of luck, but most importantly have fun 😊<br>TRC",
