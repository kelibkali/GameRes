Or you can go with total random shots.<br><br><strong>Challenge yourself with drills. </strong> There are a selection of drills that challenge you to improve positioning and make more saves.<br><br><strong>Face a realistic shooter.</strong> All shots you face are created with animations from real shooters.<br><br><strong>See puck perspective replays.</strong> After a shot, you can watch the replay from the puck's perspective. This is great for seeing your positioning and what holes were there.<br><br><strong>Customize your settings.</strong> You can adjust where the shooter is and if they should move. Both normal and righty modes are supported.<br><br>With TendyTrainer, you'll never be limited by ice time.",
