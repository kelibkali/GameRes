    "description": "Magic Mouse is an action-adventure top-down dungeon crawl set in a fantasy world where the player makes their way to fight dangerous enemies, overcome powerful bosses and survive perilous traps all while honing magical powers and gaining money to progress in stats and unique new powers in the five elements. This game is similar to the game Enter the Gungeon. This is due to the level layout of the game. Like to Enter the Gungeon, Magic Mouse will have the player go through room after room to kill all the enemies and acquire loot. The main difference between Enter the Gungeon and Magic Mouse is the compact mechanics. In Enter the Gungeon the player uses guns, while in Magic Mouse the player uses their mouse to cast spells.",
