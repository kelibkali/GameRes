    "description": "Crystal Flux is a rhythm snowboarding shooter that rewards player for picking up orbs in sync with the music. The 12 track original score was written alongside development to blend art style and drive gameplay. Levels are designed by hand with procedural obstacles to provide a unique experience each time. The game uses creative physical forces to say exciting while allowing players to anticipate momentum. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are 4 environments that require different gear to achieve maximum points. New boards and armor can be purchased by orbs found in previous levels.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nLeaderboards will include seeded values for each level so players can compete on identical maps if they choose.",
