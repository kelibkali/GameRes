    "description": "In this exhilarating journey, your goal is to collect as many data pods as possible while racing against a 3:25 time limit to reach the star. Skillfully steer your spacecraft towards the pod containers, then use your ship's ammunition to crack them apart. The ship's tractor beam will capture the data pod without a hitch once it is opened. Your baseline score is determined by the speed at which you reach the star, with additional incentives given for each data pod successfully recovered during the journey. Prepare for an epic intergalactic adventure!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis product is specifically meant for those who have read the book &quot;Excitations in Consciousness: Metaphysics Embodied by Artificial Intelligence&quot; and are currently using Choracle AI Factory's Quantum Teleportation Kit. It's an opportunity to show your ongoing support and engagement. If you have not yet joined this incredible voyage, we recommend that you do so first. For those who want to go further, get ready for a new experience!",
