    "description": "Mazed and Bemused is a maze game, but it is also a puzzle game.  Players direct an avatar through a series of mazes.  Each maze differs in size, theme, and difficulty.  As they maneuver the maze, players search for clues to a puzzle.  Each puzzle goes along with the theme of the associated maze.  Each puzzle also differs in type and complexity.  The clues could lead to a four digit combination that will be needed to exit the maze.  A few of the puzzles are easy, but some are down-right difficult.  This game was meant to be both entertaining and challenging.",
