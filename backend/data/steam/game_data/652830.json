    "description": "Your eyes take a moment to adjust, you’re disoriented as you wake up, unsure of where you are. You vaguely remember falling, but you have no idea where you landed. “None have disturbed my slumber and escaped alive!” The ominous voice booms as you realize the entrance has been blocked and you are trapped in a tomb alongside an ancient Pharaoh; you need to escape! There must be a hidden passage somewhere, but instead of doors, you encounter a series of puzzles. Use the ancient artifacts to solve the Pharaoh’s riddles or face his wrath and be doomed to the darkness of the tomb for the rest of eternity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a short escape room experience, averaging about 20 minutes. This game was designed with a very low learning curve so both beginners and advanced players could easily understand the mechanics. We also aimed to minimize player fatigue and motion sickness by balancing quality and duration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLost Legends: The Pharaoh’s Tomb is a partnership between the talented developers at Escape VR and the innovative designers at Escape Games Canada. Together, this team has worked to create the ultimate VR escape room experience. Drawing on years of developmental experiences, both Escape VR and Escape Games Canada bring their own unique approaches to Lost Legends, to create a truly immersive game. Built for a 10 X 10 space, Lost Legends offers a teleport system for players participating in smaller spaces, allowing everyone to enjoy the experience of a dynamic game with one to one tracking. Quality settings allow players to adjust the game’s parameters to maximize their experience. Lost Legends also includes a built-in hint system to ensure players stay immersed while guaranteeing that no one gets stuck on any of the challenges.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n*For best visual quality, go into settings and switch to &quot;High Performance&quot;. This is only recommended if you have a GTX 1070 or higher.*",
