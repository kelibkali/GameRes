    "description": "&quot;Tiny Brains&quot; is a cooperative action puzzler that follows four super-powered lab animals in their attempt to escape a mad scientist's experiments.  In this joyously chaotic multiplayer game, the four &quot;Tiny Brains&quot; must combine their unique physics-based powers to navigate through a trick-ridden maze.                                                                             All of the puzzles in &quot;Tiny Brains&quot; can be solved multiple ways depending on how groups combine their powers.                                                                                                            The game has competitive and challenging fast paced communicative play along with simple controls so players of any level can jump right in.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >KEY GAMEPLAY FEATURES</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Cooperative Gaming:</strong> Tiny Brains requires players to collaborate and put their heads together to overcome physics-based obstacles. With each player controlling a different superpower – Create, Force, Vortex and Teleport – the Tiny Brains must work as a team to move forward and escape the scientist’s deadly labyrinth of mazes.<br><br></li><li><strong>Play It Your Way:</strong> All of the puzzles in Tiny Brains can be solved multiple ways depending on how groups combine their powers. The co-op level design creates dynamic, emergent gameplay, whether advancing through the campaign mode, beating time-based challenges, or competing in endless levels.<br><br></li><li><strong>Whimsical World:</strong> To escape the mad scientist’s lair, players explore a colorful world of Popsicle stick-like ice pops, duct tape, tiny cages and Rube Goldberg machines. The zany art style gives rise to a slew of slightly mutated, yet oddly cute, playable characters.<br><br></li><li><strong>Hardcore to Casual:</strong> Tiny Brains eggs on hardcore gamers with competitive leaderboards and fast-paced communicative play, challenging them to combine their powers as efficiently as possible. At the same time, the game has simple controls and physics-based mechanics that make it easy for casual and less-experienced gamers to jump right in.</li></ul>",
