This is akin to a typical <strong>TV sitcom</strong> in the sense that each episode focuses on a certain situation or scenario that has a beginning, middle and end as opposed to a larger, overarching narrative found in serialized television. <br><br>All nine of these episodes are selectable from the main menu at the get go and aim to reinforce the idea of daily life mundanity but with a <strong>comedic</strong> twist as you come across the inhabitants of this<strong> very strange</strong> city and get up to various <strong>shenanigans</strong>. <br><br>Get to know a <strong>wide cast of colourful personalities</strong> in this short, whimsical, light-hearted and fun slice-of-life comedy.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1147390/extras/4a7b2a45db9d964fc951286945cb36d0.avif?t=1612529046\" width=585 height=117 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Pixel Art style<br></li><li>Linear, scenario-based structure with nine different episodes<br></li><li>Fun cast of characters<br></li><li>Pick up and play at your own pace! <br></li><li>Free!!</li></ul>",
