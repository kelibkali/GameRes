    "description": "The Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE) is a tool used by many Skyrim mods that expands scripting capabilities and adds additional functionality to the game. This is the same version that is hosted on our main website, but should be the most user-friendly to install and update.<br><br>Once installed, no additional steps are needed to launch Skyrim with SKSE's added functionality. The Steam in-game overlay must be enabled for this integration to work. If you prefer running without the overlay, start Skyrim by launching skse_loader.<br><br>If you use multiple Steam libraries, please make sure to install SKSE to the same library that you have chosen for Skyrim.<br><br>By default, this installation will automatically update to the latest version of SKSE when released. If you prefer to stay on an older version, they will be available via the &quot;betas&quot; tab, allowing you to pick an older build.<br><br>The current version of SKSE is 1.7.3.",
