    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >THE FINAL CHAPTER IN TOAPLAN'S SHMUP SAGA</h2><br>Set out on a breathtaking journey with Batsugun, Toaplan's shoot-'em-up swansong! Choose your hero from a roster of six charismatic pilots and three distinctive ship types, each brimming with personality. Immerse yourself in a world of dazzling graphics, devastating firepower, and an enchanting soundtrack, creating a sensory experience you won't soon forget. The accessible gameplay ensures that seasoned veterans and newcomers alike can revel in the unmatched thrill of victory!<br><br>In addition, the rebalanced Batsugun Special is also included, and features a visual overhaul with new colors and altered enemy behavior. A smaller hitbox and a shield protecting the ship from one hit, makes it easier which is needed as the barrage of enemy projectiles ups the ante for the true bullet hell factor. Batsugun Special introduces multiple loops, increasing difficulty with each completion. Can you master all four loops?<br><br>&quot;As we prepare to launch with the Skull Hornets, our mission stands clear: overthrow the oppressive regime of King Renoselva A. Gladebaran VII. The path ahead is fraught with adrenaline-pumping battles and perilous missions. Our comrades and I are eager, but the question lingers: can we restore liberty to our people and emerge victorious?&quot;<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2023000/extras/d4236214a73029dd02a043a3e8c81367.poster.avif?t=1771485008\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2023000/extras/d4236214a73029dd02a043a3e8c81367.webm?t=1771485008\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2023000/extras/d4236214a73029dd02a043a3e8c81367.mp4?t=1771485008\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >ORIGINAL GAME FEATURES:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Embark on an enthralling sci-fi adventure where every encounter feels like a mini-boss battle at minimum, demanding your utmost vigilance to survive.<br></li><li>Unleash mighty weapons like the Sky Mirage, Dragon's Whisper, and Judgement Flash to eradicate enemy threats.<br></li><li>Boost your firepower with experience points from defeated enemies.<br></li><li>Immerse yourself in the captivating space melodies of Yoshitatsu Sakai.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2023000/extras/01be38fa5de7e5d691725d77baf99259.poster.avif?t=1771485008\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2023000/extras/01be38fa5de7e5d691725d77baf99259.webm?t=1771485008\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2023000/extras/01be38fa5de7e5d691725d77baf99259.mp4?t=1771485008\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Minimal Input Lag: Emulation, input processing, and rendering all complete on the same frame.<br></li><li>Quick Save using F1-F10, Reload with Shift+ F1-F10<br></li><li>Online leaderboards for Single Credit, No Assist, and Assisted plays.<br></li><li>Instrument panels with extra gameplay information and artwork.<br></li><li>Rewind the game between 10-18 minutes, depending on the action.<br></li><li>Capture sharable replays to immortalize your interstellar victories (or funny moments).<br></li><li>Assist Features such as auto-fire at multiple rates.<br></li><li>Very Easy Mode: Lower the difficulty to breeze through the adventure.<br></li><li>Pixel perfect or full-screen scaling in windowed or full-screen mode.<br></li><li>Rotate the gameplay in 90-degree increments. <br></li><li>Steam Achievements<br></li><li>Choose between Raw Input on Windows or Steam Input.<br></li><li>Hone your skills in the ultra customizable practice mode!</li></ul>",
