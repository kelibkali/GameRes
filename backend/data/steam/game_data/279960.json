    "description": "<strong>May 10th, 1940</strong><br>The Maginot Line, shield of France and the battleship on land, was supposed to be impenetrable, but the Germans have a secret and daring plan aimed to topple their old enemy! Import your experienced troops from the first campaign, or start with a pre-generated brand new core and lead your forces to victory. This DLC features 14 all new scenarios, recreating historical battles such as the epic of Eben-Emael and the tank battles of Arras and Stonne, improved artificial intelligence scripting, new campaign features, unique objectives such as capturing a French General and forcing the Dunkirk pocket to surrender, and the capacity to save your core force for use in future campaigns!<br><br>The Grand Campaign’s are a series of expansions for Panzer Corps. Each campaign can be started with the core force from the previous Grand Campaign, so you can continue Grand Campaign ’40 with your core force that completed Grand Campaign ’39. Alternatively players can start with a preset core force and play each campaign on its own, or jump in to the Grand Campaign at any year.<br><br><strong>Scenario List</strong><br>Eben-Emael<br> Albert Canal<br> The Hague<br> Sedan<br> Maubeuge<br> Arras<br> Calais<br> Stonne<br> Wassigny<br> Amiens<br> Dunkirk<br> Reims<br> Dijon<br> Maginot Line",
