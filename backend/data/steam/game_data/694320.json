    "description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>UnderRail 2: Infusion</strong> is an immersive isometric turn-based RPG set in distant future, when the life on the Earth’s surface has long since been made impossible and the remnants of humanity now dwell in the Underrail, a vast system of metro station-states that, it seems, are the last bastions of a fading race.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >You are a <i>scavenger</i>. Wandering through the ruins of a fallen civilization, scavengers make their living scouring Underrail for technology and resources. This is a hazardous profession, often taking its practitioners to dangerous places, such as the hidden city of Solidon - the place you find yourself at the start of the game.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >COMBAT</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/694320/extras/a82d260700ff25e2b0dcd90e8c33cf3e.poster.avif?t=1761864158\" width=450 height=256 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/694320/extras/a82d260700ff25e2b0dcd90e8c33cf3e.webm?t=1761864158\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/694320/extras/a82d260700ff25e2b0dcd90e8c33cf3e.mp4?t=1761864158\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Combat is turn-based, but atomic, allowing the player and the NPCs to take turns performing short actions like in traditional roguelike games. This allows for more reactivity.
