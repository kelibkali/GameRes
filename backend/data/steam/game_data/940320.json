    "description": "Combo Jumper is a first person platformer. The core mechanic of the game is combo points. You gain a combo point every time you wall jump, your collected combo points multiply your launch velocity, giving you the ability to leap further. Missing your mark on a jump and falling to the ground resets your combo points and brings you to the start of the level. Combo Jumper includes 8 diverse levels that get progressively harder so don’t underestimate the amount of playtime you'll get because of the steep difficulty curve.",
