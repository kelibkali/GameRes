    "description": "Rage Quest is a challenging, 4-hour, tile-based, real-time, combat-focused RPG.<br><br>You play as Zye, a man who has awoken in the internet and has no idea how he got there. Shortly after dispatching a YouTube comment (the game’s first enemy), he learns that the only way he’s going to escape the internet and return to the real world is to amass enough energy to create a portal. However, the only energy source prevalent enough on the internet to fuel this escape is… <strong>hate</strong>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A new kind of RPG combat system</h2><br>Rage Quest is a real-time, tile-based, combat RPG where you you have to carefully time and chain your actions for maximum effectiveness.<br><br>Every action has a charge time (the time until the action executes) and a cooldown time (the time until the action can be used again). The player must think both quickly and strategically to be effective in combat. It's not just about using the right actions together, but timing the execution of them as well.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Worlds you've known your whole life, like you've never seen before</h2><br>Zye will journey through the worlds of social media, online gaming, and corporate influence on his quest to amass hate. On his journey he'll encounter enemies such as  The Hive Mind, Gamergate, The Twitch Chat, trolls, flamers, hackers, bloatware, malware, spambots, user data, censorship, fake news and many more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Learn any ability, buy any item, right from the start</h2><br>Rage Quest is an RPG where every ability and item purchase is unlocked from the start. Most games avoid this because it can be tough to balance, but the payoff is free-form and creative game play. Besides, if you're able to break the game by being super clever, then you've earned it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >A battle system built for both keyboard/mouse and touchscreens.</h2><br>Whether you're playing on a desktop, laptop, or a touchscreen computer, Rage Quest's battle system takes advantage of your ability to quickly pinpoint a location on your screen.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >And of course, the things that make an RPG, an RPG.</h2><br>4 worlds (each about an hour long), branching paths, sides quests, NPCs, loot, bosses, character growth, and all that good stuff an RPG should have.",
