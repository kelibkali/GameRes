If neither the protagonist nor Grendel want to become another casualty, a way out of their predicament is needed. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Will the protagonist and Grendel be able to solve the mystery? Are the murders caused by invisible aliens called the '<i>Enemies Of Civilisation</i>' or something more mundane?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong><u>The Council of the Unseen</u></strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Founded by Abigail Herrera and Frederick Jinx as a means of exacting revenge for the suffering they endured throughout their lives, the Council of the Unseen is dedicated to achieving world domination. Its tools of influence include espionage, extortion, blackmail, sabotage, and propaganda. While the Council typically refrains from killing, it is fully prepared to do so if deemed necessary.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Council's main base is located somewhere in America, operating under the guise of a legitimate corporation, Mr. Nibbles Fortune Holdings. They maintain listening stations and satellite bases around the globe, gathering information to manipulate people, corporations, nations, and even presidents at will.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >However, much to Abigail's frustration, other younger and more reckless organizations also aim to rule the world. Adding to her irritation, The Council's plans for domination are persistently thwarted by their nemesis: The Phoenix Custodians.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong><u>The Phoenix Custodians</u></strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The Phoenix Custodians were formed shortly after The Council's inception—or so its &quot;official history&quot; claims. According to this same account, their funding is provided by all the democratic nations of the world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The protagonist, an ex-computer programmer, was recruited by The Phoenix Custodians following a devastating terrorist attack on their home city. The protagonist’s ideals—favouring thoughtful problem-solving over &quot;shoot first, ask questions later&quot; tactics—were not universally popular within the organization. After completing their training, the protagonist was assigned a suicide mission targeting Grendel Jinx, the kleptomaniacal and megalomaniacal daughter of Abigail Herrera and Frederick Jinx.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Defying all expectations, the protagonist not only survived the encounter with Grendel but also saved her from a nearly fatal, self-inflicted explosion. This earned the protagonist Grendel's &quot;friendship&quot; (at great financial expense) and drew the attention of her parents, Abigail and Frederick.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >As a reward for a &quot;successful mission&quot;, the protagonist is put in charge of a department tasked with combating The Council and similar organizations—though their office is nothing more than a converted broom cupboard, and their employees are openly hostile.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1385500/extras/5f104b6467c0689cb5d8207659e502ee.webp?t=1760131454\" data-big-src=https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1385500/extras_big/5f104b6467c0689cb5d8207659e502ee.avif?t=1760131454 width=800 height=63 /></span></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Comedy/drama visual novel thriller, with scenes of graphic violence  </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > Game choices affect the ending as well as which secondary story path to follow, with three different endings and two epilogues </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > Anime style characters </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > Internal and Steam achievements </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > Around 102 CG screens in total </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" > 79,000+ word story, totalling 6 - 8 hours play.
