    "description": "<strong>Summary</strong><br>Dämmerlicht is a game based around the many worlds theory,<br>where the actions of the player create alternate universes and<br>allow you to experience each potential path the game world could take.<br><br><strong>About</strong><br>Dämmerlicht is mostly an adventure game. <br>The most important aspect of this game is that it is based on the many worlds theory<br>(an explanation of this theory follows).<br><br>The game is level based, meaning that you don't run around a big open world.<br>Instead you have a level select screen that represents the map of the game world,<br>and the various worlds that your choices create.<br><br>Each level takes place in a selected area (Your house, the village, a forest...) <br>and possesses many possible outcomes that are unlocked by doing different actions.<br><br>Short example:<br>You could join the king, unlocking a level which is the universe where our hero joins the king.<br>Then you could attempt this level again but instead kill the king, unlocking a new level which<br>is a completely different universe than the previous one since in this universe, the king is dead.<br><br>Not every single action in the game has a different outcome.<br>but the player has the option to attempt to unlock every possible outcome of this world.<br>Each path will be different and in each one of those, the player will experience different things:<br>pure combat, love story, research, treason, or even all at once!<br><br>Things to expect from the game:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Between 1 to 4 hours of gameplay(depending on how long it takes the player to find each endings)<br></li><li>19 playable levels that unlocks a total of 25 endings (some similar other completely different)<br></li><li>Diversified dialogues through a nice dialogue system<br></li><li>Interesting, simple combat system, and different enemy types.<br></li><li>No procedural generation--every single thing in the game is carefully placed<br></li><li>A story-rich game</li></ul><br>Things you won't get in this game:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>This is by no mean a roguelike or an rpg<br></li><li>No procedural generation<br></li><li>No crafting<br></li><li>No dungeon<br></li><li>...</li></ul><br><strong>Story</strong><br>Dämmerlicht takes place in a medieval fantasy inspired universe<br>where strangely everything is named after some sort of a tableware.<br><br>The Kingdom of the Small Cup is the smallest kingdom to be known in the Table World.<br>Even if the Small Cup is lacking the military force of the Butcher's Knife Kingdom, or the<br>economic power of the Silverware Kingdom, it lives fairly in peace providing well being to all its inhabitants.<br><br>Following strange phenomenon and a spontaneous event, the Table World saw itself changed.<br>This event started to cause frenzy among the inhabitants of this world,<br>as well as increase the relentless behavior of monsters who in<br>the past weren't aggressive unless provoked.<br><br>Consecutively, the tension started to rise all around the Table World.<br>Kingdoms started to suspect each other, while others tried<br>to solve this problem together. The royalty aren't the only affected, <br>however, as some people see their family and friends fall into insanity <br>and begin doubt the rulers above them.",
