    "description": "<strong>Oafmatch</strong> is a roleplaying game that combines traditional RPG turn-based combat with match-three mechanics.<br><br>Join Knuckles the Oaf and his menagerie of faithful companions in an epic quest to save their stricken homeland  from the vile depredations of a powerful and mysterious foe.

It is also a game for tinkerers, as beneath its friendly exterior lurks a very deep well of party-building and party-outfitting strategic gameplay.<br><br>The game's <strong>strategy</strong> and <strong>tactics</strong> revolve, you see, around six colors: red, yellow, green, white, blue, and purple. Each character is assigned two colors, a major and a minor one. A properly formed party will have all six colors represented; at least in minor form. Neglect a color at your own peril!<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/554220/extras/6616c8ac8f0629d0e328998be5534e7b.avif?t=1498338403\" width=620 height=165 /></span><br><br>Fail to carefully choose equipment at your own peril too! It is equipment that will allow your party to <strong>tactically flexible</strong> and <strong>resilient</strong>.<br>Equipment can be broken down into the following general categories, with some overlap:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Direct damage. These are items that mainly deal damage to one or several targets. An example is the Poleaxe, which damages the target and one random enemy standing next to it.<br></li><li>Board control. These are items that let the player control the flow of play on the 8x8 gem board. The Pipes of Beckoning, for example, allow the player to precisely choose a handful of gems to be destroyed.<br></li><li>Mana management. These items help the player gain mana, or hinder the enemy's mana generation. An example is the Mana Scalpel, which destroys a small amount from each of the enemy's mana pools.<br></li><li>Board shuffling: These are items that wreak havoc on the board in unpredictable ways, often generating  powerful cascading matches, and destroying precious enemy special gems in the process. And example is the Orb of Magma, which places a special persistent Magma Gem on the board. Each turn, this Magma Gem destroys the three gems immediately above it.</li></ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/554220/extras/fd2705803b387e1e0a00dd0f8f7de98a.avif?t=1498338403\" width=620 height=220 /></span>",
