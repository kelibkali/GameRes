Or am I the leading force behind all this, the one that could shake the core of this strange place?!<br><br>Wurroom is an immersive experience into a surreal utopia, disguised as a short exploration adventure game. The hero is a mouse cursor; an ordinary Hand, becoming aware of its power over the strange Imaginarium. <br><br>Wurroom is not just a game, it's an artistic collision between the minds of Michael Rifdshir and Serge Bulat; a metaphysical island created for the coexistence of ideas about art, nature, science, and Mind; all to question reality, and make a boundaryless new one. It is designed to reveal things about ourselves and measure our imagination.  <br><br>Everything you see in Wurroom is handmade; the claymated universe brought to live by stop-frame animation. <br>The music is the gluing force and the true master of this extraordinary world. Once you close your eyes, the world becomes you. <br><br>But beware of the truth... you don't play the game. The game plays you to learn about its very existence.",
