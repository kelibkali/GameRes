    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >     Sword Worlds</h2>The Sword Worlds lie just beyond the Imperial border, a distinct cultural region settled long ago by refugees from a civil war. Theirs was a tough existence, but it produced a people both proud and resilient. Their history is one of internal and external conflict; wars for dominance of the Sword Worlds and wars against the Imperium.<br>Sword Worlds details the people of the Sword Worlds Confederation as they have never been seen before. Their motivations, their strengths and their weaknesses - along with the truth behind Imperial stereotypes of reckless spacegoing chauvinists, and the darker side of their culture.<br>This book examines how the worlds of the Confederation interact with one another, and how a technologically outmatched people have managed to stave off Imperial dominance for so long. Their armed forces are technologically simple yet incredibly resilient; their navy is very different to that of the Imperium. Minelayers, torpedo boats and orbital defence platforms defend the home worlds whilst battlecruisers raid deep into enemy territory.<br>Sword Worlds reveals secrets and little-known facts about the Sword Worlds Confederation. The Gimli endeavour, which strives to preserve Sword Worlds culture against any and all disasters; the Holmgang Compact, by which scores are settled illegally with honour. The Sword Worlders' near-obsession with their tragic hero Admiral Denisov, and the Lost Swords - colonies that may still exist far beyond known space.<br>The Sword Worlds Confederation is a complex place, and at times a dangerous one. The Sword Worlders themselves are misunderstood by outsiders but one thing is clear - they are proud and quick to anger, slow to forgive. The Sword Worlds is a region where only the brave should venture, and where courage is the key to success or a noble death... or perhaps both.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Lee Paxton</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and a one time purchase of the Traveller 2E (Mongoose) ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
