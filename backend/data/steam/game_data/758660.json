    "description": "NeverBound is the gravity-shifting shooter that adds another dimension to the traditional FPS. Take part in mind-bending combat and puzzles in multi-gravity environments. You are as dangerous from below as you are from above. Scale the walls and ceilings, or use long hallways as vertical drops, as you outmaneuver your enemies.<br><br>NeverBound takes place in a future where a fifth fundamental force of nature has been discovered. The technology quickly revolutionizes society and allows humans to simulate arbitrary directions of gravity. A new architecture for a new age arises, STRUCT, in which the flows of populous are greatly improved due to its multi-gravity nature.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/758660/extras/0849f913d9bc46ef269ff4f4bcb11286.poster.avif?t=1595374496\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/758660/extras/0849f913d9bc46ef269ff4f4bcb11286.webm?t=1595374496\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/758660/extras/0849f913d9bc46ef269ff4f4bcb11286.mp4?t=1595374496\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The rules have changed.
