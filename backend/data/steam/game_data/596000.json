All you see is white around you. You hear a voice. You see a watch, swinging slowly in front of your eyes:<br><br>“I know you think everything is alright, but tell me, how come you can’t even remember her name?”<br><br>The Shattering places you in the mind of John Evans, where you struggle to piece together the fragments of your past and present. Not remembering is one thing, but what will happen when your mind leads you down the twisted path of fake memories in order to shelter you from the truth?<br><br>Follow the voice of the Doctor as it guides you deeper into your mind, and experience the key moments of John’s life that had defined and shaped him. Discover the truth, shatter the lies, find out what happened to John… and remember her name.<br><br>The Shattering is a first-person, story-driven, psychological thriller. Its defining features are the dynamic environments, beautiful aesthetics and intriguing story. There are no failure conditions in The Shattering, nor complicated puzzles. The gameplay is meant to submerge you in the mind of John, as you take each step forward into the twisted mystery of what had happened. A serene and emotionally charged soundtrack gives life to every single moment, while the visuals delight at every corner.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/596000/extras/7246f2181a056ec96ea34b6f00c840e6.avif?t=1726568225\" width=630 height=104 /></span><br><br>A rich and constantly evolving world taking place in the mind of John, where there are no limits or rules.<br><br>Beautiful and rich realistic environments painted with a pristine white aesthetic provide a original scenery that stands apart.<br><br>An intriguing story split into 4 acts that pieces together knowledge of the past and understanding of the present as you progress.<br><br>A sublime, gripping and intense original score composed for the story of The Shattering breathes live into each moment.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/596000/extras/99fede857eecb533bd86589832a4c7db.avif?t=1726568225\" width=630 height=104 /></span><br><br>The Shattering is a work of passion coming from a small group of 5 close friends lead by Marta Szymanska. Super Sexy Software started in spirit in 2013, when the first echoes of The Shattering started to take form. The project began from studying the contrast of white and black in horror and culture. The core theme draws on the premise that horrors and fear can be achieved through embracing white and the absence of information, rather than darkness and the obvious, though unseen, enemy.<br><br>Over various iterations, the game took shape and the decision was made to work on it in every spare moment that could be found. With members of the team residing in Poland, France and Switzerland, they grew in experience and efficiency as the true spirit of the studio was born. As the game progressed, the developers and Deck13 met at a networking event and the synergy between the companies resonated immediately. A publisher was found, and all the ingredients to finish The Shattering were ready.<br><br>With the full development spanning multiple years, births and deaths, tears and laughter, the only joy greater than that of the journey together as one team and family, is the joy of seeing The Shattering take shape and be played by people around the world. We’d like to thank you, the player, for taking interest in our passion. We hope our story can echo out and reach gamers around the world.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/596000/extras/950a817045e8252f50ff77461088e46f.avif?t=1726568225\" width=630 height=130 /></span>",
