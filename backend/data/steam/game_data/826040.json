It was a lot of work to make new things out of everything I developed. There were a lot of accidents during development, but I am very happy and proud to release this.<br><br>I hope you like it.<br><br>If you give us a lack of points or feedback while you play, we will actively try to develop it into a better game.<br>Thank you.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/826040/extras/f51780ccf857c910b1f0530c3c7b2180.avif?t=1614737110\" width=600 height=100 /></span><br>I have been impressed with Cave Story during my junior high school days and have developed the dream of game developers.<br>Can I make a game like this? <br>I used to ask myself the question of the rough and delicate Cave Story graphics. That's why you may feel the same atmosphere in my game.<br>If you compare Sacred Stones with the Cave Story, it's a small game, but I think it's my first step.<br>In the future, I will make a more unique and fun game with my own color. <br>Thank you for your support until then. <br>by Sungjun Jo (NOXBIX)",
