Up to 6 different ships can clash in the Arena, taking advantage of all of the <strong>unique and balanced skills</strong> each of them owns. Fast, precise, powerful: the gameplay is easy to learn but hard to master, adaptable to many <strong>play styles</strong> thanks to the variety of situations the player is brought to encounter.<br><br>This version is a very limited demonstration of the full game.",
