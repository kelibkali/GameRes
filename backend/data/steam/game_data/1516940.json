The reason is that I continue to refine it in every aspect, from graphics to gameplay, trying to make the most of your feedback. Unfortunately, animations in various videos (including the introductory one) will remain out of reach due to budget and equipment constraints that I'm unfortunately facing.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >For this reason, looking towards future projects, I hope you can support me, giving me the opportunity to create even better products in every aspect.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Thank you very much to all, and I hope you enjoy this first project of mine!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Happy gaming and stay indie!</p>",
