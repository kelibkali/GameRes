    "description": "DISTRIBUTE A ROOM NAME<br />\r\nWhen your participants enter the same room name, they join the VR conference. Never been easier. No matter if they join on their iOS, Android or PC with Vive or Oculus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDRAW IS MORE THAN 1000 WORDS<br />\r\nDraw like you never can in video calls. Walk up to the whiteboard and get to understand each other. Draw together. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDRAW IN 3D TOGETHER<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSHARE YOUR REAL LIFE<br />\r\nWhen you want to share something that can be viewed from your camera - you just do it. It opens up a large TV for all the other participants, right in front of them, so they can see your world. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMEET YOUR VIRTUAL YOU<br />\r\nGo to a partner and get your 3D scan. Then it is available in the VR conference so your friends can see it is you - like never before.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPRESENT ANYTHING VISIBLE IN A BROWSER<br />\r\nAgenda, Powerpoint, Maps, Google documents, Excel, Trello, Jira. Almost any modern tool, document or presentation can be viewed through a browser. Hint: copy the url of the presentation before -  then 1-click present. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSHARE YOUR ENVIRONMENT<br />\r\nTake an 360 image with your mobile or e.g. Ricoh Theta, and bring your meeting with 1-click to a completely new environment and keep communicating. No matter if it is another conference room, a new car model or a beach.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSHARE 3D MODELS<br />\r\nUpload your 3D models of for example apartments, 3d CAD, city models and discuss them in a new way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSupports Vive, Oculus, iOS and Android.",
