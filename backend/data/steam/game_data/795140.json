Each action performed increases resource count, or hourly/daily resource incomes. The player must balance incomes in order to meet colonist consumption needs as well as construction and upgrade requirement costs.<br><br>In <i>Roanoke</i>, the story follows the real-life tale of The Lost Colony - a colony that once existed and has since mysteriously vanished.<br><br><strong>Build:</strong><br>The player is capable of building the following:<br><i>Camps: +1 Gold/Hour.</i><br><i>Ports: +50 Gold/Day.</i><br><i>Farms: +3 Food/Day.</i><br><i>Homes: +1 Colonist/Day.</i><br><i>Mines: +1 Stone/Hour.</i><br><br><strong>All of these buildings can be upgraded, indefinitely, for a flat fee of 100 stone per upgrade. When upgraded, they provide 2x income, 3x income when upgraded again, and so on and so forth.</strong><br><br><strong>Gather:</strong> <br>The player is capable of gathering the following:<br><i>Food: The bread and butter of the colony.</i><br><i>Gold: Reflects score, but may also be used to permanently increase daily resource income of your choice by 1 at a port for 50g.</i><br><i>Stone: Used for upgrades.</i><br><i>Wood: Required for all buildings.</i><br><br><strong>Gatherable resources regenerate daily, but can also be gained each hour/day by constructing specific buildings and/or upgrading the port.</strong><br><br><strong>Upgrade:</strong><br>The player is capable of upgrading the following:<br><i>Camps</i><br><i>Ports</i><br><i>Farms</i><br><i>Homes</i><br><i>Mines</i><br><br><strong>Each upgrade adds the original benefits once more on top of the current building's benefits. So, if a camp provided 1 Gold/Hour it would provide 2 Gold/Hour when upgraded. This can be done indefinitely with the cost of 100 stone per upgrade.</strong>",
