    "description": "A few years after the events of Robot Female Hero one. A strange girl wakes up in a large facility, after fighting off an army of failed robotic prototypes. She's introduced the the freedom filled land, ERICA. After wandering about, she meets a small little creature by the name of ZAT. Zat informs the girl that the entire world is being threatened by the REMAINERS.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWho are the Remainers you ask? Hell if I know.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith her new found friend beside her, she'll set out on a glorious adventure! She'll meet a whole cast of homicidal mad men, teenage gods, robotic school girls, and prehistoric creatures brought back after millions of years being dead.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is a standard RPG with a cheeky sense of humor just a step above 90's gross-out humor.",
