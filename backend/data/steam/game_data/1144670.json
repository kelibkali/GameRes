    "description": "Welcome to the Tactikk. This is a turn-based strategy game. You control the killer and go through the guards and workers. Your goal is to get to the door and eliminate targets if possible. You make a move - the opponent also makes a move. The movement occurs strictly along the lines, the direction of movement affects the attacking side. Some targets may also turn or stand still.",
