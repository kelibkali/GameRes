    "description": "The wail of a distant shakuhachi, the thunder of taiko drums across the plains – the sounds you hear as the witch Takiyasha’s darkness sweeps over Japan. Composed by Danny Lopatka, The Wind and Wilting Blossom soundtrack features 12 original tracks ranging from moody overworld themes to driving battle songs. Fuses traditional Japanese instrumentation with modern influences for haunting, inescapable melodies. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAvailable in .mp3 and lossless .wav formats.",
