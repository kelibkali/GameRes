You decide when and where it will dock. And you have to help passengers find their connections. But travellers will also spend time in your Intergalactic Transfer Hub, where they can eat, shop, sleep - and spend money! Remember that different species have different needs. And some maybe dangerous!<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1267690/extras/0c95978e5d64a8251ca0ea2d8c2904b9.poster.avif?t=1771495666\" width=600 height=338 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1267690/extras/0c95978e5d64a8251ca0ea2d8c2904b9.webm?t=1771495666\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1267690/extras/0c95978e5d64a8251ca0ea2d8c2904b9.mp4?t=1771495666\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Expect the unexpected</h2>Terrorists.
