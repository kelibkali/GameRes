    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >  Pathfinder RPG - Campaign Setting: Dragon Empires Gazetteer</h2>It is a land where honorable samurai wage war against devious ninja. Where the guardian spirits known as kami stand against the ravages of evil oni. Where the martial artists of a shattered empire strive to maintain their traditions against rising chaos. A land of jade and tea, of pride and treachery, of reincarnation and vengeful ghosts. These are the lands of the Dragon Empires.<br>Dragon Empires Gazetteer presents the first exploration of the continent of Tian Xia, a vast realm found on the opposite side of the world of Golarion from the Inner Sea region. Inspired by the fascinating myths and rich histories of numerous Asian cultures and traditions, the Dragon Empires can be either an exotic destination for world-traveling heroes from the far side of the world, or they can be the foundation of an entirely new campaign.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Inside this 64-page book, you will find:<br></li><li>Details on over two dozen nations and regions of the vast continent of Tian Xia, including Minkai (a land under the rule of the notorious Jade Regent), Quain (a realm of martial artists and strange spirits), the Wall of Heaven (the world's largest and most dangerous mountain range), and Xa Hoi (an ancient empire ruled by a dragon king).<br></li><li>Rules for five new player character races (the foxlike kitsune, the reptilian nagaji, the spiritual samsarans, the crafty tengus, and the shadowy wayangs).<br></li><li>Details on the core 20 deities of the Dragon Empires.<br></li><li>A timeline of Tian Xia's long and eventful history.<br></li><li>Information about Dragon Empires society, factions and philosophies, the zodiac, languages, and more!  </li></ul>   Dragon Empires Gazetteer is intended for use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and the Pathfinder campaign setting, but can easily be used in any fantasy game setting.<br>by Matthew Goodall, Dave Gross, James Jacobs, Steve Kenson, Michael Kortes, Colin McComb, Rob McCreary, Richard Pett, F.
