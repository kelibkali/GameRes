    "description": "This game is my take on the block-placing puzzle genre. <strong>The pieces don't rotate, but there is no gravity. Place them anywhere!</strong> Complete a line or a column and those block pieces disappear. Score bonus points for completing multiple lines at once, or for completing combo chains, or both.<br><br>You can choose to race against the clock, or take all of the time in the world. There are three modes to play: a <strong>Time Attack </strong>(a two minute challenge), <strong>Survival </strong>(where you score bonus time for completing lines), and <strong>Timeless </strong>(where there is no clock at all, and you have a set number of turns instead).<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1098250/extras/87171bc0ba40f2a115393ab7569b6331.poster.avif?t=1562615971\" width=608 height=274 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1098250/extras/87171bc0ba40f2a115393ab7569b6331.webm?t=1562615971\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1098250/extras/87171bc0ba40f2a115393ab7569b6331.mp4?t=1562615971\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>There is a fourth mode, called <strong>The Quest</strong>, which is a preview of a story I need to tell. How Grid Magic is real, and how we are all players in a game, until we choose to break the rules and make our own. I wonder if this description will be read, or understood. I hope so.<br><br>Besides, what's the point of being a technical witch if I can't wield some magic with your game?<br><br>If you want to pretend that all of this is marketing text, that's great. I've made a nifty puzzle game that I hope you will enjoy. Or maybe, just maybe, this game is the start of something a bit more important.<br><br>Join me. <i><strong>Join us.</strong></i><br><br><i>-- dera</i>",
