    "description": "Hearken back to the days of Flash games and resume humanity's urge to fire kittens out of cannons. Except this time, it's all about firing them off into space at *evil* flying horses. Well, maybe they're not evil. We don't know. Honestly, we don't care. Here are the great things you can expect:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Not that hard!<br></li><li> Low playtime!<br></li><li> Low replayability value!<br></li><li> Gravity in space?<br></li><li> But the gravity doesn't affect the horses?!<br></li><li> What are those planets there for if you can't hit them?!?!<br></li><li> DOESN'T MATTER. KITTENS. IN. CANNONS.</li></ul>",
