Flip quick profits at the Scrap Yard, hold your stock for market spikes, or slowly build your scrapping empire through smart investments and careful planning.<br><br>Each playthrough is shaped by dynamic, RNG-driven systems. Weather conditions influence solar power efficiency. Daily discarded items vary. PCs, Servers, and Laptops can contain hundreds of possible component combinations depending on their RAM and hardware configurations. Market prices fluctuate — and above all, your decisions determine the outcome.<br><br>After the tutorial, you're on your own. There are no level-to-item lockouts, no forced progression paths, and no hand-holding. Guidance comes primarily through in-game descriptions — ignoring them or rushing decisions can be costly.<br><br>There is no “Game Over” screen — but poor investments, unpaid utility bills, inefficient upgrade paths, or reckless spending can leave you struggling to recover. Read carefully. Plan ahead. Choose wisely. Your success (or hardship) is entirely yours to shape.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong><i><u>🛠️ Features</u></i></strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>🔍 Scavenge &amp; Salvage</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Head out early each morning to secure the best finds before rival scrappers beat you to them. Not all junk is worth your time — learning what to take (and what to leave behind) is part of the strategy.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>📈 Watch the Market</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Track fluctuating prices on your in-game PC. Sell refined metals at the <strong>Scrap Yard</strong>, or offload low-tier electronics at the <strong>Pawn Shop</strong> to free up time and storage for higher-value targets. Timing and focus directly impact your profits.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>🔥 Smelt &amp; Refine</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Reinvest your earnings into a <strong>Furnace Set, Crucible, and Ingot Moulds</strong> to forge high-value <strong>Ingots</strong>. Upgrade further with a Chemical Set to extract pure <strong>Gold</strong> and <strong>Silver</strong> for premium returns.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>🛒 Upgrade Your Tools</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Visit the Hardware Store to unlock better tools, solar panels to reduce utility costs, improved item transport options, expanded storage, and other efficiency-focused upgrades. Spend wisely — not every upgrade provides immediate returns.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>💪 Level Up &amp; Unlock Perks</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Earn XP in <strong>Disassembling</strong>, <strong>Trading</strong>, and <strong>Scavenging</strong> to gain perk points across three distinct skill trees. Specialise your playstyle and refine your strategy to maximise productivity and long-term profit.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🧩 <strong>E-Waste You’ll Deconstruct:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>LCD &amp; CRT TVs</strong></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Personal Computers &amp; Laptops</strong></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Microwaves &amp; DVD Players</strong></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Game Consoles</strong></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Servers, Routers &amp; HDDs</strong></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>GPUs, RAM (2–32GB DDR3/DDR4) &amp; Power Supplies</strong></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>…and many more to come!</i></p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🔩 <strong>Internal Parts Include:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>CPUs</strong>, <strong>IC Chips</strong>, <strong>BGA Chips</strong></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Capacitors</strong>, <strong>Transformers</strong>, <strong>Crystal Oscillators</strong></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Power Boards</strong>, <strong>Motherboards</strong>, <strong>CD Drives</strong></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Screws</strong>, <strong>Heat Sinks</strong>, <strong>Network Cards</strong></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Each component yields unique materials inspired by its real-world counterpart.</i></p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Side Missions &amp; Energy Management</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Take on optional jobs from <strong>Scrapper Joe</strong> for extra cash. Need to push through a long day? Grab a coffee from <strong>Kaz</strong> at <strong>“Feen 4 Caffeine”</strong> to restore energy and keep working.<br><br>Efficiency matters. Hoarding every item you find will eventually slow you down. Sometimes it's smarter to pawn off low-value electronics and focus on high-yield systems like PCs, laptops, and servers. Managing time, storage, and workload is just as important as dismantling itself.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >🧠 Developer’s Note:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><i>Scrapping Simulator</i> is a stylised exaggeration of today’s throwaway culture. It’s about uncovering value in the forgotten. Where some see trash on the curb, others see opportunity — raw materials waiting to be reclaimed.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This is a simulator built on freedom, consequence, and discovery. There is no single “correct” path — only the one you carve out for yourself.</p>",
