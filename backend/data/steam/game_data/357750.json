But during the sacrifice, something went wrong. Enraged, the gods punished the Mayan people, who then disappeared. This disappearance wasn't immediate, though. Earthquakes, droughts, and volcanic eruptions came one after the other, ultimately leading to the fall of the empire.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/357750/extras/735e4607bff796af28fd697555f20fe8.avif?t=1452080561\" width=600 height=334 /></span><br><br>In the present day, the gods returned to claim what was theirs, but the Mayans are no longer around to perform the sacrifices. Alex, the dean of a small university, lives in distress over this, and when the appointed date, December 21, 2012, arrives, he starts to lose his mind. In the following months, he starts collecting news about natural disasters: eruptions, earthquakes, hurricanes. Things that were always there, but his sick mind connects them with the wrath of the gods over not receiving their gift. Alex therefore decides to do the sacrifices himself.<br><br><strong>The problem is that today, virgins are really hard to find.</strong><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/357750/extras/2de41598911ff79c244b8b15c5f6b5ab.avif?t=1452080561\" width=600 height=380 /></span><br><br>Using his position, he founds a fraternity in his university and tricks the dumbest virgin boys that he finds into joining. Alex promises them that if they finish their studies, he'll take them to Riviera Maya as an end-of-term trip. Using an outing as a ruse, he plans to sacrifice them at the top of Chichen Itza.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/357750/extras/336a2b40a6d8c6762b2bbf8499c85c47.avif?t=1452080561\" width=600 height=336 /></span><br><br>Will Alex complete his evil plan?
