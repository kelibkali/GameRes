ASTRA-256 isn’t just a computer — it’s a complete educational environment where you write real Assembler code for a virtual von Neumann architecture machine.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>LEARN BY PLAYING</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >ASTRA-256 is:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >An interactive simulator for learning Assembler from scratch.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A logic puzzle for those who love “real” programming.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >A nostalgic time machine for veterans of the LPG-30, Altair 8800, and PDP-11.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >This is the kind of machine pioneers of computing once used to solve real problems — under tight resource constraints, just like in the 1970s.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>WHY LEARN ASSEMBLER?</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Assembler is the language the machine truly understands. It’s not obsolete — it’s foundational.</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Still used in microcontrollers and embedded systems</strong>: from home appliances and automotive electronics to medical devices and IoT.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Gives you full control over the hardware</strong> — drivers, firmware, DSP, memory, and registers.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Essential for cybersecurity</strong>: reverse engineering, malware analysis, hacking, and low-level defense.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Helps you understand</strong> how high-level languages like Java, C++, and Python work under the hood.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" ><strong>Reveals the essence of computation</strong> — how bits become intelligence, how stacks, memory, and ALUs operate.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Understand Assembler, and you’ll understand how everything else works.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>WHAT CAN ASTRA-256 DO?</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >8-bit processor with accumulator and visible registers: IP, IN, OUT, SP, FLAGS.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >256 bytes of memory — just like the original Altair 8800 released in 1975 with the Intel 8080.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >75 instructions grouped by purpose: control flow, data movement, arithmetic, stack, I/O, and more.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Lessons and documentation in five languages — printable, just like in the good old days.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Start with simple programs and progress to complex algorithms: square roots, trigonometry, even mini-games.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >ASTRA-256 runs on a custom Assembler designed specifically for this environment. We intentionally offer an extended instruction set — similar to what you’ll find in modern microcontrollers and processors.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >It’s a hands-on way to gain foundational experience with low-level hardware logic — the kind that prepares you to work with any modern microcontroller. The principles haven’t changed.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>PLAY, LEARN, PROGRAM</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Everything you need is built in: editor, debugger, help system.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Everything is real: memory, registers, instructions.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Everything is here to help you understand how computers truly work — not at the interface level, but at the bit level.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Who knows — maybe you’ll be the one to write the program that sends Elon Musk to Mars.</p>",
