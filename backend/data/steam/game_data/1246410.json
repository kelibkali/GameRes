All of the tanks, armored vehicles, anti-tank guns, mortars, infantry, air support, and artillery will be at the tip of your fingers.  Desert Heat Battle Pack 1 includes 13 scenarios and brings the Italians, Germans, and Vichy French to fight against the British, their Commonwealth Allies from Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, the Americans, and the Free French. <br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1246410/extras/ecef131a1236b759b0d123fd68a011b9.avif?t=1640980334\" width=616 height=140 /></span><br>The names of many of these battles are well known, but Desert Heat Battlepack 1 gives you the chance to get down to the details. Mechili, Tobruk, Gazala, Sidi Rezegh, El Alamein, Germans Kasserine Pass, Medjez-el-Bab, Faid, El Guettar, and more. New to the system are obstacles such as Wire and Anti-Tank Ditches. And what would desert combat be without that ever-unpredictable variable: Dust. It’s Panzer IIs, IIIs, and IVs against M3 Lees and M5 Stuarts. It’s M13/40s and L3s against Crusaders, Valentines, and M3 Grants. It’s Armored Infantry in desperate close assaults. It’s ATGs, air support, and mines.",
