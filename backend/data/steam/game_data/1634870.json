    "description": "Open Brush allows you to paint in 3D space with XR. Unleash your creativity with three-dimensional brush strokes. Your canvas is open around you. Your palette is your imagination. Your inspiration is everywhere.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour freedom comes the moment you move your head to one side, and see your strokes from a different perspective.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom here, Open Brush will treat you to a palette of 48 different brush types, freed from the bounds of typical painting media. Fire, water, smoke and light beams are just a selection of the wonderful brushes you’ll find. A large selection of environments will find you floating in space, creating costumes, or enjoying a snowy walk.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnything is possible in Open Brush. Transport yourself across the cosmos, or jump through the frames of famous portraits and see what lies beyond. The choice is yours.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOpen Brush is the community powered evolution of Tilt Brush from Google, originally developed by Skillman &amp; Hackett.",
