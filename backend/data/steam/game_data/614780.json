While such disputes among the fey are not uncommon, it is rare for these hostilities to escalate into warfare.</i><br><i>Coilltean Grove is tended by a dryad caretaker named Flrlainn. She has unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a truce between the Briarvine and Thornbranch sprite tribes  even offering to evenly divide her home between them if it would stop the war. When diplomacy failed she resorted to using force to dissuade them from their actions which prompted the sprites to set her most beloved tree ablaze.</i><br>5E Mini-Dungeons are small adventures for 5th Edition which are setting agnostic and are easily inserted anywhere in your campaign.<br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included 5E Ruleset.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong>Anthony Rush</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included 5E Compatible ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
