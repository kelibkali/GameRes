I'm a big walking simulator fan, and I've always wanted to play one with a very psychedelic feel, a lot of interaction with the environment and experimental music that would be a bit interactive. This game is the first one I've made and will release. I can't wait to show it to the world!<br><br>Since it's my first game as a solo dev, it's gonna be free. There will be no ads or informations taken from you, it's just a small weird experiment for you to play. It's gonna last somewhere between 30 and 60 minutes. I've put all my heart in this project!<br><br>I've been helped by Thomas Duret, who co-wrote the story and gave me a lot of feedback on the game. There's also Catherine Côté-Moisescu who helped me with social medias. Voice acting is made by Sarah Albu and David E. Cronkite.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1461130/extras/81c53fe3153cfb2353402afb6a63e1d0.poster.avif?t=1768101438\" width=600 height=170 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1461130/extras/81c53fe3153cfb2353402afb6a63e1d0.webm?t=1768101438\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1461130/extras/81c53fe3153cfb2353402afb6a63e1d0.mp4?t=1768101438\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br><br>The game is currently under development.
