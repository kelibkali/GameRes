    "description": "Maze Ablaze is a fast-paced strategy game where you move the walls of a maze to defend an explosive barrel from an oncoming flame! Move fast and think faster as you work with limited resources to survive as long as possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis deceptively challenging game is all about optimizing your moves and thinking ahead of time. The mechanics are simple, but the strategies are anything but simple.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplore 40 levels across 3 worlds in a layout that allows you to go at your own pace. You may want to steadily knock out level after level, or become obsessed with achieving perfection on a single level.",
