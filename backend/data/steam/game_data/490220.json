Meanwhile, the planet's frigid dark side has been colonized by an enigmatic faction of intelligent machines that threaten humanity with conflict.<br><br><br>In these new cybernetic times, human soldiers are obsolete. Instead, warfare is conducted swiftly with massive armies of robots. The <i>Swarmwielders</i>—human commanders of these mechanical forces—are the defenders of society, training relentlessly for the day when the machines strike again.
