    "description": "During a raging 2236 snowstorm, an unmanned icebreaker brings Freeman Frag to St. Jude, a seaside Antarctic community populated by upper-crust expats who maintain homicidal robots as a way to delight dinner guests. By way of medical interventions – the Ymir Protocol – the vast majority of local citizens live greatly-extended lifespans with dramatically-lowered body temperatures, blue skin, and increased sensitivities to heat. Permanent cabin fever has set in...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon't expect things to go *ding* every time a quest ends or display an *experience gained* banner across the screen when Freeman has points available to invest in stats. If things feel difficult, players can pop open the stats screen and decide what to improve. Anticipate mechanical minions and chat with quirky NPCs; look elsewhere for bullet hell boss battles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChurch of the Midnight Sailor was developed with a Commodore Plus/4 color palette.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a game about evolving in order to become a better person.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuggestions: Avoid spending experience carelessly, as some dialogue options have stat requirements; conversations can be started or stopped at any time based on proximity. Simply walk closer or run away. And don't forget to check in with Fry, Freeman's built-in AI.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf combat feels tough: Plasma Ejector and Tech contribute to ranged damage, and raising the Plasma Ejector rating allows Freeman to carry more plasmaPaks to recharge his ranged attack; raising the Health rating will allow Freeman to carry more medPaks. Sabre Damage and Buff both contribute to melee damage. Raising the Roll rating will make evading enemies MUCH easier.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote that controls are keyboard-based: WASD (movement), Q (quest screen), O (stats), H(HUD), M (save/options menu), J (plasma-sabre), K (roll), L (plasma ejector), U (medPak), I (plasmaPak), F (Fry), TAB (move within menus).",
