    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Overview</h2><br>&quot;PegSoli+&quot; is a game based on the rules of the classic board game Peg Solitaire (or Solo Noble), with some modifications. This game includes a &quot;Problems Mode&quot; to solve preset problems, an &quot;Arcade Mode&quot; to compete for speed with automatically generated problems, and an &quot;Edit Mode&quot; to create original problems.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Basic Rules</h2><br>A peg (piece) can be moved by jumping over one other adjacent peg, and the jumped over peg is removed from the board. No more than a peg can be jumped over, and no pegs can be moved if there is already a peg at the destination. The game is cleared when there is only one peg left on the board.<br><br>Once you have one peg remaining, the problem is clear, but it can be completely cleared by meeting the following requirements.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Solve problems within the specified number of steps: Steps are not counted if the same peg is moved consecutively. The key is to move as many consecutive pegs as possible.<br></li><li>Centering: It is achieved when the last peg is placed in the center of the board.</li></ul><br>Some problems have a set stock of pegs. The stocks can be placed anywhere on the board, and all stocks must be used up to complete the problem.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Board Types</h2><br>&quot;PegSoli+&quot; has 3 types of boards.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>English style</li></ul>This board consists of 33 holes.
