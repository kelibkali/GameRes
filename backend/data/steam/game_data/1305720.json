    "description": "The year is 1988. Adventure game developer Delores Edmund, on hiatus from her job at MMucasFlem Games, has returned to Thimbleweed Park for a quick vacation. While she’s home, she’s making some extra money as a photographer for the Thimbleweed Nickel News. Hey, game developers need to eat, too!<br><br>Thimbleweed Park hasn’t changed at all in the year since Delores has been away… or has it? <br><br>…Since when is the S&amp;D Diner a five-star establishment?<br>…When did the PillowBear™ become all the rage?<br>…Why is Ransome the Clown suddenly winning humanitarian awards? <br>…How come no one seems to remember that dead body that turned up under the bridge a year ago?<br>…Can Thimbleweed Park get any stranger?!.<br><br>In a town like Thimbleweed Park, a side career in photojournalism is the least of your problems...<br><br><strong>Delores: A Thimbleweed Park Mini-Adventure</strong> started out as a prototype for Ron Gilbert’s new point-and-click adventure game engine and grew into a fun little game. It is not a sequel to Thimbleweed Park and is probably missing all of the small bells and whistles that would make it a commercially viable game.<br><br>This was a challenging game to make because we had to use almost exclusively “found art” from Thimbleweed Park to create all new puzzles. Also because we couldn’t go outside IRL.<br><br>As a thank you to our fans, we are releasing it for free as something you can have fun with in these odd times. You don’t have to have played Thimbleweed Park to enjoy this mini-adventure. (But if you do enjoy it, why not check out Thimbleweed Park, hmm?)<br><br>Key Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Non-stop point-and-click fun!<br></strong></li><li><strong>Return to Thimbleweed Park</strong>, the setting of the Best Adventure of 2017 award from Adventure Gamers and the Thank You for Not Still Living at Home award from Ron Gilbert’s mom. (Or, visit Thimbleweed Park for the first time! No prior knowledge required to play!)<br></li><li><strong>Explore Main Street and solve puzzles</strong> to take pictures for Thimbleweed Park’s hard-hitting newspaper. One of these days Natalie will get that Pulitzer, and it will be thanks to your help!<br></li><li><strong>Tackle increasingly difficult assignments</strong> as you get closer to figuring out what the heck is going on in Thimbleweed Park this time.<br></li><li><strong>Sample a new adventure game engine</strong> by Ron Gilbert, who created Lucasfilm’s SCUMM engine and classic games Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island back in the day.</li></ul>",
