    "description": "Humankind has faced earthquakes, volcanoes, floods and hurricanes—but the most dangerous natural disaster is a weather phenomenon known as the &quot;Tornuffalo.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA &quot;Tornuffalo&quot; is formed when a layer of warm, moist air meets a layer of cold, dry air which meets a herd of angry buffalo.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote: A true meteorozoologist would explain that &quot;buffalo&quot; is an informal term that, in this case, refers to American bison.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDodge fire hydrants, vans and even bison in this room-scale VR game. Hit gems to score points. Make sure to have ample space, and play with the &quot;chaperone grid&quot; on so you don't run into a wall!",
