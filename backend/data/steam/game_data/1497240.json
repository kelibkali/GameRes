    "description": "LoopWorlds is a game of difficult logic puzzles, with disco dance-floor graphics. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter each stage of 8 levels, a new game mechanic will be added, including sliding ice blocks, button-activated walls, and portals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPress the arrow keys to move the disco ball in that direction, and it will keep moving until it hits something. Also if the disco ball leaves a screen edge, it will loop back in again on the opposite side, making for a very interesting brain challenge. It gets pretty epic!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can also create and save your own awesome levels and let your family try them out later.",
