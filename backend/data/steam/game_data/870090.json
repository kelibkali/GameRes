    "description": "Lems is a VR Reverse Platformer. May very well be the first of its kind! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this game, players have to save little creatures called Lems. <br />\r\nThey are on predefined paths known to the player and filled with obstacles and traps.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn order to succeed in his task, the player utilizes little platforms attached to his VR controllers that will follow their every movement. These platforms have unique properties (there are 4 different types of platforms currently in the game) and the player must use them in order to carry the Lems and make sure they arrive to destination. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere can be up to 4  spawners in a level and up to 4 Lems in a single spawner. It's a game about agility and analysing the level design in order to make the best out of each level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll the levels are contained in an area of 2m². However, there is a scaling system in order to make the game accessible to everybody -- no matter the size -- and ensure they have a similar experience. Warning : the scaling system is here to ensure that people of different size (from approximately 1M50 to 2M20) enjoys the same experience. You should not buy this game if you don't have a playable area of 2m².<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are currently 50+ Levels available, with 3 different difficulty modes to activate individually or together to spice things up!",
