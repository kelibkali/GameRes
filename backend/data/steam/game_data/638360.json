    "description": "<i>This mod will feature UN-skippable monologue and dialogue. You have been warned!</i><br><br>July, 1883. Half-Rats is, as he usually seems to be; down on his luck and fretting for the future. One fateful night, he carelessly decides to drown his sorrows with strong libations - and he runs up a tab at a pub he knows he can't pay...Remarkably; Instead of a reproachful speech and coarse removal, he is instead told a tale he can hardly believe. A tale involving great riches, but even greater peril. If he was not so desperate, he wouldn't conceive of embarking on what could be a wild goose chase to locate a forgotten and virtually unknown town. Half-Rats' doubts were abated somewhat when the publican shews his utmost sincerity - albeit in a strange and effusive manner - and draws him a rude map.<br><br>&quot;Thank the lord, for he smote that place from the Earth in '81. We lived, but most met their destruction the night that liberating conflagration visited freedom upon us. We're the last of 'em...There was a vault in the bank, large sums of money would have been stole away there, safe. We vowed never to go back, to keep that place a dread secret until tonight.&quot;<br><br>The seemingly mythical town in question is referred to as &quot;Eminence&quot;. With no other hope to speak of, and fearing that this may be treachery after all; Half-Rats is still compelled to begin this peregrination to his &quot;El Dorado&quot; with weapons at the ready. But he'll find much more than gold and banknotes before his journey is through. All is not what it seems, and he'll find a living, livid hell to contend with...And the close of a dilemma he'd all but forgotten.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><br>- Brand new maps.
