The game allows you to search for fast duels with anyone or duel the IA in several rounds to decide who wins and who losses. There are several characters available, different weapons to use and even additional modes that let you practice your aim through different types of challenges (such as shooting cans in your ranch). <br>But none of that accurately describes the best of Unforgiven VR: the thrill of facing another player knowing that only one of you can win… and the other one will die.<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/546210/extras/92eafa265f3e39685dbedaf036b45625.avif?t=1513336113\" width=615 height=346 /></span><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/546210/extras/168d184b6b2f1c29104db732970c7b92.avif?t=1513336113\" width=615 height=107 /></span><br><br>Select one of the available characters and start your journey in the wild west.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/546210/extras/9d119aadc740bed74391e72ed6136187.avif?t=1513336113\" width=615 height=250 /></span><br><br>-- A new character is coming to the town every few weeks --<br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/546210/extras/255d8737c3fcf179ded2533c35f8547d.avif?t=1513336113\" width=615 height=107 /></span><br>Dueling is hard and dangerous, not everyone is gifted with the ability to shoot a weapon, but practise makes perfection and in the training field you will be able to shoot some objects to tune your aim before challenging someone.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/546210/extras/1434c65b6e3ecb70ff4c0751dd0a68a8.avif?t=1513336113\" width=615 height=346 /></span><br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/546210/extras/37ae33160f31c86e824511e0441c436d.avif?t=1513336113\" width=615 height=107 /></span><br>We divided our development in different stages grouping features. To be playable some of the early stages will have temporary systems that will be replaced with the final ones when all the pieces are there. Next you can find an approximation of what will include every stage:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Stage 1: Any Gun Can Play</h2>You will be able to select one of the 4 characters and challenge other online people or the AI to duel on 1 scenario and score for a leaderboard based on your win/loss ratio. Do you need to improve your aim? No problem, you can go to the training area to practise.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Stage 2: The Saloon opens its doors</h2>Tired of shooting your friends? Take a break in the saloon, play poker with other people or join a knife throwing game while you wait for someone to duel you. The training area will be enhanced with challenges like “shoot three times in the air that can”. What you want more shooting? No problem, there will be new characters and scenarios to play with.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Stage 3: Become a legend of the wild west</h2>Forget about the old leaderboard. Now you will have to create a character and start your journey to become a true legend. Duel someone for a fistfull of dollars, but be careful, now you can get hurt or even die, and it will mean to lose your character and creating a new one. Ah, and remember, now your ammo will deplete, go to the general store and buy some more. As usual, new characters, weapons and scenarios will come with a enhanced saloon with more places to interact with.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Stage 4: The Town becomes a city</h2>Dress like a sir, die like the rest, more aesthetic and gameplay complements, you know, a good flask in the pocket could stop a bullet. But be cautious, being hurt in a duel will make easier to be killed in the next, take a break to restore your health or… visit the barber and it will fix you up in a minute… for a price. Not the only new pal in the city, new characters will come and a new NPC, the undertaker, that will immortalize you in the Valley of Crosses. Last but not least, sometimes we will be able to find special cards that will come with item drops.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Extra Stage: Magnificent 7</h2>Group with your friends for the ultimate dueling experience. Will you try to rob the bank? Be careful, maybe there are other parties that will try to stop you.",
