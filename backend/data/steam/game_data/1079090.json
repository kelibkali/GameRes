    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Meanders Map Pack: Fantasy City Nocturnal</h2>This exciting new series of map packs will finally open up the option for building huge destinations to which all the other hundreds of Meanders can lead.<br>This pack features a huge assortment of 30 New Maps from my Fantasy City Kickstarter with multi-tier building and street exteriors including a Red Light District map unique to this pack. It is set in the evening after-dark - whereby most goods have been carefully ushered in off the street, many traders have shut away their canopies and the streets and alleys are lit with an array of flickering torch and lantern lights.Explore the slums of the poorer districts and wind your way through sketchy alleyways lurking with hidden dangers. Tread the paved stones of the upper echelon and visit the High Streets and their trade markets amid swirling tendrils of smoke. Lose yourself in the meandering clusters of buildings, on the street, by rooftop or even delve below ground into the ominous sewers. Enjoy the ability to easily blend your new cities with existing core Meander terrains such as Jungle, Ice, Forest and Desert creating continuity throughout your session. Maps are compatible with standard, seasonal and other Meanders Fantasy City Map Packs.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Forest Road Castle Entrance Blender<br></li><li>Desert Road Castle Entrance Blender<br></li><li>Swamp/Jungle Road Castle Entrance Blender<br></li><li>Ice Road Castle Entrance Blender<br></li><li>Castle Gate Courtyard Horizontal Entrance<br></li><li>Castle Gate Courtyard Vertical Entrance<br></li><li>Cathedral and Inn<br></li><li>Main Street Diagonal<br></li><li>Main Street Diagonal B<br></li><li>House Garden Cluster with Well and Stairs<br></li><li>Main Street with Stairs to Terraced Houses<br></li><li>Houses and Apple Pickers with Well<br></li><li>Rough Main Street Meat Cleavers<br></li><li>Main Street Narrow Alley Market Street<br></li><li>Barricaded Street Alley with Thieves Hideout<br></li><li>Main Street with Forge, Inn and Market<br></li><li>Industrial Cluster and Courtyard<br></li><li>High Street Tavern and Boarding<br></li><li>Fenced Cathedral<br></li><li>Poor District A<br></li><li>Poor District B<br></li><li>Twin Cluster with Central Courtyard<br></li><li>Main Street Merchants Alley<br></li><li>Main Street Dockyard Market<br></li><li>Offstreet Well and Rough Courtyard<br></li><li>Poor District Crowded Narrow Cluster<br></li><li>High Street Market and Henge<br></li><li>High Street Tavern and Sewer Alley Entrance<br></li><li>Tavern Courtyard Cluster<br></li><li>Red Light District</li></ul>Maps are sized specially for FG at 1350x900 and under 500 kb each to help prevent slow-down during play.
