    "description": "Hi! My name is Sumy Pac-Shell and I belong to the Sumy Shell family.<br><br>This is the franchise first game in which I participate.

For that reason, I am unique, not being multiple, now returning to the ORIMON franchise...<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1588620/extras/657b2f37347a1316a5a1695db1e17c5f.avif?t=1621260673\" width=580 height=164 /></span><br><br>The word ORIMON is the fusion of two terms, ORIGIN + MONSTERS.
