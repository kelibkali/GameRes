    "description": "&quot;The Land of Crows&quot; is an side-scroller gothic story adventure game (<u>not</u> a point &amp; click), inspired by the literary works of the Masters of pre-romantic, romantic and gothic literature (E.A. Poe, J.W. Goethe, A. Mickiewicz, J. Slowacki) and lovecraftian mythos. Jan Bonawentura Jablonowski, a young Polish nobleman, is summoned to Kuyavia at his friend's request. Urged by a dramatic letter, he arrives to a gloomy, rainy flatland filled with ravens and crows. He's about to find out the dreadful truth lurking in the watery grasslands of the 19th century Partitioned Poland. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A classic-style adventure game, inspired by the 90s thriller adventures look, feel &amp; controls (most notably &quot;The Shadow of The Comet&quot;)<br></li><li>3 to 4 hours of entertainment, 7000+ lines of text.<br></li><li>Gloomy characters with their dark secrets.<br></li><li>The gothic romance sending chills down the spine.<br></li><li>Climatic music (by Simon Wilkinson and other composers).<br></li><li>Historical and ethnographic objects and buildings (palaces, mansions, churches) of Kuyavian/Greater Poland style.<br></li><li>References to 19th century masters of gothic and romantic literature.<br></li><li>The look and feel of the Regency/Romanticism cultural era, with a Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth distinct cultural background.<br></li><li>Regional, early medieval Slavic legends of Kuyavia, intertwined with a romantic vibe.<br></li><li>Haunted forests of old with ancient hidden graves.<br></li><li>A lot of walking.<br></li><li>An eons-old evil lurking in the marshlands...</li></ul><br>This game is not a &quot;talkie&quot; - it doesn't have a voice-over (a classical 90s adventure game indie tribute).",
