The original prototype had only 4 levels, each of a different color: purple, brown, blue and white. There was only one boss fight originally at the very end. Due to its popularity, it was determined to take this on as a full-scale project. The current team consists of only one person Super8bitRafa (lone developer). The game is currently still being updated weekly.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2026340/extras/3906da1fd36ec8e0bdc1204d1838d4a4.poster.avif?t=1666646641\" width=784 height=332 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2026340/extras/3906da1fd36ec8e0bdc1204d1838d4a4.webm?t=1666646641\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2026340/extras/3906da1fd36ec8e0bdc1204d1838d4a4.mp4?t=1666646641\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span>",
