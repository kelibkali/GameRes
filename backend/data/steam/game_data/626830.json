    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Of Drow Origin</strong></h2><strong>Author: Randy Aitken</strong><br><i>Treachery. Secrets. Murder. It is a good day to be a Drow.</i><br>Of Drow Origin is a tale of intrigue and shifting loyalty. This one-shot module has a very high replay value, caters to new players and veterans, and features unique game play scenarios which ultimately resolve through PVP interaction (combat and noncombat).<br>Certain to appeal to all types of gamers, beautifully illustrated, and chock full of unique content and extras that make this a grab-and-go solution for DMs that want to run a game for friends, a gaming group, or an online convention. As written this game is intended for NINE players but scales well down to as few as four.<br><i>Included are three new archetypes:</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Cleric - Spider Domain<br></li><li>Druid - Circle of the Coven<br></li><li>Fighter - Blackguard</li></ul>The story takes place in a wedding ceremony setting, and is written with an emphasis on roleplay. Character levels range from two to eleven making choosing allies an all-important task. Each of the nine main characters has a short background that provides just enough ambiguity to allow players to insert themselves into the heads of their character while still making decisions that make each play-through different. By focusing on the roleplay, this game has wide appeal to all levels of experience, while still keeping the power-gamers second guessing every choice.<br>Normal run time is four hours but can vary. Replayability is VERY HIGH!<br><i>Fantasy Grounds Conversion:</i> <strong>Rob Twohy (rob2e)</strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included 5E ruleset.<br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: </i><strong></strong><br><strong>Requires:</strong> The free Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) software and the included 5E Compatible ruleset.<br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extension and ruleset you have loaded.",
