Too much Heat will attract protestors, inspectors, helicopter fly-bys, even DEA raids and shutdowns! Turn up the heat for a more engaging, fast-paced play! Follow all the rules and avoid risk for a more casual experience. <br><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/662910/extras/242c8bbad9f8333de00a9b4662510427.avif?t=1521213800\" width=596 height=188 /></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >YOU'RE NOT ALONE: MEET YOUR QUIRKY CREW</h2>Growing all these plants is hard work; hire some friends to MAKE your farm flourish.
