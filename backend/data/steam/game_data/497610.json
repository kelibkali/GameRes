    "description": "Tensions in Eastern Ukraine have been on edge since 2013 when trouble started in the Crimean Peninsula resulting in the Annexation of the region by Russia in March of 2014.  The Ukrainian separatists' ambitiondid not stop there however, and with the support of Russia the area commonly known as the DonBass (Basin of the lower Don River) erupted into civil war through the summer of 2014.  This conflict was backed by Russian Regular Army troops ‘vacationing’ in the region, followed by an intervention by the Russian 76th Guards Air Assault Division and other Russian forces. A cease fire put a temporary halt to the fighting at the end of August 2014 but Russian troop movements and occupation of the DonBass did not end.

A cease fire was put in place in July 92 but dissent, negotiation and discontent continue today.<br><br>Russia is nothing if not opportunistic.  It sees NATO as fragmented and weak, the US embroiled into a bitter election campaign, and the European Union in crisis because of constitutional challenges, and the ongoing Syrian Refugee crisis. Perhaps now is the time to make Novorossiya a reality!
