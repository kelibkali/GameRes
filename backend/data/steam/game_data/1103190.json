    "description": "In this demo you have access to the Town of Bradford, the City of Alluris, The Roads, and a network of caves. Baron Dread also descends much faster upon the city of Alluris so you'll only have 100 days to stop him. Good luck, you're going to need it!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou begin your journey on the roads outside the City of Alluris. Your goal is to travel the world, level up, and collect items, followers, and abilities until you can overcome Baron Dread and save Alluris. The game is played with the simple input of dragging cards left or right. However, the decisions you need to make can sometimes be everything but simple. Your options for dealing with a situation are dependent on your backstory, race, gender, or a prior decision you’ve made in the run.",
