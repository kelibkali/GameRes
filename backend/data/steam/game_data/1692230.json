    "description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>Once upon a time...</strong></h2>There was a prince on a mission to save a princess from the hands of a terrifying dragon. This prince, however, wasn't very brave, so his father ordered a witch to enchant a sword. This magical sword had a will of its own and was, unlike the prince, brave and wise.<br>Together they embarked on an adventure of a lifetime.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" ><strong>A fairy tale with a twist!</strong></h2>You play as the sword of the prince. Everyone in the land thinks the prince is brave and adventurous, but in reality his magical sword is all that. <br><br>Use your mouse to help the knight go through dangerous environments. <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Defeat enemies<br></li><li>Avoid spikes<br></li><li>Slay the dragon<br></li><li>Save the princess!</li></ul><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Don't like reading?</h2></strong><br>No worries. You write the story by playing it.<br>Ooh, and if you do let the prince die, we'll just tear out that page!<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Controls</h2></strong><br>You only need your mouse!<br><br>You control the sword with your mouse by moving it around. The prince will follow the sword, unless he is scared. Which happens more often than not. Because the prince is afraid of a lot of things. His fears include spikes, birds, green blobs, moles, heights, first dates, germs, fire and of course dragons!<br><br>By holding the right mouse button near the prince you can drag him to safety while he shivvers in his armor. You can also spin and swing the sword with the left mouse button to hit enemies or deflect projectiles.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >What can you expect from this game?</h2></strong><br>• 2 hours of gameplay!<br>• 25 levels<br>• Experience what it's like to be a sword",
