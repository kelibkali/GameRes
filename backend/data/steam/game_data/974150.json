With the assistance of an outrageously lovable local, you can choose from a range of experiences inspired by actual attractions while situated on the breath-taking vantage point high above Wellington city. Absorb the dawn chorus of New Zealand’s native birds amidst the beautiful native bush that surrounds the city. Busk on Cuba St as the new drummer for local band, the Orchestra Of Spheres. Run a coffee cart in crisis as the morning’s zombified commuters converge upon it for their caffeine fix. Take a jump off a diving platform on the waterfront or a dip in Wellington’s beautifully clean harbour. And be surrounded by the serenity of the star-filled night sky and welcome Matariki, Maori New Year.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/974150/extras/2149e013d2d82968e151db382878a66e.webp?t=1548894272\" width=634 height=62 /></span><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >The best New Zealand has to offer</h2>From exploring natural wonders to cultural marvels. <br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Discover</h2>The incredible lifestyle of the most walkable city in the world. <br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Play</h2>With local musos, dive into the harbour and try to stave off the Coffeepocalypse. <br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Explore </h2>Get lost in the exquisite chorus of the local bird life or surrounded by the harbours crystal waters.<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Meet the locals</h2>Made by Wellingtonians, to personally guide you through everything this city has to offer.
