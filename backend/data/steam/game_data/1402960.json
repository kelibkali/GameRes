    "description": "Challenge your friends and family virtually to our take on the classic Victorian game of Anagrams!  Type in words to claim them from the pot or to steal from your fellow players.  When all the tiles are flipped and no one can make another word, the player with the most words wins!<br />\r\nThis game was developed to bring our family together from around the globe for a classic game night during the CoVid-19 pandemic.  We hope that it does the same for yours.",
