    "description": "<strong>Take Control of Santa in this Text-Based Adventure. . .</strong><br>-----------------<br>In the cold, barren midwinter, a sole figure rises from his slumber. Kyle, readying his day, looks on that which he will encounter. . . OH MY GOODNESS, WHY ARE THERE ELVES GROWING OUT OF HIS SKIN? WHO GAVE THAT CHILD A CLAYMORE??? WHY IS RACHEL TURNING INTO A PUSS LUMP OF FLESH????<br><br><br><strong>11 New Holiday Endings to Find. . .</strong><br>-----------------<br>Kyle has been gifted a Christmas miracle in bed and is now Santa. You must help him on his Santa-ly duties to spread cheer and merriment to all those around him. New options are exposed in the world for Kyle when he is Santa, lending you some extra tidbits of dialog with the old characters.<br><br><br><strong>Woven into the World. . .</strong><br>-----------------<br>All endings in Kyle is Santa are woven into the pre-existing world of Kyle is Famous, and some items will have new functionality in Kyle's pursuit of holiday cheer.<br><br><br><strong>Kyle at His Finest</strong><br>-----------------<br>Guys, I'll be real with you. This is far more messed up and terrifying than Kyle is Famous is, in the best way possible. The writing for this was some of the best time I've had working on this project. If you enjoyed Kyle is Famous, I really honestly believe you're going to love Kyle is Santa.<br><br>I'd wager around 1 extra hour of gameplay, depending, of course, on how quickly you find all of the endings and new secrets. Lemme' know how you like it!<br>-John",
