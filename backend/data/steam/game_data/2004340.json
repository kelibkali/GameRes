You, the Inquisitor, are the last hope in purging the Kingdom of Stormhaven of the evil that possesses it. Fight your way out of the ominous dungeon, explore the pillaged city and you’ll find a range of secrets to help you on your mission. Utilize a range of unique weapons, spells and items to defeat the horde of enemies that dwell across the kingdom.",
