The world has been lost to a demon apocalypse, the remnants of this devastation staining the landscape and leaving mere dozens of people alive. The wastes are harsh, and camaraderie is hard to come by. You play as Del, a bruiser who patrols the wastes in her truck. She's hardened by this dead world, but something softer lies beneath her violent exterior.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1667490/extras/9b2fa3a58a4280f7eb224898d7850ba3.avif?t=1626377701\" width=616 height=124 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1667490/extras/4294624a19997cb76bd2f72da11aae46.poster.avif?t=1626377701\" width=616 height=346 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1667490/extras/4294624a19997cb76bd2f72da11aae46.webm?t=1626377701\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1667490/extras/4294624a19997cb76bd2f72da11aae46.mp4?t=1626377701\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>Despite the destruction of it all, there are those in the end of the world who feel that perhaps the first time didn't quite take. On an average patrol, Del spots a pillar of fire in the distance and the source of it can only be one thing: demons have been summoned once more. But even demons can be innocent.
