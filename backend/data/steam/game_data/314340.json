That’s a good sequel.&quot;, &quot;it’s actually pretty damn good&quot; - Kotaku<br><br>&quot;Precision-honed but gleefully inventive.&quot; - Eurogamer<br><br>&quot;Open up a whole new realm of chess&quot; - BigSushi<br><br>&quot;Honestly, I don’t think I’ll ever play chess again- and it used to be something I quite enjoyed. But now I can’t see any context in which I wouldn’t just rather play Chess 2.&quot; - Scanline Media<br><br>&quot;The visual design is gorgeous and shows a loving attention to detail&quot; - Indie Statik",
