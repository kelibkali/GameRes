Stop wasting your productivity.</h2><br><strong>AquaSnap is a powerful window manager that helps you arrange and organize multiple applications on your desktop with minimum effort. It allows you to achieve maximum multitasking, especially if you own a high-resolution monitor or a multi-monitor setup.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Window docking</h2><strong>Split your desktop in one easy gesture</strong><br>Drag &amp; Drop your windows to the sides or corners of the screen and they are automatically resized to fit one half or one quarter of the screen. Just like the built-in Aero Snap function of Windows 10 but with more possibilities! This is especially useful on a 4K monitor or on multiple monitors.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/391050/extras/c6ca0e368dd60472d09aa406b6a745b2.poster.avif?t=1526112824\" width=322 height=242 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/391050/extras/c6ca0e368dd60472d09aa406b6a745b2.webm?t=1526112824\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/391050/extras/c6ca0e368dd60472d09aa406b6a745b2.mp4?t=1526112824\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Window tiling</h2><strong>Sometimes, splitting your desktop into halves or quarters is not ideal</strong><br>When two windows are side by side, resizing one of them while pressing [Ctrl] will also resize the other one.
