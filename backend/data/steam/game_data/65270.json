In a city where buildings are constructed as rapidly as they are torn down again, you get to take control of a demolition company which is growing bigger and going places. Lots of challenging missions lead you to various demolition sites in different districts of the city, where you can use your special vehicles and equipment to demolish buildings, complete missions and earn cash.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t\tTake a seat at the controls of a variety of authentic and detailed construction and demolition machines. Bring old buildings to the ground with wrecking balls and excavators. Tear down walls manually with the jackhammer, or place explosive charges, hit the button and watch the rubble and dust clouds fly! Use the wheel loader to transport rubble to the debris crusher where it gets pulverized. You can invest you hard-earned money in new vehicles which in turn unlock new assignments in the city and tutorials in your company's practice area.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t\tWhy don’t you demolish something today?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\" >Includes</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Large fleet of construction and demolition machines, including all machines from the original Demolition Company and the DLC Kit Pack PLUS additional new vehicles and equipment. <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Over 30 missions, including 6 NEW missions, in different parts of the city (financial district, port, factory area, shunting station, old town, suburbs PLUS HUGE new airport district). <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Exercise area with vehicle-specific tutorial missions. <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Explosions. <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Play with Keyboard, Mouse, Gamepad or Joystick. <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Gamepad support with authentic Euro-controls and support for multiple Joysticks simultaneously. <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Includes Mod SDK (contains Editor, Exporters and Sample Mods).</li></ul>",
