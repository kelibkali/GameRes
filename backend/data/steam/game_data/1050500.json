    "description": "Feed A Titanosaur is the ideal introduction to VR for a first time user <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is easy to control, delightfully original, and has a couple of very nice surprises all in a five-minute timeframe.  An informative voice-over guides users through the experience.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nAbout the experience <br />\r\nCome face to face with one of the largest creatures to ever walk planet Earth and feed it!  The object of this bite-sized educational project is to allow amazing facts to be delivered in an immersive VR experience, with a focus on our Titanosaur – Argentinosaurus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis ex was custom made fo museums and virtual reality experience centers, with the aim to provide short, easy to onboard but high impact  introduction to VR<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe love to innovate. In developing interactive installations for visitor centers, museums, and galleries we always aim to bring original concepts to life in new ways. This project blends the simple concept of dinosaur interaction with a friendly, highly detailed 3D mesh model, animating realistically and adjusting it’s poses based on the player’s actions – all delivered using an HTC Vive at room-scale.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a result, the team has delivered a memorable VR experience blending incredible facts with moments of surprise and delight.  In addition, running on an HTC Vive allows participants to move around the prehistoric landscape and inspect this Titanosaur up close using ‘dash’ teleport.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSir David Attenborough launched this experience last year at York Museum in the UK as part of their Yorkshire’s Jurassic World exhibition and now for the first time, it has been released for the VR arcade and educational use.  It is the ideal introduction to VR for the first time VR  users.  The experience is around five minutes in length.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Tremendous…    I imagine every child for miles around will want to see it!”<br />\r\nSir David Attenborough.",
